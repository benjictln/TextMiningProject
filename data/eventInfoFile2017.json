political circles Friday, as prosecutors pressed ahead with a flurry of corruption probes targeting not only opposition lawmakers but also a prominent figure from the ruling fold.Three senior lawmakers from the main opposition Liberty Korea Party have been in the prosecution's crosshairs for their graft allegations. Jun Byung-hun, a senior presidential aide, offered to resign Thursday over a bribery scandal involving his two former aides.Rumors have also persisted that the National Intelligence Service had handed illicit funds to several lawmakers during the former Park Geun-hye government, though NIS director Suh Hoon has said there is no evidence to back the allegations. This photo, taken Nov. 16, 2017, shows Jun Byung-hun, former senior presidential secretary for political affairs, bowing during a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. (Yonhap)The prosecution's plan to summon Jun next week has taken many in the ruling Democratic Party aback.\"It is only natural that the prosecution does not investigate only opposition lawmakers,\" a ruling party lawmaker told Yonhap News Agency on condition of anonymity. \"But I had no idea that its probe would extend even to one at the very center of power.\"During a press conference, Jun flatly denied any involvement in the scandal involving his former aides, who are suspected of pressuring a local home shopping channel in 2015 to donate 300 million won (US$271,400) to the Korea e-Sports Association, then chaired by Jun.The probes into the political circles have accelerated on the back of high public support. In a survey conducted a month ago by local pollster Realmeter, 65 percent viewed most of the probes as part of the efforts to \"eliminate accumulated ills.\"Some have viewed Jun's fall from grace as an intrigue to counter accusations of \"political retribution\" and pave the way for investigators to cast their net wider into the opposition camp.But some analysts suspect that the sprawling investigation into Jun could be blowback from the prosecution, as the ruling bloc has scathingly accused it of political bias and pushed to revamp it.The main opposition party appears to be on edge as three party grandees have been under investigation.LKP Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan is suspected of having pocketed illicit funds worth 100 million from the NIS while serving as deputy prime minister and finance minister under Park, reports have said. Choi denies it.Rep. Won Yoo-chul is suspected of receiving illicit political funds from some businessmen in his constituency in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, while Rep. Lee Woo-hyun is also under investigation for dubious transactions with an interior designer. Both deny any wrongdoings.Highlighting that all three lawmakers were among the close allies of ousted former President Park, LKP leader Hong Joon-pyo condemned the probes against them as \"politically motivated.\"\"It seems that (the government and ruling party) are resorting to all means possible to obliterate South Korea's conservative bloc,\" Hong said during a general meeting of LKP lawmakers on Monday.Some opposition lawmakers have voiced concerns that the probes may continue until June next year when local elections will take place and that they could turn the political pendulum in favor of the ruling bloc. (Yonhap)","1":"Presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said Thursday that South Korea has no authority to change the rules of engagement applied to the Joint Security Area amid controversy over its soldiers\u2019 decision not to return fire at North Korean soldiers who were chasing a defecting soldier. A Cheong Wa Dae official said the authority to change the rules falls under the United Nations Command. The UNC assumes operational control of the JSA, where the North Korean soldier had crossed toward the UNC-controlled area under about 40 rounds of heavy fire from his former comrades. \u201cWe could raise our opinion, but we have no authority to change the rules,\u201d the official told reporters under the customary condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s under the authority of the UNC. The Defense Ministry doesn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d The remark came after the report that the Defense Ministry is seeking to consult with the UNC to apply South Korea\u2019s own rule of engagement to the JSA when North Korea poses a direct threat to South Korean soldiers as they did during the incident Monday.\u00a0 Joint Security Area. Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea HeraldAlthough the South Korean Army took over the duty of keeping security inside the JSA from the US in 2004, the authority over the use of force falls under UNC commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, who doubles as the commander of USFK and US-led Combined Forces Command.The official also downplayed the remark by President Moon Jae-in, who told his presidential staff that a change to the rules of engagement is \u201cworthy of discussion\u201d after being briefed about the shooting incident Wednesday. \u201cIt was more like raising his opinion, not issuing an order,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe made observations from the perspective of average people. \u2026 Now that the president has made remarks, there could be further discussion with the UNC. President Moon said that if North Korea fires its bullets across the border, the general public expects the rules of engagement to require South Korean soldiers to at least fire \u201cwarning shots\u201d toward North Korean soldiers. Located inside the 4-kilometer-wide Demilitarized Zone, the JSA is jointly overseen by the UN Command and by North Korea, with South Korean and North Korean border guards facing each other only meters apart.Therefore, South Korean soldiers inside the JSA are not allowed to use military force unless their action is justified under the UNC rules of engagement applied to the JSA, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u201cThe UNC commander considers two parts to determine whether such a response is appropriate: whether there is a direct threat to our guards and whether our response would escalate the situation,\u201d JCS chief director of operations Gen. Suh Wook told lawmakers Wednesday.The soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, underwent a second surgery Wednesday at a hospital south of Seoul. The surgery was \u201csuccessful,\u201d but he is still in a critical condition, according to doctor Lee Cook-jong, who performed the operation.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","2":"South Korea's political parties pledged Thursday to work closely together to support recovery efforts in the earthquake-hit southeastern city of Pohang in a moment of bipartisanship.The 5.4 magnitude quake struck Pohang, 360 kilometers south of Seoul, on Wednesday, damaging more than 1,000 buildings, homes and vehicles, injuring at least 57 people and displacing a total of 1,536 people from their homes.\"(The government) has to focus on minimizing the damage, considering that additional aftershocks are forecast to occur,\" Back Hye-ryun, the spokeswoman of the ruling Democratic Party, told reporters. This photo, taken Sept. 24, 2017, shows Back Hye-ryun, the spokeswoman of the ruling Democratic Party, speaking during a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul. (Yonhap)\"It also has to actively consider financial measures necessary for the recovery efforts and help residents there go about their business as usual,\" she added.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party decided to form an in-house panel to discuss measures to support the recovery efforts and to strongly demand that the government declare the affected region a special disaster zone.\"Our party will make all-out efforts to support the restoration work and meticulously check earthquake-related measures during our upcoming budget deliberations,\" Chung Woo-taik, the party's floor leader, said during a meeting with senior party officials.The People's Party also vowed bipartisan cooperation and stressed the need for the government to mobilize all of its administrative capabilities to minimize human and property damage from the quake.\"Earthquakes have now become a real threat to our country, though we have so far regarded them as something that could only happen in other countries,\" Kim Dong-cheol, the party's floor leader, said.\"There is nothing that takes precedence over people's lives, properties and safety,\" he added. (Yonhap)","3":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 15\u00a0 -- The United States is unlikely to seek South Korea's permission should it decide to strike North Korea, a former US nuclear negotiator said Wednesday.Speaking at a forum, Robert Gallucci, who brokered the 1994 nuclear freeze deal with North Korea, said he delivered that view to President Moon Jae-in when they met in Seoul last month.\"It is completely understandable that the South Korean president and South Korean Assembly people and South Korean people would like ... to be consulted about any decision the United States would take, which would cause retaliation by the North against the South,\" he said.But Gallucci noted that US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis once said it would be \"game on\" if North Korea takes action that directly threatens the US or its allies. Robert Gallucci, head of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, smiles with Choo Mi-ae, leader of South Korea`s ruling Democratic Party, at a forum held at the think tank in Washington on Nov. 15, 2017. (Yonhap)\"He didn't say if that happens, the president sends an emissary to the Blue House and we will consult and ask permission of South Koreans as to whether we can adequately defend America and its interests,\" he said, referring to South Korea's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae. \"He didn't say that because it's not true.\"Gallucci, who now heads the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, noted it would have been useful for Moon and US President Donald Trump to discuss the issue during the summit last week if it was so important to Seoul.He added the caveat that he does not think Washington would take military action without communicating its decision with Seoul, but the bilateral alliance does not mean the US will not defend itself if necessary.\"It means we will take action taking full account of our obligations to our allies South Korea and Japan,\" he said.Gallucci made the remarks shortly after he took part in a separate public discussion with South Korea's ruling Democratic Party leader Choo Mi-ae.Choo, who is currently on a visit to Washington, had told the forum that South Korea would not accept war on the Korean Peninsula without its consent under any circumstances.\"I find that a reach, which is my way of saying it's not likely at all,\" Gallucci said.The 1994 agreement he negotiated called for North Korea to freeze and ultimately dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for political and economic concessions. It later fell through with the outbreak of the second nuclear crisis in 2012 after the North was found to have been running a clandestine program to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. (Yonhap)","4":"A Chinese delegation will visit South Korea next week to explain the outcome of its recent party congress, the Chinese Embassy in Seoul said Wednesday.The delegation led by He Yiting, executive vice president of the Communist Party's top education institute, will arrive in Seoul on Tuesday for a three-day stay, according to the embassy. He Yiting (Yonhap)The delegation's trip to Seoul is intended to share the outcome of the 19th party congress. Exactly who it will meet here has yet to be confirmed.China wrapped up its weeklong 19th party congress last month, in which President Xi Jinping cemented his power as he entered his second five-year term.Last month, South Korea and China agreed to mend bilateral ties strained by a prolonged feud over the deployment of a US anti-missile system called THAAD in South Korea.Earlier, China announced that Xi will send Song Tao, the head of the international department at the Central Committee of the Communist Party, to North Korea later this week as a special envoy to exchange opinions about \"issues of mutual concern, including party-to-party matters and bilateral ties, along with the party congress.\" (Yonhap)","5":"Former President Lee Myung-bak is facing increasing heat over suspicions he was involved in the election interference scandal surrounding the military and national spy agency.\u00a0Former President Lee Myung-bak enters a vehicle at the Incheon Airport after arriving in the country from Bahrain on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Rep. Kim Dong-cheol, floor leader of the minor opposition People\u2019s Party, on Tuesday urged the prosecution to question Lee, accusing the former president of being the root of \u201caccumulated ills.\u201d Since taking office in May, President Moon Jae-in has focused on addressing irregularities in government and society, which he has termed \u201caccumulated evils.\u201d \u201cThe country\u2019s top intelligence agencies were ruined in the hands of those in power during the two (Lee and Park Geun-hye) administrations,\u201d Kim said at the party\u2019s supreme council meeting. \u201cHowever, former President Lee and the Liberty Korea Party act as though they are not responsible, and resist (the government\u2019s drive to) clean out accumulated ills.\u201d Won Sei-hoon, one of Lee\u2019s closest associates and a former National Intelligence Service chief, is accused of ordering illegal online campaign to sway public opinion in favor of the conservatives in the run up to the 2012 presidential election. It is alleged that Won ordered the NIS and the military\u2019s cyberwarfare unit to incite anti-Moon sentiments online, and that Lee is likely to have been aware of his actions. In the 2012 election, Moon was defeated by former President Park. Lee and the main opposition Liberty Korea Party have attacked the government\u2019s reform plans, accusing the new administration of politically motivated revenge against the conservative bloc. Liberty Korea Party Chairman Hong Joon-pyo on Wednesday accused the administration of disregarding the future of the country, saying developments surrounding the NIS were mob justice.The NIS reform committee launched by Moon has reviewed a large number of the NIS\u2019 past activities and has turned evidence over to the public prosecutors\u2019 office. The committee\u2019s findings sparked an expanding probe that has brought all three of the Park administration\u2019s NIS chiefs under scrutiny. Allegations the former top NIS officials face include funneling the agency\u2019s funds into Cheong Wa Dae illegally and hampering the investigation into Won\u2019s alleged political meddling. Saying the NIS has been branded a criminal organization by the new government, Hong accused past liberal governments of crippling the spy agency. \u201cDisbanding the NIS, and replacing it with a \u2018North Korea cooperation bureau\u2019 would fit their claims,\u201d Hong said. \u201cThe past left-wing administrations operated the NIS as such for 10 years, and the right-wing governments changed that organization into one that monitors North Korea.\u201dHong also accused the Moon administration of taking over the country \u201clike a revolutionary army\u201d that has no regard for the country\u2019s future. Lee, who returned from a trip to Bahrain on Wednesday, has spoken out against the reform drive. He has stated that he believes the Moon administration\u2019s actions may have ulterior motives. \u201cI have started to have suspicions about whether they really are reforms, or an expression of pent-up emotions or political reprisals,\u201d Lee said Sunday before departing for the tiny Arabian Gulf country. He added the reform drive could divide public opinion and compromise the country\u2019s national security.

Such jackets are similar to those worn by sports players on the bench. A report said a housewife in Daegu surnamed Kim felt compelled to buy her daughter, who is in junior high, a long padded jacket that cost 500,000 won ($450). Kim initially hesitated over the price, but her daughter had insisted on having one, as she did not want to be \u201csingled out\u201d by her classmates.\u00a0(Yonhap)Students wearing long padded jackets can be easily spotted on the streets these days. One high school student said, \u201cI think more than half of my peers wear it. I had to ask my parents many times before they bought me one.\u201d Jackets vary widely in price, ranging from 50,000 won to over 1 million won. However, some students are not satisfied with those that cost less than 200,000 won, according to reports that quoted parents.Therefore, parents have begun calling expensive long padded jackets \u201cspine breakers\u201d in Korean, referring to how they are so pricey and burdensome. Another parent surnamed Hwang said she had bought her middle school daughter an expensive winter coat last year, but had to buy her the popular long-padded coat this year. Similar to other Korean parents, Hwang expressed concerns over the financial burden of the long padded coats.

It was the second-biggest earthquake that hit South Korea in recent history. Last year, a magnitude 5.8 quake struck the historic city of Gyeongju and damaged many cultural assets there. A cultural official checks Cheomseongdae, an astronomical observatory, in Gyeongju, some 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on Sept. 20, 2016, one day after a magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck the ancient city with no immediate casualties or serious damage. The temblor was an aftershock of two strong quakes, registering magnitudes of 5.8 and 5.1, respectively, which hit the city a week ago. (Yonhap)The CHA said no cracks or damage were immediately spotted in the city's historic buildings such as the 1,300-year-old astronomical observatory Cheomseongdae and the Seokguram Grotto.

A quake that struck South Korea last year at magnitude 5.8 in the nearby city of Gyeongju is the only stronger one on record.The initial quake, the second largest on record in South Korea, was followed by a 4.6-magnitude quake at about 4:49 p.m.According to the Ministry of Interior and Safety, no fatalities were immediately reported to the authorities. As of 5 p.m., 10 light injuries were reported in Daegu and the North Gyeongsang Province area.\u00a0 Cheong Wa Dae said that President Moon Jae-in was briefed on the earthquake on his way to Seoul from Manila, and convened a meeting with his senior aides immediately upon arrival.

People on Jeju Island also reported buildings shaking, books falling from shelves and frames falling off walls.

Trump has said that China should do more to rein in its wayward neighbor. Chinese President Xi Jinping (Yonhap)North Korea's ties with China, its main ally and economic benefactor, have been frayed over Pyongyang's persistent advancement of its nuclear and missile programs. China has implemented U.N. sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests.\"China and North Korea will exchange opinions about issues of mutual concern including party-to-party matters and bilateral ties, along with the party congress,\" Geng Shuang, spokesman at China's foreign ministry, said in a briefing.Song may meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who sent a congratulatory message last month to Xi for being reelected as the head of the CPC and expressed hope for better ties. It would mark the first trip to the North by a high-level Chinese official since October 2016 when Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin visited Pyongyang. In October 2015, Liu Yunshan, then a member of the CPC politburo standing committee, visited North Korea to watch a military parade to mark the ruling party's founding anniversary.Experts see the Chinese envoy's planned visit to the North as an attempt by Beijing to share the outcome of not just its recent party congress but also that of the summit held between Xi and Trump. They also said that it seems to be part of China's efforts to mend ties with neighboring countries, including North Korea, but cautioned that it remains to be seen whether it will herald any \"imminent breakthrough\" in the current North Korean nuclear stalemate. \"China seems to have been working on mending ties with its neighbors before and after the 19th party congress,\" said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. \"It remains to be seen whether that will be part of China's diplomatic strategy or is intended to send a message to the North on its nuclear and missile programs.\"North Korea has not carried out any major provocations since Sept. 15, raising expectations that the US could seek direct talks with the North.Joseph Yun, US special representative for North Korea policy, reportedly said at a recent meeting that if North Korea halted nuclear and missile testing for about 60 days, that would be the signal Washington needs to resume direct dialogue with Pyongyang.On Tuesday, Yun told reporters in Seoul that he does not know why the North has halted its provocations as Pyongyang has not communicated with the US in that regard, but he urged the North to stay provocation-free \"for a period of time,\" adding that it would be a \"good start.\" (Yonhap)","11":"The US State Department said Tuesday that it will soon meet with a US citizen who was arrested for crossing the Civilian Control Line without permission in an alleged attempt to enter North Korea earlier this week, a US broadcaster reported. \u00a0\"We are aware of media reports regarding the detention of a US citizen in the Republic of Korea, near the border with North Korea,\" Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the US State Department told Voice of America.

Prosecutors suspect the money may have been channeled into a secret fund belonging to Park.They also think that the amount of monthly payments doubled to about 100 million won when Lee Byung-kee and Lee Byong-ho headed the NIS from about 50 million won when Nam was leading the agency.

(Yonhap)","13":"NEW YORK\/SEOUL - A United Nations panel adopted a resolution Tuesday calling for stepped-up efforts to improve human rights conditions in North Korea.The Third Committee, which oversees humanitarian issues, approved the text for the 13th consecutive year, with new emphasis on the need to resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War and provide assistance to foreign nationals detained in the North.The resolution is expected to be put to a full UN General Assembly vote next month.The assembly \"condemns the long-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\" according to a draft resolution. (Yonhap)It points to the UN Commission of Inquiry's landmark 2014 report that details abuses ranging from torture and rape to public executions and retaliation against asylum seekers repatriated from abroad.In the latest high-profile defection, a presumed North Korean soldier crossed the inter-Korean border into the South on Monday. He is reportedly in critical condition after being shot by four other North Korean soldiers who chased him.The resolution also \"strongly urges\" the North Korean government to \"immediately put an end\" to the human rights violations and provide foreign detainees with access to diplomatic missions in the country as well as any other necessary arrangements to \"confirm their status and to communicate with their families.\"There are currently three Americans and six South Koreans held in the North. In June, an American college student who was arrested in Pyongyang last year died days after being returned to the US in a coma.On the reunions, the assembly notes that it is an \"urgent humanitarian concern\" of the Korean people due to the advanced age of many of the separated family members, and calls on both South and North Korea to resume the meetings that were suspended in late2015.South Korea welcomed the UN's adoption of the resolution and called on the North to take immediate action to improve its dire human rights conditions. \"The government urges the North once again to take detailed and substantive steps immediately in accordance with the recommendations of the UN resolution,\" the foreign ministry said in a commentary issued in the name of its spokesman.North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Ja Song-nam, said his country \"categorically\" rejects the resolution.\"The draft resolution represents a product of the political and military confrontation plot and the conspiracy of the US and other hostile forces to the DPRK, and the extreme manifestation of politicization, selectivity and the double standards of human rights,\" he said in remarks before the committee ahead of the text's adoption.He then left the meeting room.The resolution was jointly penned by the European Union and Japan, with the contributions of 60 nations including South Korea. (Yonhap)","14":"Nearly six months after the May presidential election, the fortunes of its five main candidates have seen some twists and turns. But three of them are now finding themselves back in a familiar race against one another, this time as leaders of their respective parties. With Rep. Yoo Seong-min elected Monday to helm the Bareun Party, the three leaders -- Yoo, Hong Joon-pyo of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party and Ahn Cheol-soo of the minor People\u2019s Party -- will vie to gain a foothold at the National Assembly as opposition leaders and to confront the ruling liberal party.\u00a0 Ahn Cheol-soo (left), Hong Joon-pyo, Yoo Seong-min (Yonhap)From the way things look now, Hong, who finished second in the election after President Moon Jae-in, appears to be in better shape than the other two. The firebrand politician was a non-mainstreamer in his Liberty Korea Party before the poll, but the better-than-expected 23 percent finish in the election boosted his political clout. Leading the Liberty Korea Party since July, Hong is pushing his reform plans, albeit slowly and with difficulty, recently expelling the disgraced former party head and former President Park Geun-hye from the party. In the latest poll by Realmeter on Monday, the main opposition party stood at second place among the five major political parties, posting 18.6 percent of support among 2,533 respondents. Rep. Yoo, the Bareun Party leader who landed fourth in the presidential election, has never strayed from his campaign motto -- true conservatism -- but the past six months have proven that it is not an easy task. Yoo\u2019s party started with 33 lawmakers, including himself, who defected from the Liberty Korea Party in December. At the time, they sought to cut ties with old and corrupted politics and vowed to pursue the \u201ctrue values\u201d of conservatism, in the wake of the massive corruption scandal that led to the ouster of former President Park. Before the election, 13 lawmakers of the 33 left the party. Since then, the party has continued to tread a tight rope. It lost its parliamentary negotiation bloc status after a second round of mass defection on Nov. 8, and now holds 11 seats at the National Assembly. At least 20 is required to maintain the negotiating group status.The new leader now has the daunting task of preventing further defections and to maintain its survival at the National Assembly. He is pushing for a broad centrist-conservative alliance -- mainly with the People\u2019s Party.Meanwhile, People\u2019s Party Chairman Ahn appears to be on an uphill battle, as his party is struggling to gain support from the public. He was once considered a match against incumbent President Moon Jae-in during the electioneering period, but was beaten by conservative leader Hong, placing third in the election with 21.4 percent of votes. While he seeks to advocate \u201cradical centrist\u201d policies, his direction is often questioned due to ambiguity. The party lost supporters as it went through a series of scandals including one in which several of its members were found to have fabricated evidence to raise suspicions against the son of its rival candidate Moon during the presidential election. The minor opposition currently ranks last in the poll with 5.3 percent of support. Previously, the presidential candidate and the chairwoman of the far-left Justice Party, Rep. Sim Sang-jeung had contributed much to the higher-than-usual rate of support from the public, which stood at 5.8 percent in Monday\u2019s poll. She resigned from the post in July and Rep. Lee Jeong-mi now leads the party that has six parliamentary seats. The election winner President Moon and his governing Democratic Party of Korea are enjoying an unseen level of popularity from the public. President Moon\u2019s popularity appears to be much higher than the figure he earned as a candidate, which was 41.1 percent of the national vote cast. In the latest poll, he garnered 70.1 percent of approval rate, while the ruling Democratic Party topped the list of political parties with 48.2 percent.

The resolution was drafted by the United States and negotiated with the North's closest ally, China.\"We define this 'sanctions resolution' rigged up by the US and its followers as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our Republic, as an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region and categorically reject the 'resolution,\"' North Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement. Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)The ministry said the sanctions are tantamount to a \"complete economic blockade\" of North Korea.\"If the US wishes to live safely, it must abandon its hostile policy towards the DPRK and learn to co-exist with the country that has nuclear weapons and should wake up from its pipe dream of our country giving up nuclear weapons which we have developed and completed through all kinds of hardships,\" said the statement, carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.DPRK is short for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The resolution adopted by the Security Council includes sharply lower limits on North Korea's refined oil imports, the return home of all North Koreans working overseas within 24 months, and a crackdown on ships smuggling banned items including coal and oil to and from the country.The Trump administration's success in achieving the resolution won praise from the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin of Maryland. \"That was a good move,\" the senator said, \"a major accomplishment.\" Cardin said the stepped-up sanctions should be followed by diplomacy aimed at bringing the US and China together on a sustained effort to ease tensions in that region. Cardin spoke on \"Fox News Sunday.\"But the resolution doesn't include even harsher measures sought by the Trump administration that would ban all oil imports and freeze international assets of the government and its leader, Kim Jong-un.The resolution drew criticism from Russia for the short time the Security Council nations had to consider the draft, and last-minute changes to the text. Two of those changes were extending the deadline for North Korean workers to return home from 12 months to 24 months _ which Russia said was the minimum needed _ and reducing the number of North Koreans being put on the UN sanctions blacklist from 19 to 15.

In his academic papers published in the early 2000s, Hong referred to chaebol as \"cancer cells,\" arguing their relentless business expansion has driven small firms into insolvency \"I will take more caution in light of what you have pointed out,\" he said.Despite criticism coming thick and fast, Hong said he had no intention of giving up the nomination for the ministerial post.\"I have lived my entire life for small enterprises, small merchants and the self-employed, and I believe I have to contribute to supporting them,\" he said. \"I will try hard to address the suspicion surrounding me and gain your trust.\"The ruling party came to the defense of the nominee, insisting he is \"well-suited\" for the post.\"Experts say that what his family did in the process of wealth transfers did not run afoul of any law,\" Woo Won-shik, the party's floor leader, said, highlighting his past role as a civil activist and lawmaker who advocated for fairness and transparency in the country's economy.During his opening remarks at the hearing, Hong reiterated his commitment to preventing larger firms from stealing small subcontractors' technologies under unfair deals and to allaying concerns about the potential impact of Moon's policy plans, such as raising the minimum wage.\"There have been numerous policies and government spending (announcements), but SMEs, startups and small merchants are still going through difficulties,\" he said. \"We are in dire need of real outcomes, and I would like to play a role in meeting that need.\" (Yonhap)","30":"SUWON -- The Suwon District Court said Friday it issued an oral warning to one of its judges after she was arrested in the US territory of Guam for leaving her children in a car unattended while she and her husband shopped.The 35-year-old judge, identified only by her surname Sul, and her lawyer husband were arrested on charges of child abuse last month after they left their two children, a six-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl, in their car while they stopped at a Kmart grocery store.They were released after each paid a $500 fine.

Forty-seven others were also interviewed as witnesses, including the doctor who treated Kim's daughter as well as TV journalist Lee.Officials said they determined there was no evidence that the widow intentionally neglected the daughter.Police have confirmed that the daughter was diagnosed with a simple cold and experts have also told police that her condition could have deteriorated rapidly because she was suffering from a rare disease known as Kabuki syndrome. Investigators also took into consideration the fact that an autopsy of her body at the time determined that she died of a lung disease and that no unusual elements other than cold medicine were found in her blood. The outcome is in line with the investigation 10 years ago.At that time, police also closed the daughter's case as accidental, based on the autopsy that concluded her death was caused by acute pneumonia, with no signs of external injuries.

(AP)His talks with Moon will likely focus on ways to bring the reclusive North to denuclearization talks.The South Korean leader has often emphasized that any pressure on the North should aim to change the way the communist regime behaves and encourage it to come to the dialogue table.In their last bilateral summit, held on the sidelines of a U.N. gathering in New York in September, Moon and Trump stressed the need to put \"the strongest pressure and sanctions against North Korea to deter North Korea's provocative activities and make it start taking steps toward denuclearization.\"They are widely expected to introduce a more detailed action plan to increase pressure on the communist state. The countries have already agreed to boost the rotational deployment of US strategic assets to South Korea and its surrounding areas as a way of boosting the countries' combined deterrence, which they said will also include South Korea's development or acquisition of advanced defense capabilities.Many other bilateral and regional issues also await the two leaders, who have so far held two bilateral meetings and two three-way summit talks involving Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.The Trump administration has demanded a revision of the Korea-US free trade agreement (FTA) that went into effect five years ago, blaming it for the US' growing trade deficit with South Korea.The process to modify the bilateral free trade pact was officially launched last month though Seoul insists the FTA has been and continues to be mutually beneficial.How to share the burden of keeping 28,500 US troops here also remains what many believe to be a potential deal breaker, though few believe the upcoming defense cost sharing talks will cause any serious problem for the alliance.Shortly after his arrival here, the US president will hold a meeting with the combined forces of South Korea and the US at Camp Humphreys, a US military base located some 40 kilometers south of Seoul in Pyeongtaek.Moon and Trump will hold a joint press conference following their bilateral and expanded summit talks at Cheong Wa Dae.A state dinner will be held at Cheong Wa Dae later in the day, involving some 120 top government officials and business leaders from the two countries.On Wednesday, the US president will make a special speech at the National Assembly, becoming the first US president to do so in 24 years, according to Cheong Wa Dae officials.He will later head to China, the third stop in his Asian tour that will also take him to Vietnam and the Philippines for a series of regional forums, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. (Yonhap)","49":"WASHINGTON -- A former US envoy said Monday that North Korea's nuclear crisis could be resolved through a \"freeze-for-freeze\" agreement between Washington and Pyongyang.Bill Richardson, who served as ambassador to the United Nations in the 1990s and played important roles in past dealings with Pyongyang, made the remark as President Donald Trump is in Asia to increase pressure on the regime.\"What's the best diplomatic option? I think it's the freeze for a freeze,\" he said at a forum here, using the term for a proposal China and Russia have made to de-escalate tensions over the North's nuclear and missile programs. Bill Richardson (AP)Under that proposal, South Korea and the US would halt their regular military exercises in exchange for North Korea stopping its nuclear and missile tests. Seoul and Washington have rejected it.But Richardson said the US could enter into talks with North Korea on the condition that Pyongyang stops its weapons testing for two months. During that period, the US would also suspend some of its military maneuvers near the Korean Peninsula, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal.\"Just something (like) that for 30 days, or 60 days, you talk and you see how that goes and maybe start talking about other issues,\" he said.Richardson added that he knows the North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, and he is a \"reasonable guy.\" \"He's the one that says they're going to send the bomb across the Pacific,\" the former New Mexico governor noted. \"He doesn't sound very reasonable to you, but I've talked to him. I think you could deal with him.\"He mused that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ri may already be talking.\"They probably want relief on sanctions. I don't think, unlike his father, this guy wants massive assistance,\" Richardson said, referring first to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and then to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un.\"I don't think he wants food assistance. I don't think he wants nuclear power plants. He wants a certain engagement and legitimacy.The ego is more important than helping his own people.\" (Yonhap)","50":"Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon on Friday called large companies irreplaceable partners in the government's drive for economic growth, apparently seeking to quell any criticism the incumbent government may be leaning toward siding with the labor.\"No one can deny the contribution the economic leaders have made to the Republic of Korea,\" the prime minister said while meeting with 18 leaders of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"Also, the KCCI's role has been growing, and it will continue to grow at a more rapid pace,\" Lee added.The meeting at the prime minister's official residence followed earlier reports that President Moon Jae-in may not attend the annual new year's gathering for business leaders. (Yonhap)The\u00a0reports prompted concerns that the liberal president may be trying to keep its distance from business leaders, especially because they came hours after Moon held a special meeting at his own office with some 120 union leaders and company officials to praise them for their co-prosperity campaign.Cheong Wa Dae has acknowledged the president may miss the new year's meeting with business leaders, to be hosted by the KCCI, but that he plans to invite business leaders to a similar meeting at his office that will also involve leaders of other areas.\"I ask all the chairpersons (of business groups), including KCCI chairman Park Yong-maan, to continue offering great instructions for the good of the business circle and the entire Republic of Korea,\" Prime Minister Lee told the meeting. \"The government too will continue to communicate with you without any disruption.\"The prime minister also sought to win their support for government efforts to create more jobs and boost household income.Lee said the country's per capita income was expected to breach the $30,000 mark in the near future, but that the new feat will also come with three new challenges.\"First, we must continue to grow through innovation and new industries. The second challenge is that we must continue to push for people-oriented, income-led growth because there are many people who do not realize our per capita income is nearing $30,000 and, in fact, many rather feel they are now worse off,\" he said.The third requirement is to transform the system to prepare the country for new changes.

(Yonhap)Last week the neighbors reached a broad agreement to end more than one year of diplomatic friction over the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea.She said the government will work with China so that the deployment issue would not impede bilateral relations. It will also further step up cooperation with its neighbor to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue in a peaceful manner, she noted. Kang also hinted at Moon\u2019s possible visit to Japan. The government \u201cwill push for the leader\u2019s trip to Japan on the occasion of a Japan-hosted summit meeting of the three countries,\u201d she said. Japan is reportedly pushing to host a much delayed trilateral meeting with South Korea and China by the end of this year. Seoul will also review \u201cultra powerful\u201d punitive measures against North Korea, such as shutting off the oil supply to the country and a ban on the country\u2019s export of workers, in the event of further military provocations, the foreign minister said. South Korea plans to capitalize on the country\u2019s hosting of the 2018 Winter Olympics to secure international support and the momentum to improve relations with North Korea and denuclearize the country, she added.Bickering erupted between ruling and opposition party lawmakers during the committee\u2019s meeting as opposition members denounced South Korea\u2019s recent pledges made in the agreement with China. They said South Korea\u2019s promises that it will not deploy additional parts of the THAAD system, will not join the U.S.Missile Defense and will not expand its military alliance with the U.S. into a trilateral alliance including Japan amount to giving up sovereign rights.\u201cThese are what the government has said openly and repeatedly and what are needed for national interest and security,\u201d Kang defended the announcement. Asked whether Seoul will not install additional THAAD components in any case, she said further deployment \u201cis not being considered for now.\u201d (Yonhap)","52":"Nine lawmakers of the minor conservative Bareun Party said Monday they will defect to the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, as the right wing realigns ahead of next year\u2018s local elections. With the defections, the splinter Bareun Party will lose its status as a parliamentary negotiating bloc, which requires at least 20 seats at the 299-member National Assembly. The number of the remaining legislators is 11.\u00a0 Members of minor opposition Bareun Party announce their defection at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)\u201cToday, we will leave Bareun Party to take the first step to the path of grand reunion of the conservatives,\u201d three-term lawmaker Rep. Kim Young-woo said in a press briefing at the National Assembly.\u201cWe could not help but accept the call from voters supporting the conservatives, as we see the Moon Jae-in administration\u2019s mishandling of national security issues with the North and its populistic economic policies,\u201d six-term lawmaker Kim Moo-sung said, adding that their decision only comes to reinforce the conservative bloc that has been struggling to gain much public support. The leaving members include the six-term politician, Kim Young-woo, Kang Ghil-boo, Kim Yong-tae and Hwang Young-cheul. One of them is the party\u2019s interim chief and the Floor Leader, Rep. Joo Ho-young. He will discard party membership after a new party chairman is picked at the convention slated for next Monday, he said. The defecting members will submit the written notification of their quitting to the party on Wednesday and will join the bigger conservative party the following day, Rep. Kim Yong-tae explained. The 20-member party has been facing a factional feud between those supporting the independence of the party and those seeking to merge with other political parties, as they suffered from low approval rates. According to the lawmakers, they gathered on Sunday night to reduce the gap but failed to draw out a consensus.After the announcement, the remaining 11 members expressed regret over the decision.\u201cI cannot understand the members leaving the party and am regretful,\u201d four-term lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who led the faction supporting the independence, said. He is currently running for party chairman, and was previously the party\u2019s presidential candidate. \u201cThe remaining members will make the utmost effort to persuade those who have not decided to stay in the party,\u201d he said, adding that the party will proceed with their preparation for their leadership contest slated on Monday. Two candidates withdrew their candidacy earlier in the day, but the remaining four nominees participated in the scheduled candidate debate in the afternoon. In January, the minor conservative party split off from the then ruling Saenuri Party before it rebranded itself as Liberty Korea Party, after a corruption scandal broke out involving the then President Park Guen-hye and many of her close aides, and her confidante Choi Soon-sil. At the time, the 33 members had vowed to reform the conservatives and promote the true values of conservatism. But 13 members left the splinter party to go back to Liberty Korea Party after the presidential election in May, leaving 20 members.Monday\u2019s announcement of the defection comes after the Liberty Korea Party took away the membership of the jailed former President Park on Friday. Park is currently standing trial after the Constitutional Court removed her from office in March.

The speech was delivered in front of 2 million people at Ramna Race Course in Dhaka, and called on the Bengali people of modern-day Bangladesh to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilization by erstwhile West Pakistan. Bangladesh became an internationally recognized sovereign state in 1972 after a bitter war with Pakistan, which sought to control its eastern territory after the two geographically separated nations broke away from India in 1947 and formed the Pakistani Federation. The decision by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on Oct. 30 to include the speech in the Memory of the World International Register, a list of the world\u2019s important documentary heritage, was welcomed by the Bangladesh government. \u201cThe world will now get to know more about our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and our glorious Liberation War,\u201d said Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali. \u201cThe March 7th speech provided inspiration to the Bengali people in their quest for freedom and emancipation.

Byun Chang-hoon, a prosecutor at the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office, jumped off a four-story building in southern Seoul around 2:30 p.m., the office said. He was transferred to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about two hours later, it said. There was no suicide note.\u00a0 The photo, filed on Nov. 6, 2017, shows Byun Chang-hoon, a prosecutor at the Seoul High Prosecutors` Office.Byun was set to appear in a court hearing to review the prosecution's request for his arrest for alleged involvement in a cover-up of election meddling by the National Intelligence Service in the run-up to the 2012 presidential vote. Prosecutors have been widening their probe into illicit cyberoperations by the NIS aimed at swaying public opinion in favor of the then Lee Myung-bak government. When the prosecution began its first probe into the NIS scandal in 2013, Byun had been dispatched to the spy agency as a legal advisor. The NIS assigned him to a task force to deal with the prosecution probe and court proceedings. Byun is accused of setting up bogus cyberoperation offices and making fake documents to conceal NIS agents' political activities and instructing cyberteam crews to lie to the prosecution and court. Last month, Byun was demoted to a lower post from a senior-level position at the Seoul Northern District Prosecutors' Office after he became a subject in the investigation. He and two other ranking prosecutors faced court hearings on their arrest warrants.

J. Herbert Nelson II, who is stated clerk of the denomination's General Assembly and leader of the 16-member delegation, made the remark during a news conference in Seoul, saying that as a US citizen, he apologizes for the mass killings.The US Presbyterian Church has been a vocal supporter of the victims of the massacre at the village of Nogun-ri in central South Korea. In September, the denomination sent letters to US President Donald Trump and the Congress, calling for an acknowledgment of responsibility and an offer of compensation to victims. The Rev. J. Herbert Nelson II, leader of the US Presbyterian Church delegation, speaks during a news conference in Seoul on Nov. 6, 2017. (Yonhap)The Nogun-ri killings became widely known after a Pulitzer Prize-winning report from the Associated Press in 1999 that quoted US veterans as saying that commanders ordered them to shoot refugees seeking shelter under a railroad bridge.The official death toll was 150, though some say the number of deaths could have been as many as 300. Then-US President Bill Clinton expressed regret, but stopped short of offering an official apology. US officials claimed that an investigation has found that no official order was given to fire on the civilians.Last week, the Presbyterian Church delegation paid a visit to the Nogun-ri site and met with victims.The delegation has been on a trip aimed at promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula and the eventual reunification of the two Koreas. The trip also included a visit to the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas last week.The delegation also includes the Rev. Jose Luis Casal, director of Presbyterian World Mission; the Rev.

The figure came to 40.7 percent for males and 6.4 percent for females.The data covers those who have been consuming more than five packets of cigarettes over their lifetime, and are currently smoking. (Yonhap)South Korea's smoking rate showed signs of decline shortly after the government levied a 2,000 won ($1.79) tax per packet starting January 2015.The smoking rate for males reached 39.4 percent for all of 2015, marking the first time for the figure to hover below 40 percent after the country started compiling the data in 1998.The government said it plans to continue expanding the number of smoking-free zones and ban advertisements of tobacco products to curb the rising number of smokers in the country.More South Koreans also became obese, the ministry's data showed.South Korea's obesity rate reached 34.8 percent in 2016, up from 33.2 percent a year earlier. Around two out of five males and one out of four females were categorized as obese, the data showed. (Yonhap)","58":"South Korean health authorities have found an unusual and disturbing trend in the use of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. In the month before the national college entrance exam, the rate of diagnosis and prescription picks up markedly in the same age groups as the test-takers.\u00a0 123rfWhile prescriptions of ADHD drugs last year fell around 10 percent compared to the 2011 level, the figures for 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds shot up by 64 percent and 37 percent, respectively, according to data from the state-run Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The amount spent on medication by ADHD patients also showed a clear link to the college entrance test, which takes place in November. Total spending on ADHD drugs peaked at 90.2 million won ($80,900) in October in 2015, a month before the exam, and significantly dropped to 58.3 million won and 55.8 million won in November and December. ADHD is a mental disorder that prevents children from concentrating for schoolwork and results in disruptive behavior. But those trends suggest that the ADHD drugs are being abused by students preparing for exams as study aids.This prompted the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to issue a public warning against possible side effects of the misguided use of the drugs. \u201cADHD drugs are strictly prescription drugs and are not to be used as study aids,\u201d it said in a press release last week. Abuse of ADHD drugs can lead to depression, hallucinations, aggressive behavior and a strong urge to commit suicide, it stressed. Local news outlets reported some even illegally obtain the ADHD drugs through online channels, as they cannot purchase them elsewhere without prescriptions. The stimulant medication is used to treat ADHD as it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain.There are currently 60 different ADHD drugs sold here, composed of stimulants including clonidine, methylphenidate and atomoxetine hydrochloride, according to the ministry.

During his three-day visit to Japan, Trump will meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the two will likely reaffirm their stance of applying pressure on Pyongyang.Trump arrives in Asia at a time of heightened tensions, caused by the North's sixth and most powerful nuclear blast test in September and a series of ballistic missile launches.Last Thursday, H.R. McMaster, national security adviser to Trump, also said the US is considering relisting North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, since the North appeared to fit the criteria for designation following its alleged murder of leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother early this year.Under a law enacted Aug. 2, the State Department had to determine within 90 days, or around last Thursday, whether North Korea should be back on the list.North Korea was placed on the list in 1988 for an airliner bombing that killed all 115 people aboard. In 2008, it was taken off in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.The US left North Korea off its latest list of state sponsors of terrorism in July.State sponsors of terrorism face restrictions on US foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and financial and other sanctions. But relisting North Korea is largely seen as symbolic because it is already under extensive sanctions for its nuclear and missile programs.On Sunday, Trump also defined North Korea as \"a big problem,\"and added the North will figure prominently in talks in Japan, South Korea and China.\"(North Korea) is a big problem for our country and for the world, and we want to get it solved,\" Trump was quoted as saying by AFP.The president, however, praised North Korean people as \"great\"and \"industrious.\"\"They're warm, much warmer than the world really knows or understands,\" he said. \"They're great people. And I hope it all works out for everybody.\"But Trump defended his tough rhetoric on North Korea, which he'd previously threatened to \"totally destroy.\"Without giving further details, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, \"There's been 25 years of total weakness and so we're taking a very much different approach.\"Then to US troops at Yokota Air Base, on the outskirts of Tokyo, Trump said, \"No one, no dictator, no regime... should underestimate American resolve.\"North Korea may well take provocative action with Trump in the region.

Choo Myeong-ho, a former chief of the National Intelligence Service domestic intelligence unit, enters the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in Seoul on Nov. 3, 2017. (Yonhap)The prosecution had sought to arrest Choo on charges of abuse of power and violation of NIS law banning its political involvement.The prosecution first requested an arrest warrant last month, but it was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence to prove his wrongdoing. The prosecutors then conducted an additional investigation into Choo and added the charge of managing NIS' illegal civilian surveillance. Choo reported the surveillance work, which included spying on Woori Bank CEO Lee Kwang-goo, to Woo Byeong-woo, former presidential secretary for civil affairs to the now-ousted former President Park Geun-hye, according to the prosecutors.Choo is also suspected of handing 5 million won ($4,482) each month to Park's former aides including Cho Yoon-sun and Hyun Ki-hwan, who both served as presidential secretary for political affairs.The prosecution has been carrying out a series of probes into alleged misdeeds involving past government officials, which the conservative opposition parties have labeled \"political retribution.\" It will soon summon Woo and other NIS officials for handling a media blacklist -- a list of people critical of the then-conservative government to be shunned from government support.(Yonhap)","61":"The main opposition Liberty Korea Party decided Friday to expel corruption-tainted former President Park Geun-hye as part of reform efforts to regain public support and forge unity in the fractured conservative bloc.The decision came about a fortnight after the LKP ethics committee agreed to recommend she voluntarily leave the party.

Denying all accusations, Park has called the trial \"political retribution in the name of the rule of law.\"The Bareun Party is now on the verge of a split, as Park's removal from the LKP could encourage some of its members to defect.

Security Council unanimously adopted two sanctions resolutions against Pyongyang after its two long-range missile tests in July and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September.They aim to starve the regime of the financial and energy resources it needs to develop its weapons programs.The sanctions' effectiveness will largely hinge on cooperation from China, which is responsible for 90 percent of North Korea's external trade and the regime's only major ally.The White House has said Trump will seek to secure China's commitments to exert more pressure on the North when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing later next week.McMaster said he welcomes this week's announcement that Seoul and Beijing have agreed to move forward despite a dispute over South Korea's hosting of the THAAD US missile defense system on its soil.\"What's important is that China is no longer punishing South Korea for defending itself, which I always thought didn't make any sense,\" he said, referring to Beijing's economic retaliation against Seoul.\"What China may be realizing as well is that it makes more sense, at least from our perspective, to prioritize its relationship with South Korea over its relationship with North Korea, which is not only a dangerous state but a failing state at the same time.\"If North Korea continues to pursue nuclear weapons, McMaster said there could be a breakdown of the nonproliferation regime in Northeast Asia.\"And that's not in anybody's interest, right?\" he said, apparently addressing growing calls in South Korea and Japan for their own nuclear armament.Trump's 12-day swing through Asia will also include stops in Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be his first presidential trip to the region.

McMaster, national security adviser to President Donald Trump, said the regime appeared to fit the criteria for designation following its alleged murder of leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother early this year.\"That is an option that's under consideration. And so the president's Cabinet is looking at this as part of the overall strategy on North Korea,\" he said during a White House press briefing that previewed Trump's upcoming trip to Asia.

McMaster gestures as he answers questions from members of the media during the daily briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017. (AP Photo)\"A regime who murders someone in a public airport using nerve agent, and a despotic leader who murders his brother in that manner, I mean, that's clearly an act of terrorism that fits in with a range of other actions,\" he added. \"So this is something that's under consideration. And you'll hear more about that soon, I think.\"Under a law enacted Aug. 2, the State Department had 90 days to determine whether North Korea should be relisted. That deadline fell around Thursday.The communist regime was put on the list in 1988 for an airliner bombing that killed all 115 people aboard. In 2008, it was taken off in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.The US left North Korea off its latest list of state sponsors of terrorism in July.State sponsors of terrorism face restrictions on US foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and financial and other sanctions. But relisting North Korea is largely seen as symbolic because it is already under extensive sanctions for its nuclear and missile programs.\"Though North Korea is under a set of UN sanctions, Washington's possible redesignation is expected to have a symbolic impact as the move would mean tougher pressure,\" Lee Eugene, vice spokesperson at Seoul's unification ministry, told a press briefing Friday.

Since President Ronald Regan, all US presidents visiting South Korea have been to the DMZ, except for one -- President George H.W. Bush. During the state visit, President Trump will stress the importance of the Korea-US alliance and call for cooperative efforts from international leaders to press North Korea to drop its nuclear arms development, the senior official said. President Trump\u2019s first stop will be US military base Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, the official said. \u201cNo president has visited Camp Humphreys and we thought that that made more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there,\u201d he explained. It would also highlight Seoul\u2019s role in sharing the burden of the alliance, the official added. Camp Humphreys is the US military\u2019s latest installation in South Korea. More than 16 trillion won ($14.3 billion) has been injected into the installation so far, with South Korea shouldering more than half of the cost. After visiting the military base here, the US leader will then move to attend the bilateral talks and a dinner meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It will be the third one-on-one meeting between the two leaders.They are also expected to discuss items related to the free trade agreement, as the two sides are in the process of modifying the deal.In the scheduled parliamentary address on the second day of the visit, President Trump is expected to mention issues surrounding North Korea, the alliance with South Korea and his policy vision for Northeast Asia. His address will be the first since then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s speech at the National Assembly here in 1993.

Shin was also accused of transferring his shares in Japan-based Lotte Holdings to family members at face value to help the recipients evade about 70 billion won in gift taxes. He was also charged with breach of trust for inflicting losses by giving his mistress the right to run concessions at Lotte Cinema movie theaters.\"Considering his status and role in this crime and the scale of profits he gained directly or via family members, a stern criminal punishment is inevitable for him, even in light of his (advanced) age and health conditions,\" prosecutors said.Prosecutors also said Shin conspired with his son and Lotte Chairman Shin Dong-bin for the crimes.

The lawyer called for leniency, asking the court to allow the aged Shin to exit from the business quietly without his patriotism and management philosophy getting tainted.Shin, sitting in a wheelchair, said in his final statement that it's a matter of course to pay his family members' wages because they worked for the company.\u00a0 Last week, prosecutors also demanded 10 years in prison for his son and Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, a five-year term for his other son Shin Dong-joo, and seven years each for his daughter Shin Young-ja and his mistress Seo Mi-kyung over similar charges.These irregularities came to light during a fight between Shin's two sons for control of the group.

Seoul and Washington have claimed that it is intended solely to counter Pyongyang's threats. A strengthened US missile defense shield has long been anathema to China, as it could temper its offensive military capabilities against potential adversaries, particularly when it is pushing to enhance its off-shore power projection capabilities.\"The Moon Jae-in administration had hastily engaged in humiliating negotiations as it was obsessed with arranging a Seoul-Beijing summit,\" Khang Hyo-shang, the spokesman of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, told reporters.\"It is deplorable that in the agreement, there were only traces that indicate Seoul was being dragged by Beijing in the spat over the THAAD issue...

The endorsement in September of the ordinance by the State Council, China's Cabinet, is aimed at strengthening controls to \"eradicate extremism.\"Under the ordinance, organizers of unapproved religious activities in China will face fines of up to 300,000 yuan ($46,000) and anybody providing a venue for \"illegal religious events\" will face fines of between 20,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan.

It was five months into the Korean War when US troops crossed the 38th parallel, marched toward North Korea and clashed with the Chinese troops coming to the rescue of their communist ally.\u00a0 The war continued for about three years, costing the lives of 36,000 American troops and more than a quarter of a million Chinese troops. The Korean War came to an end when the two sides agreed to an armistice. South Korea opposed the peace talks and refused to sign the armistice agreement.\u00a0 With North Korea\u2019s relentless pursuit of a nuclear weapons program raising fear of another major armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula, the two powers appear to be bracing for a possible contingency, but this time the focus is on how to work together in the event of a sudden collapse of the North Korean regime.\u00a0 US State Secretary Rex Tillerson. YonhapUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently offered a glimpse into the secret contingency plan. He revealed that the Trump administration had assured China\u2019s leadership that if US forces crossed into North Korea to seize nuclear weapons, the troops would do their work and then retreat to the South. \u201cWe have had conversations that if something happened and we had to go across a line, we have given the Chinese assurances we would go back and retreat back to the south of the 38th parallel,\u201d Tillerson said in remarks at the Atlantic Council on Dec. 12.The South Korea-US wartime scheme, Operations Plan 5015, includes military campaigns to address North Korea\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. The plan calls for the allies\u2019 Special Forces to penetrate into North Korean territory to secure its nuclear weapons before they became operational.  OPLAN 5015, whose operational details are classified, reportedly does not spell out exactly who would control the North Korean territory after the mission is completed in a situation where the Chinese troops would most likely march into the North.\u00a0 Hence, Tillerson\u2019s discussion on contingency plans with the Chinese government is causing jitters among South Korean policymakers and military planners, experts said, rekindling deep-rooted worries that the two superpowers might determine Korea\u2019s fate once again. \u201cWe believe it is inappropriate for us to discuss or assess the remarks by the US secretary of state,\u201d Choi Hyun-soo, a spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense, said in response to a question about whether the South Korean military had consulted with the US government on the matter. South Korea\u2019s Constitution declares North Korea a part of its territory that needs to be reclaimed eventually, but most analysts doubt whether such a position would be recognized by the international community and neighboring countries, who view North Korea as a sovereign state.\u00a0 Some experts said that Tillerson\u2019s idea is part of a \u201cgrand deal\u201d between the US and China, which involves a scenario where the US may cede North Korean territory to the Chinese military if they help the US remove North Korea\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. In his column on the Wall Street Journal in August, Henry Kissinger said that \u201cunderstanding\u201d between Washington and Beijing is a prerequisite to resolving the nuclear standoff. Before the publication of the article, he had reportedly suggested to Tillerson that the US could make a pledge to Beijing that it would withdraw its troops from South Korea after the collapse of North Korea. \u201cMy impression is that the US appears to be floating the idea of a grand bargain by Kissinger to the Chinese government,\u201d said Yun Duk-min, former chancellor of the Seoul-based security think tank Korea National Diplomatic Academy. There is no indication that China has responded to Tillerson\u2019s proposal, or that military officials have met to discuss the idea, a taboo subject for Beijing, which has refused to discuss the idea out of concern that it would worsen the already tense relationship with North KoreaHowever, calls for developing contingency plans appear to be gaining ground among Chinese security and military experts, as they have publicly urged the country to prepare for any eventuality amid growing frustration with its wayward ally\u2019s relentless nuclear ambition.\u00a0\u00a0 Retired Chinese Army Lt. Gen. Wang Hongguang called for mobilizing troops along the border with North Korea to prevent conflicts in the region, warning that a war could break out on the Korean Peninsula at \u201cany time,\u201d even within the next several months.\u201cChina should be psychologically prepared for a potential Korean war, and the northeast China regions should be mobilized for that. \u2026 Such mobilization is not to launch a war, but for defensive purposes,\u201d Wang told an annual forum hosted by the Chinese Global Times newspaper Saturday.A South Korean newspaper reported Monday that China last year conducted a simulated military drill aimed at taking control of nuclear facilities similar to the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. China\u2019s Defense Ministry has yet to issue any public statements.\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report, saying it is not a matter that the South Korean government can discuss, while highlighting that the government is preparing for \u201cvarious eventualities\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. China has also been quietly building a network of refugee camps along its border with North Korea -- at least five in Jilin province -- as it braces for a human exodus in the event of the regime\u2019s sudden collapse, according to a leaked internal document from a state-run telecoms giant China Mobile.David Straub, a former US diplomat, said China has shown more willingness to discuss a possible contingency in North Korea, though the issue is still too sensitive for Beijing to raise first. \u201cIt seems pretty clear that the Chinese security experts and analysts are becoming more concerned that there might be a real possibility of unexpected developments,\u201d said Straub, a Sejong-LS fellow at the Sejong Institute. \u201cIn the past, the Chinese were reluctant even to listen to Americans talking about the conditions. Now I think the Chinese are quite happy to listen to what the Americans have to say and probably take careful notes. ... But I am still skeptical they have volunteered much to the US,\u201d said Straub.

The L42 resolution stresses that the UN Security Council-proposed resolutions should be properly carried out and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should be done through a peaceful way.\u00a0South Korea abstained from the voting of the L35 and L19 resolutions, but endorsed the L42 resolution, a government official said on the condition of anonymity.\"(The L35) is about the total elimination of nuclear weapons, but it also emphasizes damage of a certain country (Japan), so we decided there is a problem,\" the official said, adding that its decision also considers the treatment of South Koreans who were exposed to radiation.The official said the government decided not to vote on the L19 resolution following the country's security concerns as it calls for the immediate disuse of nuclear weapons, which apparently doesn't go along with the U.S.'s assurance of the American nuclear umbrella on the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea, however, favored the L42 resolution, the official said, since the country is one of the co-sponsors of the motion.

And he said the U.S. will never accept a nuclear North. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He added that regardless of what the North might try, it is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,'' he said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on \"a new urgency.''\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As he emphasized throughout his weeklong Asia trip, which included stops in Thailand and the Philippines, Mattis said diplomacy remains the preferred way to deal with the North.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"With that said,'' he added, \"make no mistake.\u00a0any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming.''

In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with ``fire and fury like the world has never seen.''\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Song, the South Korean minister, told the news conference that he and Mattis agreed that limits on South Korea conventional missile warhead payloads would be lifted. He offered no specifics. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also discussed were the conditions under which South Korea would be given wartime operational control of its forces. Currently, if war with the North broke out, the South's forces would operate under the U.S.-led U.N. Command. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn't budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Trump sticks to his pledge to stop the North from being able to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear attack, something will have to give - either a negotiated tempering of the North's ambitions or a U.S. acceptance of the North as a nuclear power.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The other alternative would be U.S. military action to attempt to neutralize or eliminate the North's nuclear assets - a move fraught with risk for South Korea, Japan and the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At his Seoul news conference, Mattis said the North is, in effect, shooting itself in the foot.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs, it will be counterproductive, in effect reducing its security,'' he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The North says it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was Mattis's second visit to South Korea since taking office in January. He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Friday he visited the Demilitarized Zone that forms an official buffer between the two Koreas. He appeared there with Song in what they both called a show of solidarity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 U.S. government officials for decades have confidently but mistakenly predicted the approaching collapse of North Korea, given its economic and political isolation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Twenty years ago, Mattis's predecessor five times removed, William Cohen, said as he peered into North Korea from inside the DMZ that its communist system was ``decaying and dying.'' His view was widely shared in Washington, but, like others, he underestimated the resilience of Pyongyang's family dynasty, which began with Kim Il Sung. The current ruler assumed control of the country shortly after his father, Kim Jong-Il, died in December 2011, and has accelerated the country's nuclear and missile programs.

The post has been vacant since former Chief Justice Park Han-chul retired in January.\u201c(Lee) has served the role of Constitutional Court justice faithfully, defending the basic rights of the people and the Constitution,\u201d Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun said, saying that Lee has consistently ruled to protect the weak, and to protect the people\u2019s rights from those in power. \u201cLee is second in seniority after Justice Kim Yi-su, and has ample administrative experience, making him the right man to lead the Constitutional Court.\u201d Lee passed the national bar exam in 1977, and held key posts including the post of chief of the Gwangju High Court, and served as the chief of Seoul Central District Court, before joining the Constitutional Court in 2012. Lee\u2018s nomination apparently comes as a surprise to many as the presidential office earlier cited a need to address the issue over the term of a new court chief.Cheong Wa Dae earlier insisted a new chief justice should receive another six-year term following his or her appointment, while the opposition parties argued the new court chief should only serve the remainder of his or her original six-year term as a justice. Only a Constitutional Court justice can be appointed the chief justice under the current law.Lee has been a Constitutional Court justice since 2012 and was set to step down as a justice in September 2018. A new chief justice must undergo a confirmation hearing by the parliament and also win parliamentary approval for appointment.Lee\u2019s nomination comes just over a week since Moon nominated Gwangju High Court chief Yoo Nam-seok as a Constitutional Court justice.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party on Friday had refused to open Yoo\u2019s confirmation hearing, arguing that the president must nominate a leader for the Constitutional Court.

(Yonhap)\u201cIf the North launches the missile on a standard trajectory and its re-entry technology is confirmed, there is a high possibility that North Korea will seek disarmament talks with the US on its proclaimed nuclear state status,\u201d the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security said in its 2018 forecast. According to IFANS, there is a high probability that the North will launch at least one \u201cHwasong-15\u201d ICBM in 2018, which scientists and experts say puts the US mainland well within its target range. On Nov. 29, North Korea fired what it claimed to be the latest version of its ICBM at a lofted angle. Experts said it could fly more than 13,000 kilometers if launched at a range maximizing trajectory. Pyongyang\u2018s negotiations framework could be difficult to accept for both the US and South Korea, it noted, but the allies would not be able to easily turn away from dialogue. North Korea has said it is willing to come to the dialogue table if the US recognizes it as a full-fledged nuclear weapons state. The US State Department has reiterated denuclearization as a mandatory precondition for talks. Despite growing concerns over North Korea\u2019s fast-developing weapons program, the Seoul-based think tank also pointed out that the isolated regime still faces limits in securing atmospheric re-entry technology for its missile.As an ICBM re-enters the atmosphere and falls at a top speed of Mach 24, it must survive temperatures of 6,000-7,000 degrees Celsius.If North Korea fails to prove its re-entry technology, the diplomatic confrontation that played throughout this year is likely to continue, the report said. On the chances of a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, the think tank said the overall probability is low, but the risk of an accidental war lurks beneath the heightened tensions. \u201cMinor military conflicts near the border may spiral into a full-blown war under the current heightened military tensions between the South and the North,\u201d it said.

(Yonhap)Standing several meters away from the North, he stressed his DMZ visit highlights the \"stark difference\" between the two Koreas.The North is ridden with an \"oppressive regime\" that shackles its people, while the South boasts a vibrant, thriving democracy and free society, he pointed out.He recalled a meeting with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo in Clark, the Philippines, on the sidelines of an ASEAN security forum earlier this week. \"Two days ago at the ASEAN meeting we made clear our mutual commitment to a diplomatic solution to address North Korea's reckless, outlaw behavior,\" Mattis said.Reading out his own statement next to Mattis, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo emphasized that the North's nuke and ballistic missiles are \"weapons that can't be used.\"\"If it does, it will face retaliation by the strong combined force of South Korea and the US,\" he said.The minister said he and the secretary are here together to confirm the ironclad alliance \"without a single inch of error.\"He called on Pyongyang to return to inter-Korean dialogue as early as possible. Song said Panmunjom was once a venue for talks between the two Koreas and armistice negotiations that effectively ended the\\ 1950-53 Korean War.\"But now, all dialogue is in a state of being severed,\" he added.Their DMZ visit came on the eve of the allies' annual defense ministerial Security Consultative Meeting in Seoul.It comes amid more than a month of let-up in the North's provocative acts following a series of missile launches and a nuclear test.There's speculation that Pyongyang and Washington are in secret contact to explore dialogue.Mattis arrived in South Korea earlier in the day. Shortly after landing at Camp Bonifas by Black Hawk chopper, he and Song headed to the OP Ouellette, a hilltop border post, and looked around a bunker underneath the facilities only 25 meters away from the North's territory.They were briefed on Panmunjom by US Army Col. Steve Lee, secretary of the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission. They then toured the UNCMAC's blue-colored conference building which stands on the Military Demarcation Line.The North's guards closely monitored the ministers' activities, with a group of tourists looking down from the Panmungak building in the North.In their Clark talks, the South's minister proposed Mattis, a former Marine Corps general, wear a combat uniform for the DMZ trip to send a highly symbolic message to the North. Mattis responded positively to the offer at that time, according to Song.But Mattis was dressed in a suit as usual after internal consultations apparently in order to avoid possible controversy over a dress code reflecting the US defense secretary's public availability.Asked whether President Donald Trump can travel to the DMZ when he visits South Korea early next month, Mattis was guarded.Following the DMZ tour, he paid a courtesy call on President Moon Jae-in at Cheong Wa Dae and met with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha.

The investigators are also looking into allegations that Oh Hyun-deuk privately used Kukkiwon funds on a business trip.\"We think that there's no problem (in our hiring process), but will watch how the investigation turns out,\" an official with Kukkiwon said. \"We believe donations to lawmakers were done of employees' own volition.\"\u00a0(Yonhap)","118":"South Korea's human rights watchdog recommended Thursday that military law enforcement hand down tougher punishment for sex crimes involving commanding officers and their female subordinates, amid growing concern over a rise in sexual assault cases in the barracks. The recommendation by the National Human Rights Commission to the Ministry of National Defense came based on its research into the military prosecution's handling of recent sexual assault cases regarding superiors and lower-level officers, the watchdog said. The survey began in May following the suicide of a Navy lieutenant who was raped by her commanding officer.\u00a0\u00a0 Kim Seong-joon, the head of the investigation unit at the National Human Rights Commission, speaks during a press briefing on Dec. 21, 2017, on its recommendation to the defense ministry calling for tougher punishment for assailants in the sexual assault cases in the military. (Yonhap)The NHRC has found that 80 percent of sexual assault victims between 2014 and 2016 were sergeants due to be examined by their superiors for extension of service. It alludes to the fact that they are in a vulnerable position in terms of resisting their boss even if they are sexually mistreated, the watchdog noted. The analysis also revealed that the military prosecution has tended to be lenient on the charges they press against the offenders. Some of them were indicted under the Criminal Law, or the law related to banning sexual violence, instead of the Military Criminal Law subject to aggravated punishment. One non-commissioned officer in his 40s was charged for sexually harassing a female subordinate in her early 20s under the general criminal law and is still on the job as he received a pecuniary penalty.In a separate case, the military court meted out a suspended sentence for an officer who groped a young female commissioned officer on her thigh, upholding the defendant's claim that he was intoxicated and made a mistake. The ratio of military court rulings of suspended sentences for sexual offenders came in at 10.34 percent, much higher than 1.36 percent by general district courts. The watchdog also called for stricter disciplinary measures against a sexual assailant, including an immediate opening of the reprimand process and collaboration with outside experts for a more thorough and independent review once an allegation is raised.

(Yonhap)\u201cWe will proceed with the excavation as carefully as possible and not damage even a scrap of thread,\u201d the civic group said at a press briefing. The May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement was a pro-democracy movement in which more than 200,000 Gwangju citizens took to the streets against the military dictatorship of Chun, an army general who came to power through a military coup in late 1979. Hundreds were killed and wounded there as the regime raged the most violent crackdown in the nation\u2019s modern history.The protest was later officially recognized as a grassroots rebellion against the dictatorship. Since then, efforts have been made to find the missing, which the local government officially announced amounts to 82.The investigation comes eight years after the last excavation in 2009. The government had run three excavation investigations from 2002 to 2009, after receiving some 64 reports from the public since 1998. But its dig-up of nine sites had failed to find any missing bodies. About the secret burial of the bodies of the victims in the prison site, the military at the time had said 28 died there. But only 11 bodies have been collected. The site had been selected following testimonies and reports that pointed to the area as a secret burial site of missing victims, it added. A commander had testified to the prosecution last month that they had buried 12 bodies on May 23 that year and that three of the victims were killed as they were forcefully taken to the prison.A noncommissioned officer and a citizen protestor who had also been in the jail reported on what they saw. Based on the information, the excavation team will look into an around 117-meter stretch of land in the area and will use devices such as ground penetrating radar to detect bodies, the civic group explained. If the team finds a body, it will run gene analysis tests to verify the identity and match them with the blood samples of bereaved families stored in the forensic studies department of Chonnam National University in the region.During the press briefing, a special committee investigating the democratic uprising established at the Defense Ministry also announced that they had found evidence supporting that the government at the time had fabricated related facts about the incident. \u201cWe have found out that the Chun administration had created committees and teams such as the \u201880 Committee\u2019 in 1985 as a countermeasure structure after the incident,\u201d the committee said. \u201cThe members constituting the committees were from government bodies such as the National Security Agency, closely aiding the leader.\u201d It explained that President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded the administration in 1988, had also created similar government institutes. The special committee said it would look further into the allegations.

The Chinese ban on Korea-bound tour package sales and security concerns over North Korea\u2019s provocations are considered the biggest reasons behind the continued fall in tourist visits.The data released by Korea Tourism Organization showed that 1,078,653 visitors from overseas traveled to Korea in September, which is 29.2 percent lower than the figure from the same period last year. The decrease in the total number of visitors is largely driven by a 56.1 percent fall in the number of Chinese travelers last month compared with the same period last year. The number of Chinse tourists stood at 318,682 last month, accounting for roughly one-third of total overseas tourists during the cited period.The number of Chinese tourists in Korea has seen a sharp decrease since March this year when Beijing ordered its travel agencies to stop selling Korea-bound tour packages.The number of tourists from the Philippines, Indonesia and India also went down last month by 37 percent, 33.6 percent and 53.7 percent, respectively, possibly due to the heightened security concerns following recent provocations from North Korea, according to the KTO.Tourists from Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan saw a slight increase of 5.4 percent, 6.7 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, from same period last year.

The announcement came just as Cheong Wa Dae denied reports that issues regarding the Constitutional Court president and the vacant justice position would be decided in tandem with the Constitutional Court Act revision pending at the National Assembly.\u00a0 Constitutional Court in Seoul on Wednesday (Yonhap)\u201cYoo spent four years at the Constitutional Court working as a researcher of the Constitution, and as a senior researcher, he is well versed in constitutional rulings,\u201d Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun said.\u00a0\u201cYoo is highly praised for his character and professional capabilities, and he has been nominated as a Supreme Court justice and for Constitutional Court justice.\u201dRegarding the timing of Yoo\u2019s nomination, Park said that Yoo had been reviewed according to protocol.\u00a0Ahead of Yoo\u2019s nomination, the presidential office refuted reports that a Constitutional Court president nominee would be named once the National Assembly approved proposed revisions to the Constitutional Court Act. Cheong Wa Dae also denied reports that President Moon planned to hold a meeting Wednesday with his aides to make a decision on the matter by the end of the day.\u00a0 Gwangju High Court chief Yoo Nam-seok. (Yonhap)Speaking to reporters Wednesday, a Cheong Wa Dae official said that no such meeting would be held and that the presidential office had not set any conditions for a nomination. \u201cWe have never said the National Assembly legislating (the proposed revisions) is the precondition for appointing an additional constitutional justice and for nomination of Constitutional Court president,\u201d the official said. The Constitutional Court consists of nine justices when fully staffed. The court\u2019s chief is nominated by the president from among the justices, who is then required to undergo a parliamentary confirmation hearing. A revision to the Constitutional Court Act stating that the chief of the court has a six-year term that begins at the time of inauguration is pending the National Assembly\u2019s approval. Current regulations do not define the duration of the Constitutional Court president\u2019s term, but state that the term of a justice of the court is six years. Since Constitutional Court Justice Kim Yi-su, who is the acting Constitutional Court chief, was rejected by opposition parties, speculation has grown that Moon would make his new nomination after the regulations are revised. Some also speculated that the Constitutional Court may remain under the leadership of the acting chief until the end of Kim\u2019s term in September next year. While Moon weighs his options, calls for him to make a new nomination have been growing from the political arena, as well as the Constitutional Court. In addition to opposition parties, the eight constitutional justices including Kim held a meeting and urged the president to name a new candidate for the post. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, however, remains firm on its position that the president should name a constitutional judge, who will go on to hold the post of the Constitutional Court president. However, the president appears unlikely to take the route suggested by the opposition.A Cheong Wa Dae official on Wednesday told the media that nominating the Constitutional Court chief is a power given to the president under the Constitution. Saying that the method would significantly narrow down the pool, the official said that the president is not required to accept the suggestion.(cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","136":"Ahn Cheol-soo, chairman of the minor centrist People\u2019s Party, on Wednesday accused President Moon Jae-in and his office of incompetence and missing the beat in Seoul-Washington relations. Speaking at a party meeting on Wednesday, Ahn said US President Donald Trump\u2019s Asian tour itinerary reflects South Korea\u2019s lack of status. People`s Party chief Ahn Cheol-soo speaks at a party meeting in Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap\u201c(Trump) stays in Japan for three days, but his stay in South Korea, the country directly involved in Korean Peninsula issues that are an urgent global issue, is short,\u201d Ahn said. Trump is set to begin his tour of five Asian nations \u2013 South Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines \u2013 early next month. The tour begins in Japan with the US president staying for three days from Nov. 5 to Nov. 7, and Trump will come to Seoul on Nov. 7, and leave the following day. Ahn added that the development was \u201cupsetting\u201d and said that the schedule reflects the status South Korea has, saying that the country had \u201clost face.\u201d\u201cIs a two-day state visit something that happens in a dignified country? Many negative side effects are expected in many areas,\u201d Ahn said. Saying announcements from Cheong Wa Dae and the White House regarding Trump\u2019s National Assembly address differed, Ahn went on to accuse the South Korean president of incompetence. \u201cPlease become competent. (I) only wish (for the president) to (serve his role) properly for the pride of our people.\u201d According to Ahn, Cheong Wa Dae stated that Trump is expected to talk about his Northeast Asia policies, and to talk of strengthening the South Korea-US alliance, while the White House statement read that the address will be about \u201cmaximum pressure on North Korea.\u201d The statement from the White House press secretary, however, says that Trump\u2019s address will touch on both subjects. \u201cThe president will speak at the National Assembly, where he will celebrate the enduring alliance and friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea, and call on the international community to join together in maximizing pressure on North Korea,\u201d the White House statement reads. While Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun\u2019s statement regarding the address mentions Trump\u2019s foreign policies, he also mentioned that the US president is expected to speak about the \u201cresponse to the North Korean nuclear issue.\u201d By Choi He-suk\u00a0(cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","137":"Seoul\u2019s Unification Minister said Wednesday that it is highly unlikely that North Korea will relinquish its nuclear weapons, as it nears the completion of its weapons program.\u201cThe possibility that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons is extremely low,\u201d Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said at a forum hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Seoul on Wednesday.\u00a0 (Yonhap)\u201cI used the term \u2018extremely low\u2019 to express it on a softer note. It would not be incorrect to say there is actually almost no chance that North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons because it views it as its lifeline,\u201d he added, indicating that Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program is not a mere bargaining chip for its leader Kim Jong-un. \u201cExperts expect (its nuclear weapons program to be completed) in two years. There is a possibility that (the North) might reach their goal next year.\u201dCho\u2019s statement comes amid the international community\u2019s mounting efforts to lure Pyongyang back to dialogue for denuclearization. On Sept. 3, North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test, which triggered a series of international sanctions aimed to cripple the rogue regime\u2019s economic and diplomatic power. It also sparked global concerns of the North drawing increasingly closer to becoming a full-fledged nuclear weapons state, as its state media claimed success in producing intercontinental ballistic missiles fitted with thermonuclear warheads. Closely following the test, South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister Song Young-moo said the military suspects the North may have secured technology to produce miniaturized nuclear warheads that weigh less than 500 kilograms. The weight of the warhead determines the missile range, which is considered a key to hitting the US mainland. The biggest challenge North Korea currently faces with its nuclear weapons program is believed to be securing stable re-entry technology, which allows a missile to survive the heat-intensive process of re-entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Pyongyang has been showing signs and expressing its will to continue its decadeslong nuclear ambition. North Korea would never agree to any sort of nuclear agreement with Washington, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told Russia\u2018s state-run media TASS earlier this month.\u201cNorth Korea has nearly achieved the final point on the way to our ultimate goal, to achieving a real balance of force with the United States,\u201d Ri told Tass. \u201cOur nuclear weapons will never be a subject matter of negotiations as long as the United States\u2019 policy of pressure on (North Korea) has not been uprooted once and for all.\u201d In September, Ri had previously told the media that a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific Ocean could be carried out.The North\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un has seemingly reduced public appearances by around a quarter so far this year, with half focused on military inspections and affairs, showed Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry data released Wednesday. According to the data, Kim attended a total of 75 inspections between Jan. 1 and Tuesday, which is a 24.2 percent decrease on-year. Military-related visits accounted for 49 percent of the total. To bring about North Korea\u2019s denuclearization, Cho said that is crucial to create an environment that could bring the regime to the dialogue table. \u201cAn economic approach (to create an environment for denuclearization) is necessary,\u201d he said.\u201cThis means an economic approach while upholding the United Nations Security Council Resolutions and working within its frame.\u201d The minister also said that the effect of the sanctions alone would be insufficient to push the North toward denuclearization, saying that Kim would not abandon the country\u2019s weapons program on the risk of a regime collapse. Cho\u2019s remarks echo those of Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that the sanctions against the North are \u201cuseless and ineffective,\u201d as North Korea would rather \u201ceat grass\u201d than give up its nuclear program \u201cif they don\u2019t feel safe.\u201dCho also ruled out the possibility of deploying tactical nuclear weapons and military options. The former could officially acknowledge the North as a nuclear weapons state, while the latter could bring about \u201ca devastating result.\u201dMeanwhile, a US think tank said Tuesday that North Korea\u2019s underground nuclear testing at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site is likely to continue, despite speculations that the site may no longer be suitable for such experiments.\u201cThe (recent series of) three earthquakes were likely induced by the 250 kiloton nuclear test,\u201d a report by 38 North, a blog run by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said. \u201cHowever, US nuclear test history at the Nevada Test Site provides evidence that such post-test tremors are not unusual. (With evidence of yet unused tunnel complexes) within the test site \u2026 there is no valid reason to assume that the Punggye-ri test site is unable to contain additional underground nuclear tests.\u201dBy Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)s","138":"The prosecution on Wednesday requested arrest warrants for three former senior officials of the National Intelligence Service as part of its probe into the spy agency's alleged political interference to help the two previous conservative administrations.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said that it sought the writs against Choo Myeong-ho, Shin Seung-gyun and Yoo Seong-ok, who led the NIS divisions of national intelligence, strategy and psychological warfare, respectively.The investigators accused them of breaching the NIS law banning intelligence officials' political involvement.

He also expressed hopes that the diplomacy would work before the regime grows its missile capability. \u201cThis year North Korea has conducted missile tests immediately after when there was progress on technology,\u201d said Koh Yoo-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. \u201cWhether the North would conduct further provocations depends on how the US and North Korea play their games.\u201dThe scheduled military exercise comes as the US has sent a batch of its strategic assets, including nuclear\u00a0submarine\u00a0USS Michigan, which arrived at the southern port of Busan on Friday.

It could also breach the latest UNsanctions barring the North's textile exports if the country seeks outbound shipments.The factory zone, launched in 2004, had accommodated 124 South Korean firms which employed more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods such as clothes and utensils.Touching on Seoul's plan on US$8 million aid to North Korea, Cho said that the government plans to implement it next year.The ministry last month approved the plan to provide humanitarian assistance to North Korea through UN agencies, but its timing for actual supply will be decided after taking various factors into consideration including inter-Korean ties.The move has sparked a row over whether it is proper for Seoul to offer aid to the North when the UN Security Council has stepped up pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.\"The government thinks that the issue of humanitarian aid should be handled separately from the political situation,\" Cho said.

His daughter is also in police custody for helping him dispose of the body. The police have referred Lee's case to the prosecution, on charges of murder, sexual molestation, indecent act by force and body abandonment. They also sent the daughter to be charged for enticement and body disposal.The investigation found that he told his daughter to invite the victim over as he needed someone to \"play\" his deceased wife, who committed suicide early last month, the Seoul Jungnang Police Station said at a press briefing. When the victim passed out after sipping a drink his daughter gave to her that contained sleeping pills, Lee stripped her and carried out lewd acts on her body, the police said.

His daughter has mostly likely been in a master-servant relationship with the suspect in which she blindly followed his unreasonable orders and took part in the crime, the police said.

According to the IPC official, who asked for anonymity, North Korea's Paralympic committee sent the document via e-mail on May 9. To take part in the Paralympic Games, athletes need to earn quotas for the quadrennial event by collecting good results in international competitions or receiving wild card slots by the IPC.Since North Korea is a relatively undeveloped country in disabled sports, its realistic scenario for participation will be earning wild cards from the IPC. For wild card consideration, North Korean athletes first need to be registered in the IPC database, and then wait to be classified based on their physical abilities. However, North Korea has yet to register any of its athletes in the IPC database. South Korean officials and the IPC are expected to discuss the North Korean participation issue next week.

In 2014, South Korea and the US agreed to postpone the wartime OPCON transfer until Seoul secures necessary operational capabilities. Although they did not fix a date, officials and experts estimated the transfer would not happen until at least the mid-2020s. However, some opposition lawmakers suspect that the timeline would be moved up a couple of years, suggesting that the allies\u2019 might complete the transfer before President Moon Jae-in finishes his five-year term in 2022. \u201cWe are going to take back wartime operational control in a prompt manner in accordance with the timeline and condition,\u201d Defense Minister Song Young-moo told lawmakers. \u201cIt would be a prime opportunity to dramatically improve our military.\u201d The minister added, \u201cthere will be no way\u201d for the US to conduct a pre-emptive strike against North Korea without consultation with South Korea.

The former leader has been detained since March 31.Whether the documents will lead to an extension of her arrest remains to be seen, but many have said fresh allegations may increase the possibility.The court is expected to reach a decision on Park's detention Friday. (Yonhap)The tragic sinking of the passenger ferry partly triggered the start of candlelight vigils late last year that eventually led to the ouster of Park in March.Many, including the bereaved families of the 304 people who were killed or went missing in the accident, demanded the former president to reveal her whereabouts on the day of the accident, claiming she may have failed to carry out her duty while being caught up in personal affairs.Cheong Wa Dae said the documents discovered at its crisis management office also indicated the National Security Council may have altered its manual on crisis management, possibly to remove any blame that might fall on the former president.Before what Im called an \"illegal\" revision of the manual, the NSC guideline cleared named the NSC as the top control tower in dealing with any major disaster or accident.The printed phrase was crossed out with a red pen in late July, apparently at an instruction from then NSC chief Kim Kwan-jin, Im said.A handwritten phrase was added in its place stating the NSC was to act as a control tower only in security-related incidents. The revised manual was then delivered all government offices, according to Im.Such a revision apparently came after then presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon testified before the National Assembly that Cheong Wa Dae or the NSC were not the control tower in dealing with the ferry sinking, Im noted.The incumbent presidential chief of staff also said such a revision to the NSC manual required legal procedures, including a review and approval by the Ministry of Government Legislation, but that the former administration took none of such steps.\"Cheong Wa Dae believes such an incident must never be repeated. Believing the incident represents the worst case of manipulation of power, the presidential office plans to request a formal investigation,\" Im said.

The Pentagon stressed a day later the classified scheme remains secure, though it declined to confirm whether there was a breach. However, concern continues to grow over the regime\u2019s evolving hacking technology and cyberwarfare capabilities. \u201cThere is cyberwarfare occurring between South Korea and North Korea every hour, every day,\u201d said Rep. Rhee Chul-hee of the ruling Democratic Party, who revealed the hacking incident, in an interview with local broadcaster CBS on Wednesday.North Korean residents gather at the statue of the North late leader Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il. YonhapAccording to the April report by the Korean Institute for National Unification, North Korea has been operating a total of 7,700 professional hackers, including those belonging to seven hacking organizations under the regime\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party and Korean People\u2019s Army. South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry has witnessed 4,000 hacking attempts over the past five years, with about 40 percent of them originating from China, which are suspected to be linked to North Korean hackers, said Rep. Park Joo-sun, a lawmaker of the People\u2019s Party. Seoul\u2019s central bank might have been targeted as well, lawmaker Rep. Shim Jae-cheol claimed, citing data that showed the Bank of Korea has seen an \u201cunusual surge\u201d in cyberattacks this year. Compared to 38 cyberattacks in 2015 and 44 in 2016, the number of hacking attacks this year stood at 116 in August. \u201cWith military tension reaching its peak following North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, North Korea would have conducted a series of cyberattacks targeting South Korea\u2019s central bank and financial institutions,\u201d Shim said. In recent years, North Korea has shifted its focus in cyberattacks. Not only has the North attempted to snatch classified military or government data to bring social disruption, it appeared to focus more on raising foreign currency under the chokehold of economic sanctions. A hacking group with ties to North Korea, Lazarus, was suspected of being linked to an $81 million cyber heist at the Bangladesh central bank in February 2016. The money was fraudulently transferred out of the bank\u2019s account at the New York Federal Reserve and moved to Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The communist regime has even appeared to rely on digital currency \u2013 such as Bitcoin -- as a means of evading tightening sanctions.\u00a0 South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency confirmed last month that North Korean hackers had sought to steal bitcoins from cryptocurrency exchanges here. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, the hackers targeted 25 South Korean employees at four different exchanges. \u201cBitcoin and cryptocurrency mining or activity involving cryptocurrency is a way for North Korea to generate funds and get around some of the sanctions,\u201d Priscilla Moriuchi, a director from Recorded Future, an intelligence research firm, said in an interview with Voice of America. \u201cWhat we have come to know over time is that they are sophisticated actors. They do have an in-depth understanding of internet networks and communication.\u201d Last month, Korean National Police arrested a group of South Korean and Chinese people for working with North Korean hackers to steal bank card information by hacking into automated teller machines.

(Yonhap)Also, the proposed delay requires a complete halt in North Korean provocations at least until the Winter Olympic Games, that will be held Feb. 9-25 with the Paralympic Games slated to be held March 9-18.\"It cannot but affect a decision (by the allies) should there be an additional provocation,\" he said.In his interview with the US broadcaster, the South Korean president said the decision depended entirely on North Korea.Some questions were raised about the possibility of delaying the annual military drills after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was not aware of any discussions between Seoul and Washington about plans to change the regular joint exercises.The Cheong Wa Dae official reaffirmed there have been discussions between the allies and that such discussions have been going on \"for some time.\"\"Secretary Tillerson deals with foreign relations while this is related to the military. I believe he may not directly be a part of such discussions,\" he said.The official later added the discussions on a possible delay of the military drills have been held between the countries' military authorities.The proposal to delay military drills also faced some criticism that it may weaken the South Korea-US alliance and possibly send a wrong message to the communist North, which staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, along with 11 long- and medium-range missile tests since the new South Korean leader took office in May.The Cheong Wa Dae official insisted the proposal was inevitable to make the upcoming event safe, or even to turn it into a chance to permanently reduce tension between the divided Koreas.\"Because the Olympics is an international event and the North Korean nuclear issue is creating a global crisis, it is only natural that we make efforts to find a solution (to the North Korean nuclear issue) through the Olympic Games if we must,\" the official told reporters.The official added his country still hoped to see North Korea take part in the quadrennial event but said its participation was not a prerequisite to the success or safety of the event.\"North Korea's participation in the Olympic Games is important for the success of the games, but it does not mean we cannot host the Olympic Games without it.\" (Yonhap)","170":"The education ministry under the former Park Geun-hye government undertook a mission to fix public opinion in favor of adopting the now-scrapped state-issued history textbooks, its internal probe team said Wednesday.

She highlighted their need, citing the \"left-leaning\" nature of existing versions that she said should be corrected. The adoption of the state-issued history books was considered one of her key policies that ended up earning little public support as it faced huge backlash from opponents and historians accusing her government of manipulating modern history in a way that glorified the dictatorial rule of ex-leader Park Chung-hee, her father. When President Moon Jae-in took office in May after Park's ouster over a corruption scandal, he scrapped the plan in the first month of his presidency.The probe team discovered the opinion statements in chunks, which were categorized as filled out by proponents. But the personal details of the respondents, such as names, addresses and phone numbers, were all fabricated. About 1,600 of them even used the same address.

Only 20 percent of them had been identified by the ministry. The leaked data included 295 classified documents, with 226 designated as \u201csecret,\u201d 42 as \u201cconfidential\u201d and 27 for \u201cofficial use only.\u201d More than 80 percent of 226 secrets were related to the allies\u2019 special warfare operation inside North Korea in the event of a war, according to Rhee. \u201cSome of the leaked documents include nonclassified military information about South Korea\u2019s missile defense operational concept, such as Kill-Chain,\u201d an aide from Rhee\u2019s office was quoted as saying by local daily Chosun Ilbo. Among the leaked documents about the decapitation plan were detailed procedures to monitor the movement of the North Korean leadership, contain their shelter and escape routes, conduct an air assault on facilities and destroy the leadership or secure their whereabouts. Earlier this month, Defense Minister Song Young-moo revealed a plan to establish a \u201cdecapitation unit\u201d by Dec. 1. Although specific task organization has remained confidential, analysts suspect it would be a brigade-level unit consisting of US-type special warfare forces. Meeting minutes about the joint military exercise Ulchi Freedom Guardian, military documents about the protection of military units and civilian structures, and even reports to the allies\u2019 senior commanders were also leaked, the lawmaker said.

(Yonhap)\"Ri's appointment appears aimed at preparing for potential high-level contact with the US and China,\" the report said. \"In particular, it seems to reflect the need to match the title of Chinese diplomatic counterparts.\"The move came amid an escalating war of words between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.Ri said in New York last month that his country could consider the detonation of a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean. The North's ruler vowed to take \"high-level\" retaliation against Washington after Trump threatened to \"totally destroy\" the North.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said that Ri's promotion appears to indicate an attempt by North Korea to break its deepening international isolation, which was sparked by the country's nuclear and missile programs.The WPK held the plenary meeting to conduct the personnel reshuffle days before the 72nd anniversary of its founding, which falls on Tuesday.Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North's leader, was named an alternate member of the party's politburo, the top decision-making body. The move appears intended to further tighten the Kim family's control over the country.The INSS said that Choe Ryong-hae, a close aide to leader Kim, may have taken the post of director of the WPK's organization and guidance department, which oversees the operation of party units and surveillance.He was also named as a member of the party's central military commission in the latest reshuffle.Meanwhile, Jong Kyong-thaek, who was newly picked as a member of the WPK's military commission, may have become the minister of state security, replacing spy chief Kim Won-hong, it said.Kim is known to have been dismissed in mid-January following the ruling party's probe into the spy agency. He reappeared at a military parade in April, but it was not confirmed whether he was reinstated, as state media did not mention his title.Pak Kwang-ho, an unknown North Korean official, may have replaced Kim Ki-nam, 91, director of the party's propaganda and agitation department, the report said.In a surprise move, Pak was given the triple titles of member of the political bureau, vice chairman of the WPK's central committee and director of a department at Saturday's meeting. His background and career are not known, as his name has barely appeared in state media reports so far.

We have yet to get answers from the North Koreans, but I'm sure they're giving it deep consideration.\"In his editorial published by the Washington Post on Oct. 4, Carter warned of another possible Korean war, and he wrote that the US should consider sending a \"high-level delegation\" to North Korea for peace talks. Park said Carter offered to help to current US President Donald Trump several times, but did not get a positive response. According to Park, Trump told Carter that North Korea issue should be handled by the current administration, not by a former president. Trump also reportedly told Carter to leave him alone, Park added. The Georgia University professor said Carter doesn't specifically want to be a special envoy, although visiting North Korea with such position can give him more authority. \"We still have to watch North Korea's reaction,\" he said. \"We might be able talk with Trump again if North Korea sends an official invitation.

A Latvia-Korea business forum to link the two countries\u2019 businesspeople is also in the works. A detailed schedule of the visit is yet to be finalized. Vejonis also expressed hope that the current military tension would be defused through diplomatic efforts. \u201cNuclear blackmailing is a problem for the whole world,\u201d he said, adding that Latvia, as part of the international community, will help pressure North Korea to turn to diplomacy and dialogue. As for the Olympics, the president said his country of 2 million is strong in winter sports and expects medals in at least four categories in Pyeongchang -- bobsleigh, skeleton, luge and biathlon. \u201cOne of the most important competitions for us is skeleton, where our Martins Dukurs will compete with Yoon Seong-bin (of South Korea),\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope they compete for the gold medal.\u201dPrior to taking presidency in July 2015, Vejonis was a defense minister, longtime member of the parliament and environmental minister.

From 2013 to 2016, the number of underage drug offenders has dropped from 506 to 56 while those involved in theft and physical violence have also decreased considerably.Experts attribute the rise in juvenile sex crimes to the overall ineffectiveness of the underage justice laws. Critics argue that the current system, centered mostly around probation monitoring and youth detention, is failing to register the notion with students that sexual assault is a grave crime.\"Concerned ministries must work hard to produce programs to prevent juvenile sex offenses, while it is also imperative for corrective authorities to come up with measures, such as establishing special units dedicated to handling juvenile delinquents,\" Baek said.

The reclusive regime may be eying the virtual currency as its transactions are difficult to trace, allowing Pyongyang to bypass international sanctions, experts here said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)\u201cIt is difficult to trace a bitcoin exchange if North Korea wants its financial transactions to remain in the dark,\u201d Lee Kyung-ho, a professor at Korea University\u2019s Graduate School of Information Security, told The Korea Herald. Pyongyang is suspected to have been involved in a recent series of hacking attempts targeting local cryptocurrency exchanges. In July, South Korea\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange platform, Bithumb, was hacked, which resulted in monetary losses worth some 7.6 billion won ($7 million). A recent report by Chosun Ilbo said the National Intelligence Service found evidence that North Korea was involved in the leaking of personal information from some 30,000 accounts from Bithumb. The evidence was passed on to prosecutors here for further investigation. Months prior to the Bithumb hacking, other Seoul-based bitcoin exchanges, such as Yapizon and Coinis, were also targeted in similar cyber thefts. Emails encrypted with malicious codes were sent to people in the bitcoin industry here to breach security systems, Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency\u2019s cybersecurity division said in July. On Tuesday Yapizon, now called YouBit, was shut down from the damage it received from another cyberheist. The platform reportedly lost an additional 17 percent of its cryptocurrencies from the hacking attack, which happened earlier in the day. Whether North Korean hackers were involved in the latest attack is unknown. Professor Lee added bitcoin\u2019s soaring value coupled with how it can smoothly \u201cmove across\u201d borders is the reason why the North is eyeing the market, amid international sanctions curbing the flow of foreign currency into the country. According to Lee, it was widely predicted under the current circumstances that bitcoin-related hackings would eventually emerge as a popular method for the North to secure foreign currency.\u201cThere are routes where a bitcoin can be exchanged for another form of cryptocurrency, which can make it hard for authorities to trace where each bitcoin came from and eventually ends up,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin is also relatively free from international sanctions including United Nations Security Council Resolutions because it is not an asset that governments can control or freeze. If a government imposes regulation on a certain cryptocurrency exchange, then its users can just move to another platform,\u201d explained Lee. One problem that the international community faces is that cyberattacks by North Korean hackers are growing more aggressive and bolder with time. The Donald Trump administration on Monday publically accused North Korea as being responsible for spreading WannaCry malware in May. In the WannaCry attack, more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries were locked down and those behind the attack demanded payment in bitcoin to free their systems. Several fell victim to the ploy, including British hospitals and global companies, such as FedEx and Nissan. South Korea has been keeping tabs on its wayward neighbor\u2019s online activities, aware of its growing reputation as a major hub for virtual currencies backed by its internet speed and wide broadband access -- which could increase the risk of falling under North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks at the same time. North Korea has been linked to \u201cvarious activities\u201d to dodge sanctions and earn foreign currency, the South Korean government said Tuesday, while acknowledging the rogue nation\u2019s latest bitcoin-related hacking attempts. \u201cThe government is monitoring (North Korea\u2019s) trends related to bitcoin,\u201d Baik Tae-hyun, spokesman for the Unification Ministry, said at a regular press briefing. Baik\u2019s remarks referred to a number of news reports shedding light on North Korea\u2019s alleged trading of cryptocurrency for goods along with recent bitcoin market hackings. \u201cWe are aware that North Korea has been engaged in various activities to evade sanctions and earn foreign currency,\u201d he added. According to California-based cybersecurity firm FireEye, the North is targeting the virtual currency market to avoid sanctions and fund Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, it said in a report released in September. It could be attempting to rake hard cash in exchange for stolen virtual coins, it added. Baik also said the South Korean government is seeking measures to curb North Korea\u2019s apparent illicit acts associated with digital currency, in cooperation with relevant authorities, including the state cybersecurity center. \u201cWe are continuing efforts to block North Korea\u2019s hacking attempts,\u201d he said. But the official did not confirm on whether the government has detected any solid evidence backing the North\u2019s actual involvement in the crimes. He also remained tight-lipped on whether the government holds data on the estimated amount of bitcoins the North possesses.The news of North Korea\u2019s latest bitcoin-related crimes come as the isolated nation is reportedly struggling under a series of United Nations Security Council sanctions drawn to cripple its economic growth.

The North Korean workers found in Chinese factories aren't allowed to leave, and receive only a fraction of their pay _ most goes straight to the North Korean state.

They have not testified but their defense has said the women believed they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and were tricked by men suspected of being North Korean agents.\u00a0On Wednesday, the judge and court officials wore face masks and surgical gloves as VX-tainted evidence was presented in court.\u00a0\u00a0 A pathologist said VX, its precursors and its byproducts were detected in Kim's eyes, on his face, in his blood and urine, and on his clothing. Mohamad Shah Mahmood testified that the fastest absorption would have been through the eye mucus and that once VX entered the bloodstream, ``there is a very slim chance of survival.''\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors and defense lawyers examined the VX-tainted samples, which were sealed in transparent plastic bags, during a court break. Most of them wore gloves and masks as a safety precaution, and later, Judge Azmi Ariffin also covered himself as the samples were officially admitted as evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors also Wednesday sought to show VX was the sole cause of death. Mohamad Shah testified that drugs used to treat diabetes, hypertension and gout were in Kim's blood, but those drugs and those conditions would not have caused his swift death. Earlier testimony showed Kim died within two hours of being attacked, not within 20 minutes as earlier stated by Malaysia's health ministry.\u00a0Gooi Soon Seng, defense lawyer for Aisyah, had disputed the VX findings on Wednesday, before the chemist testified a byproduct was found on his client's shirt.\u00a0\u00a0 VX is banned by an international treaty as a weapon of mass destruction but is believed to be part of North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal. Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea's dynastic rulers but was believed to have been cast out by his father and had lived abroad for years. He reportedly never met current leader Kim Jong Un, who is widely believed to have perceived his older sibling as a threat and targeted him for assassination.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial is being closely watched by the Indonesian and Vietnamese governments, which hired the defense lawyers for both women.

The relationship between the LKP and the ruling bloc has grown increasingly acrimonious as the latter has been pushing for its drive to \"eliminate accumulated ills,\" which the LKP argues is political retribution against former conservative governments.During the talks with party leaders, Moon rejected the notion that the drive was a political reprisal, stressing it was a process to remove the \"structure of unfairness and undue privileges\" embedded in the country's society.

The Bank of Korea in Seoul said North Korea\u2019s economic growth reached a 17-year high of 3.9 percent in 2016. The South Korean central bank has monitored the North Korean economy since 1991.\u00a0 North Korean staff stand behind the counter of the kitchenware booth of a distributor from Thailand at the 13th International Trade Fair in Pyongyang on Monday. (AFP-Yonhap)The figure is a rebound from 2015, when North Korea posted a negative growth of 1.1 percent mainly due to a severe drought that led to a drastic decrease in grain production.The North recorded 0.8 percent growth in 2011, 1.3 percent in 2012, 1.1 percent in 2013 and 1 percent in 2014, according to BOK data.Experts in Seoul attributed the North\u2019s relatively rapid growth last year to a revitalized black market and the increase in trade with China, Pyongyang\u2019s closest ally.\u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s move to bring some elements of capitalism including market economy into its socialist economic system has seemingly invigorated North Korea\u2019s economy because it has awoken its people to a new way of life,\u201d Yang Un-chul, vice president of the private Sejong Institute, told The Korea Herald. \u201cToday, North Korean citizens have a more capitalist mind. They have begun to brainstorm new ideas and think for themselves to generate more personal profit.\u201d Having taken power after the death of his father and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2011, the junior Kim is said to have been in favor of a more flexible economic system. This has since led to a growth in the North\u2019s private enterprises, according to experts here.They said the North\u2019s economic reform has also bestowed the business and factory operators more private control over its employees and management. The overall farming trend has also shifted from state-controlled to a more family-owned system.\u00a0 North Korean visitors leave the the 13th International Trade Fair in Pyongyang on Monday. (AFP-Yonhap)Another factor behind the economic growth concerns the North\u2019s trade ties with China, which reportedly account for nearly 90 percent of North Korean trade.According to data from the state-run Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, bilateral trade between Pyongyang and Beijing rose 6.1 percent in 2016 from a year earlier, reaching a two-way total of $6.5 billion. Notably, China\u2019s export of foreign goods such as chocolate and alcohol to North Korea rose in the first two quarters of this year, which indicates that its economy is not sluggish, said Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post last week. It said that North Korea imported about 167.9 tons of chocolate worth $398,000 from China during the first quarter of this year, which is 1.8 times more than the same period a year before. But experts forecast that the North\u2019s economy will be hit hard by the recent set of stronger economic sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council, which targets its textile exports. In 2016 alone, textiles were the North\u2019s second-biggest export item worth $752 million, after coal and other minerals. \u201cIts economy is likely to face more difficult challenges this year due to its latest series of nuclear and missile tests,\u201d Yang added.

YonhapReversing its initial assessment of a \u201csuspected explosion,\u201d China Earthquake Networks Center concluded that Saturday\u2019s earthquake was \u201cnot a nuclear test,\u201d adding that the incident had the characteristics of a natural earthquake. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also released a report saying the earthquake was likely a \u201clagged collapse earthquake,\u201d according to a report by AFP, echoing experts\u2019 assessment that the earthquake was a delayed repercussion of the previous detonation.In a tweet posted Saturday, Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, said the quake was \u201cunlikely man-made\u201d and looked similar to a \u201ccollapse\u201d event at North Korea\u2019s Sept. 6 nuclear test. North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test -- its sixth to date -- was detected as a 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Sept. 3 and was followed by a 4.1 magnitude quake that experts said could have been a tunnel collapsing after the nuclear explosion.\u201cThe most probable hypothesis at present is that this is a consequence of the previous event, which was of a significant magnitude and may still have repercussions in a fracture zone,\u201d Zerbo said in an interview with AFP. David Wright of the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists agreed the latest quakes did not appear to have been caused by a new nuclear explosion. \u201cIt seems likely that these small tremors are related to the shifts in the ground due to the recent large test,\u201d he told Reuters.The United States Geological Survey was neutral in its assessment of the cause of the tremor, saying in a statement that it could not \u201cconclusively confirm at this time\u201d whether the earthquake was a natural or human-made event.With North Korea and the US exchanging bellicose rhetoric over Pyongyang\u2019s relentless pursuit of its nuclear ambition, the world has braced itself for another show of force by the North, which threatened to carry out an atmospheric nuclear test.In comments to reporters in New York on Thursday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said his country\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un is considering whether to demonstrate his ability to detonate a nuclear warhead aboard a missile sent above the Pacific.

The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention revealed its interim result on the preliminary blood culture tests of the three premature babies, who died over less than a two-hour period while being treated at the intensive care unit of Ewha Womans University Medical Center in western Seoul on Saturday. The blood tests detected Citrobacter freundii, a type of gram-negative bacteria, which is commonly found in a healthy human gut as a beneficial strain but can often cause respiratory, blood-related or urinary symptoms for immunocompromised patients, including premature babies, the KCDCP said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)A gram-negative bacteria is also antibiotics-resistant, raising the possibility of overuse resulting in or contributing to their deaths, it added. On Monday, forensic doctors of the National Forensic Service carried out postmortem examinations on the bodies. It released a statement later that its preliminary assessment found no obvious cause of the deaths and anything certain can only be determined after conducting a detailed analysis through a microscope, which will take a few weeks. The KCDCP has said it is carrying out a DNA sequencing to determine if the bacteria has the same identity and its result will be available as early as this afternoon.\u00a0 The hospital has said its doctors in charge performed CPR on the babies when they showed signs of cardiac arrest. But the four died between 9:31 p.m. and 10:53 p.m. Families said the babies all had bloated bellies and difficulty breathing prior to the deaths. The incident has sent shock waves through the country, with police, the Seoul city government and the KCDCP having launched a full investigation to find out the exact cause of the deaths.

It will be the first Olympics in South Korea since the 1988 Seoul Summer Games.In mid-March, China banned the sale of group tours to Seoul in retaliation against the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in southeastern South Korea, which Beijing sees as a security threat.The move has sent the number of Chinese visitors to South Korea tumbling, hitting the local tourism industry hard. South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Lotte groups have taken a big hit in the wake of China's retaliation.Industry sources said the upcoming quadrennial sports showcase may improve the strained ties between economic powerhouses in Asia. During a summit in Berlin in July, South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to visit Seoul on the occasion of the Winter Games.\u00a0(Yonhap)Moon and Xi may \"make a decision\" to iron out the conflict over the missile defense system should the Chinese leader pay a visit to Seoul next year, they said.\"We hope that the PyeongChang Games will serve as a chance to eliminate negative factors for the South Korean economy, such as China's retaliation against South Korea over the THAAD deployment and North Korea's nuclear risk,\" an industry watcher said. \"South Korean companies' active marketing activities during the games will likely help tide over the crisis.\"China's retaliatory measures have dealt a harsh blow to South Korean companies. Hit hardest is retail giant Lotte Group that has invested more than 8 trillion won ($7.1b) in China.Lotte Group is now in negotiations with foreign companies to sell its discount store chain in China, having decided to withdraw from that market following Beijing's retaliation.About 80 percent of the 112 Lotte Mart stores in China have been closed for more than six months following a series of economic measures taken by China against Lotte's land-swap deal with the Seoul government to host the US missile defense system. Lotte Mart's damage is expected to reach 1 trillion won by the end of this year.\u00a0(Yonhap)Lotte exchanged its golf course in the southeastern county of Seongju, where the THAAD battery is now being installed, for a lot of land near the South Korean capital of Seoul.On the domestic market, Lotte's duty-free business has been floundering due to a tumble in the number of Chinese tourists.Lotte officials expected the upcoming Winter Olympics to come as an occasion for China to start relaxing its retaliatory measures.\"The PyeongChang Games will be a global sports festival, so we hope they will serve as an opportunity to resolve conflicts and misunderstandings between countries,\" said an official of Lotte, an official sponsor of the Olympics.Lotte is not alone.

Hyundai and Kia sold a combined 576,974 vehicles in the world's largest car market in the first eight months of this year, down a whopping 44.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.Concerns are growing that the combined sales of Hyundai and Kia may drop below the 7 million mark this year, retreating to a level posted six years earlier.Despite rising hopes, some watchers offer a pessimistic outlook, saying the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may not help ease China's retaliation dramatically. \"There are no signs of China lifting its retaliatory measures that have been in place for more than six months,\" an industry source said. \"It may take a long time for things to return to normal even if China decides to end its retaliation.\" (Yonhap)","228":"WASHINGTON -- The United States plans to keep pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, a senior US administration official said Monday in a preview of the new national security strategy.The strategy to be unveiled by President Donald Trump later in the day will focus on four pillars: protecting the homeland, promoting American prosperity, preserving peace through strength and advancing American influence.It is expected to address the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\"It's very important both to defend the US homeland against ballistic missiles from anywhere, especially from North Korea, which has been the most belligerent and destabilizing country of 2017,\" the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.

Trump also hopes to continue working with China to maintain that pressure and even increase it.The official also noted it would not be in the long-term interest of China, Russia or other nations if North Korea's regional neighbors decided to arm themselves with nuclear weapons to defend themselves.\"So, our strategy is to convince these countries that this is a threat to everybody.

Sales of liquefied natural gas are banned outright.\u00a0A North Korean solder stands guard near barrels stacked up near the river bank of the North Korean town of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong. China announced Saturday, Sept. 23, 2017 it will limit oil supplies to North Korea under UN sanctions starting Oct. 1, 2017, stepping up pressure on Pyongyang over its pursuit of nuclear and missile technology. (AP)North Korea depends on China for almost all its oil and gas but estimates of its consumption are low,leaving it unclear how Beijing\u2019s new limit will affect them. The restrictions announced Saturday do not apply to crude oil,which makes up the biggest share of energy exports to the North.China also will ban textile imports from the North, the ministry said. Textiles are believed to be the North\u2019s biggest source of foreign revenue following rounds of UN sanctions under which Beijing cut off purchases of coal, iron ore, seafood and other goods.China accounts for some 90 percent of the North\u2019s trade, making its cooperation critical to efforts to derail Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile development.Chinese leaders were long the North\u2019s diplomatic protectors but express increasing frustration with the government of Kim Jong-un. They support the latest UN Security Council sanctions but are reluctant to push Pyongyang too hard for fear Kim\u2019s government might collapse. They also argue against doing anything that might hurt ordinary North Koreans.Chinese officials complain their country bears the cost of enforcing sanctions, which have hurt businesses in its northeast that trade with the North.The UN Security Council voted Sept. 11 to limit fuel supplies and ban the North\u2019s textile exports. China, one of five permanent council members with power to veto U.N. action, agreed to the measure after the United States toned down a proposal for a complete oil embargo.Petroleum exports for use in the North\u2019s ballistic missile program or other activities banned by UN sanctions also are prohibited, the Commerce Ministry said.The US government\u2019s Energy Information Agency estimates the North\u2019s 2016 daily imports from China at 15,000 barrels of crude oil and 6,000 barrels of refined products. That would be the equivalent of almost 5.5 million barrels of crude and 2.2 million barrels of refined products for the full year.North Korea has abundant coal but depends almost entirely on imports for oil and gas.North Korean textile exports in 2016 totaled $750 million, according to South Korea\u2019s Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. It said nearly 80 percent went to China.

(Yonhap)Dragged down by such weak inbound traffic, the total number of foreigners who visited South Korea last month fell 33.7 percent on-year to 1.1 million from 1.6 million, according to the data.Chinese visitors accounted for nearly half of the 17 million foreigners that visited the country last year.The sharp decline in Chinese tourists has been widely expected as Beijing has banned its travel agencies from selling package tours bound to South Korea since mid-March in an apparent retaliation over Seoul's deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. The ban, which especially has wrecked havoc on South Korea's retail and duty-free companies, has yet to be lifted.The KTO said that while numbers have fallen, the rate of decline in Chinese visitors slowed last month from the 69.3 percent on-year drop reported in July. South Korea also saw the number of visitors from the Philippines and Indonesia plunge 38.1 percent and 44.5 percent on-year in August, respectively, according to the data.The drop from the two countries was mainly attributed to difficulty in securing flight tickets to South Korea amid a sharp increase in demand for flights to the two Southeast Asian countries here during the peak holiday season, the KTO said.The number of outbound South Korean nationals came to 2.38 million in August, up 15.6 percent from 2.06 million a year earlier, the data showed.

Choe Son-hui (L) (Yonhap)Earlier this month, North Korea carried out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test yet and test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, which resulted in an angry backlash from the rest of the world.In his address to the United Nations General Assembly earlier this week, US President Donald Trump threatened to \"totally destroy\" the North Korean regime, prompting North Korea to vow Friday to take the \"highest level\" action in response. The upcoming talks come in addition to a series of previous North Korea-Russia consultations.The Russian ambassador, serving as Russia's deputy nuclear negotiator, visited North Korea in late July to discuss issues involving the Korean Peninsula, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. On Monday, Choe met with Russian Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora in Pyongyang as part of the continued discussions. Russia has been unusually vocal in its call for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear issue amid a growing war of words between Pyongyang and Washington. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned during the ongoing UN assembly Thursday that an excessive military response to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests would lead to disaster.Earlier this month, American chief envoy on the North Korean issue Joseph Yun was invited to Russia to discuss the issue with his Russian counterpart there.

Donald Trump (AP-Yonhap)\"Our new executive order will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind,\" he said.The order enhances the Treasury Department's authority to target any individual or entity that conducts \"significant\" trade in goods, services or technology with the North.In particular, it allows sanctions to be placed on any foreign financial institution that \"knowingly conducts or facilitates any significant transaction\" on behalf of blacklisted individuals and entities or in connection with trade with North Korea.The sanctions could be restrictions on relevant accounts in the US or their complete blockage, according to a White House statement.The order also targets North Korea's shipping and trade networks by banning vessels and aircraft that have visited North Korea from visiting the US within 180 days. The ban also applies to vessels that have engaged in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that has visited North Korea within 180 days.\"North Korea is dependent on its shipping networks to facilitate international trade,\" the White House said.In addition, the order authorizes the Treasury Secretary to place sanctions on individuals involved in a range of industries in North Korea, including construction, energy, fishing and textiles; those involved in the ownership, control or operation of any port in the North; and others found to have had at least one \"significant\" trade transaction with North Korea in goods, services or technology.\"Foreign banks will face a clear choice: Do business with the United States or facilitate trade with the lawless regime in North Korea -- and they won't have so much trade,\" Trump said.North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, drawing fresh UN Security Council sanctions, including caps on its imports of oil.The Trump administration had pushed for a complete oil embargo but faced opposition from Russia and China, two of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the council.The announcement sends a clear signal to China, North Korea's major ally and trading partner. Beijing is responsible for 90 percent of the North's external trade and has come under growing pressure to rein in its wayward neighbor.Trump said China's central bank had just told the country's other banks to \"immediately\" stop doing business with North Korea, and thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for that \"very bold\" and \"unexpected\" decision.\"This new order provides us with powerful new tools, but I want to be clear the order targets only one country -- and that country is North Korea,\" he said. \"Many countries are working with us to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea.

The complaint comes a day after local tabloids ran stories about the only child of Kim Kwang-seok, Seo-yeon, who died in 2007 at the age of 16. Some of the reports speculated the death may not be accidental, as she was the legal inheritor of her father's estate, including copyrights to his music.Lee Sang-ho, a TV journalist and documentary film director, filed the complaint against Kim's widow, only identified by her surname Seo. He accused her of not informing Kim's family of her daughter's death while they were in a legal battle over the ownership of copyrights to his music and albums.\u00a0 This file photo, taken April 1, 2016, shows a picture of late folk rock singer Kim Kwang-seok at an exhibition held in commemoration of him and his music in Seoul. (Yonhap)Lee's lawyer declined to give further details on the complaint, only saying that it's related to the younger Kim's death being a possible homicide. Lee has also requested a ban on Seo leaving the country, the lawyer said.Police closed the daughter's case as accidental, based on the autopsy that concluded her death was caused by acute pneumonia, with no signs of external injuries. The top court ruled in 2008 the daughter holds the rights to the singer's estate. Seo became the legal inheritor of Kim's assets after their daughter died and now owns all the copyrights and neighboring copyrights to his music.The singer Kim committed suicide in 1996, when he was 32. His death sent shock waves through fans and the public, who loved his plaintive yet captivating vocals and sentimental lyrics that critics say portrayed individuals' sorrow and frustration at a time when the society was struggling in its early stage of democracy following rapid industrialization. The reporter, who has undertaken a probe of his own into Kim's death, has insisted Kim did not kill himself. He alleges Seo and her brother, who has a long rap sheet, were involved in the case.

It marked the resumption of aid after a hiatus of nearly two years.But Seoul said that it will later decide on the timing of an actual provision, apparently mindful of divided public opinion about assisting North Korea amid its provocations.\"The government will weigh the timing of an aid provision and size after taking into account various factors such as inter-Korean situations,\" the ministry said in a statement.\u00a0(Yonhap)The move came amid concerns that Seoul's aid may compromise international efforts to pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile programs.Whether or not to offer aid to Pyongyang is an issue sparking political repercussions in a country in which conservatives and liberals are sharply divided on how to deal with North Korea.The ministry said that the international community is sternly responding to North Korea's provocations, but also emphasizing the need to extend humanitarian assistance to North Koreans.\"The global community has shared its view about the need to separate aid from politics,\" Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said.Under the plan, the South will provide $4.5 million for a nutrition program run by the World Food Program.

No international terrorist incident has taken place so far for racial or religious issues,\" Moon said.\"Also, South Korea has vast experience and capacity (in hosting international events).

A rejection would deal a major blow to Moon, just a couple of weeks after his pick for Constitutional Court chief was voted down.Conservative parties have opposed Kim, taking issue with his previous role in leading a group of liberal judges, his 2015 ruling in favor of a progressive teachers\u2019 union and his perceived advocacy for homosexuals\u2018 rights. They claim his appointment could fuel the judiciary\u2019s swing to the left.On Wednesday, the ruling party chief pleaded for support for Kim.\u00a0Rep. Choo Mi-ae speaks during a party meeting on Sept. 20, 2017. (Yonhap)\u201cI welcome the agreement to open a plenary session to handle the motion for nominee Kim\u2018s appointment. It\u2019s fortunate that a vote will take place albeit belatedly,\u201d DP leader Choo Mi-ae said during a daily party meeting. \u201cIt\u2018s been confirmed through the confirmation hearing that nominee Kim is the right person for judicial reform and he is a judge of high morality and integrity,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point should be on whether he\u2019s the right person for judicial independence. I wholeheartedly plead for opposition support and cooperation.\u201dBut the main opposition Liberty Korea Party showed no signs of backing down from its opposition to Kim. It adopted disapproval as a party line.Rep. Chung Woo-taik, the party\u2018s floor leader, highlighted Kim\u2019s alleged advocacy for homosexuality, saying his appointment is feared to \u201crock the legal, religious values about same-sex marriage and homosexuality in our society.\u201d\u201cThere is no change in our position that nominee Kim is unfit for head of the judiciary,\u201d he said.Chung also emphasized that Kim hosted an academic seminar on homosexuality. Kim, if approved, could designate judges supportive of homosexuality to be Constitutional Court justices. Under law, the Supreme Court\u2018s chief is supposed to name three of the Constitutional Court\u2019s nine justices.That could lead to the Constitutional Court finding the military law banning homosexuality unconstitutional, he said.The minor opposition People\u2018s Party is considered holding a casting vote in the showdown, just as it did in the parliamentary rejection of the Constitutional Court\u2019s chief last week. The party has 40 seats in the 299-member parliament while the ruling party has 121 seats and the main opposition party has 107 seats.Hours before the vote on Kim Thursday, the ruling party leader will meet with Ahn Cheol-soo, the chief of the People\u2018s Party, in a last-ditch effort to secure his backing, multiple sources said.President Moon already called Kim Dong-cheol, the minor party\u2019s floor leader, to ask for cooperation, before departing for New York on Monday to attend the UN General Assembly, sources said.The minor party had threatened to reject the nominee after Choo slammed the party for joining the main opposition party in rejecting the Constitutional Court nominee. Earlier this week, Choo apologized for the criticism in an effort to win the party\u2018s backing for the Supreme Court nominee.Leaders of the People\u2019s Party now say they would let members vote according to their own views.Earlier in the day, Yonhap News Agency surveyed the People\u2018s Party lawmakers, in which 32 responded. Of them, 11 approved of the court nominee and one disapproved. Twenty others refused to clarify their positions.

A warning that Washington would shoot down North Korea's next missile test? A simple restatement of past policy? Officials and pundits across Asia struggled Wednesday to decode President Donald Trump's threat to \"totally destroy North Korea'' if provoked. There was, however, no immediate comment from the focus of Trump's belligerence: North Korea held its tongue in the hours after the US president's speech.In a region well used to North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons generating a seemingly never-ending cycle of threats and counter threats, Trump's comments Tuesday at the UN General Assembly stood out.\u00a0(Yonhap)South Korea officially played them down, while some politicians worried that Trump's words signaled a loss of influence for Seoul. Tokyo focused on his mention of Japanese citizens abducted by the North. Analysts across Asia expressed surprise, even wry amusement, in one case, that Trump's words seemed to mirror threats normally emanating from North Korean state media. Officials from the office of President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who has advocated dialogue with the North while being forced into a hawkish position by the North's weapons tests, called Trump's words a signal of Washington's strong resolve to deal with the North but essentially a repetition of a basic US policy. Trump has previously threatened the North with \"fire and fury.'' Pyongyang responded to those past remarks with a string of weapons tests, including its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and two missiles that flew over US ally Japan.A South Korean presidential official said Trump's comments are mostly a repetition of a basic stance that all options will be considered when confronting North Korea.Park Soo-hyun, a Moon spokesman, said the amount of time Trump spent on North Korea in his speech shows how seriously Washington takes the issue. Trump's comments ``reaffirmed the need to put maximum sanctions and pressure against North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations,'' so that Pyongyang realizes denuclearization is the only way forward for the future, Park said. North Korea's regular weapons tests are an attempt to create an arsenal of nuclear missiles that can threaten US troops throughout Asia and the US mainland. Pyongyang tested its first two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July and claims that it can now accurately reach the US homeland, though outside experts say the North may still need more tests before its weapons are fully viable. Each new test pushes the nation that much closer to that goal.Some South Korean opposition politicians saw the comments as another sign that South Korea is losing its voice in international efforts to deal with the North's nuclear program. Trump's UN speech came days after US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis created unease in South Korea by saying without elaboration that the United States has military options against North Korea that wouldn't involve the destruction of Seoul. The South Korean capital is within easy artillery range of the huge array of North Korean weapons dug in along a border only an hour's drive from greater Seoul's 25 million people. \"Our Defense Ministry said there has been no communication with the US defense secretary regarding his remark. It also appears there was no prior communication with President Trump before he made the comments about the total destruction of North Korea,'' said Kim Su-min, a lawmaker and spokeswoman of the People's Party.Kim said there are worries on whether the communication channel with the United States is working properly. \"The government should comprehensively review its diplomatic and national security system and do its absolute best so that our stance on critical issues related to the existence of our country and the lives of our people doesn't go ignored.''Diplomacy meant to rid the North of its nukes has been moribund for years, and Pyongyang has made huge strides over the last several years in its quest for nuclear tipped missiles that can reach anywhere in the world. Trump has pushed Beijing, which is the North's only major ally, to do more to influence Pyongyang's behavior, so far to no avail.A Chinese expert on North Korea was surprised by the vehemence of Trump's speech, saying ``his rhetoric is full of military force.'' \"When I first listened to his remarks last night, it sounded as if the US had nearly declared war on North Korea,'' Cheng Xiaohe of Renmin University said in an interview. The speech, he said, signals that \"if North Korea conducts another missile test, the US is very likely to intercept.'' Officials in Tokyo, meanwhile, welcomed a reference by Trump in his speech to North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and `80s.\"I think it means an understanding has gotten through'' to the United States and other countries, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura said, according to Kyodo News service. \"We earned understanding from President Trump.''In a list of accusations against North Korea, Trump said ``we know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.''The girl, Megumi Yokota, was one of at least 17 people that Japan says North Korea kidnapped. The issue has complicated Japan's relations with North Korea, as it seeks the return of those kidnapped while also lining up with the US to take a tough stand against North Korea's nuclear and missile tests.Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in South Korea, described Trump's threats as similar to the type of bluffing that North Korea has used for decades. \"It's a bit funny to see how the US president behaves in exactly the same way, using exactly the same words his North Korean counterparts have been using for decades,'' Lankov said. Rhetoric that isn't followed by action will eventually undermine the US image internationally. \"It makes American threats far less efficient,'' he said.

This (issue) is separate from sanctions and pressure,\" Baik Tae-hyun, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.He said that the international community is on the same page over the need to help North Koreans who suffer dire conditions and human rights violations.\"The government is sternly responding to North Korea's provocations with pressure and sanctions,\" Baik added. (Yonhap)","252":"North Korea may conduct another nuclear or missile test going forward as it aims to advance its defense capabilities through nuclear armament, Seoul's defense ministry said Monday. In a parliamentary session, the ministry presented its analysis to lawmakers based on its assessment of the North's statement released in the wake of its latest missile launch on Friday. \"North Korea flaunted having neared the final stage of securing intercontinental ballistic missile technology and how it has accomplished the skills for and weaponization of the intermediate-range ballistic missile,\" it told the parliament. The ministry clarified its initial report that was written somewhat misleadingly as if it was the ministry's conclusion that the North has almost reached the last stage for the ICBM technology. \"We have made no such assessment, but it's our interpretation of what the North has tried to assert by making such a claim,\" the ministry said. \"(The North) will continue such provocations as additional nuclear tests and missile launches to secure its nuclear capabilities. ... The Punggye-ri nuclear test site remains ready for a (new) test,\" it added.\u00a0Defense Minister Song Young-moo speaks during a parliamentary session at the National Assembly in Seoul on Sept. 18, 2017. (Yonhap)Defense Minister Song Young-moo ruled out the redeployment of US tactical nukes in a reversal of his earlier position that the idea can be weighed as an option to deter an increasingly provocative Pyongyang.\u00a0The parliamentary session was convened three days after the North fired off another intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile over Japan into the Pacific. It flew 3,700 kilometers with a maximum altitude of about 770 km.Asked to reaffirm his stance on the opposition-mooted idea of redeploying the tactical nukes, Song called it \"not proper.\" The about-face came after President Moon Jae-in dismissed it last week, saying it would destabilize Northeast Asia and spark a regional arms race.\"It is not proper. It would be helpful if we do not re-dispatch it,\" Song said.The minister said the \"best alternative\" is to independently build the \"three-axis\" system that consists of the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation, an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korea leadership in a major conflict; the Kill Chain preemptive strike platform; and the Korea Air and Missile Defense system. \"The situation has changed a lot since the withdrawal of tactical nukes (in 1991) and now we can get by as if we had the tactical nukes here,\" he said. \"Without the tactical nukes here, we have the capabilities under the South Korea-US alliance that transcends time and space.\"Song was apparently referring to a wide range of the US deterrence assets, including those stationed in Japan or other Pacific installations, which could be promptly deployed in the event of a conflict.The minister also said Seoul is striving to ensure it can jointly share control of US extended deterrence assets. He did not elaborate on the assets, but he said Seoul seeks to discuss the issue at the allies' top security talks such as the annual Security Consultative Meeting slated for next month.Extended deterrence refers to the stated US commitment to defend its ally by mobilizing all military capabilities, nuclear and conventional, against the North's aggression and provocations.Such a commitment was called into question amid Pyongyang's beefed-up push to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland. Some argue Washington may dither on defending its Asian ally under attack as its military action could put its own territory at risk.Asked whether the North is capable of deploying the Hwasong-12 missile for combat, Song voiced doubts.\"I have doubts over whether the North would do that as its reentry technology has yet to be verified,\" he said.The minister also gave a negative answer when asked if the North has the capability to strike the US territory of Guam.He, in addition, expressed skepticism over Pyongyang's ability to attack the continental US\"Before the North's missile shoots up into the atmosphere, it will be detected by South Korea, the US and Japan,\" he said. \"I judge that it might be shot down before reaching Alaska or other major cities on the US west coast.\"During the session, Song also voiced unease over controversial security remarks by Moon Chung-in, the president's security advisor.The advisor has floated the idea of scaling back South Korea-US military drills in exchange for the North's nuclear freeze, a proposal seen at odds with Washington.\"I get this feeling that he is making such remarks as a scholar, and it is deplorable that he is not being thought of as a presidential security advisor,\" he said.Also in its report to the parliament, the ministry explained that the North's missile launch Friday appears intended to flaunt its ability to strike US bases to be used to augment US troops in case of a contingency.Commenting on the motives behind the latest launch, the ministry said the provocation was in part to protest a new UN Security Council sanctions resolution adopted last Monday to punish the North's Sept. 3 nuclear test and to show its defiance of international pressure.The ministry added that the North has fired 19 missiles on 14 occasions this year and has conducted eight launches since the Moon administration took office in May.

The institute is a research arm of the National Intelligence Service.\"March has been pinned for the timing for the (United Nations Security Sanction) Resolution 2375 adopted in September to take effect, given the UN sanctions committee's position that the effects of sanctions begin to be seen six to twelve months after their introduction,\" the institute noted.Despite expected economic difficulties, it remains to be seen whether North Korea will reverse its position clinging to nuclear weapons development, according to the think tank.\u00a0 (Yonhap)\"North Korea may put further focus on building the economy while holding on to its policy line of becoming the most powerful nuclear state,\" it said. North Korea, however, is presumed to use South Korea's hosting of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics as an opportunity to offer dialogue with South Korea, the institute predicted. It also forecast that North Korea could go for additional military provocations if the fence-mending attempt ends in failure, possibly a test to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile as far as possible, a test launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile or even its seventh nuclear test.On whether the North would join the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea, the institute said, \"All the steps for participation have been completed except for (leader) Kim Jong-un's final decision.\" In 2018, Kim would continue to ostracize and purge military elites and high-ranking officials, the institute also predicted.\"In the event of severe economic difficulties due to sanctions on North Korea, economic elites could possibly fall victim (of purging) as they are made to take responsibility,\" according to the institute. North Korean Premier Park Pong-ju could be possibly one of the targets, it said.As part of on-going purging efforts, Hwang Pyong-so, previously chief of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, has been steeply demoted and is currently working at a government department, but he retained membership with the ruling party, while Kim Won-hong, formerly deputy chief at the military bureau, is working at a farm without any possibility of reinstatement, according to the think tank.\u00a0 The national spy agency earlier said the two ranking military officials were punished for \"impure\" acts.

Tillerson reaffirmed the US' unwavering commitment to helping protect South Korea, along with Japan, against any threats.\u00a0 (Yonhap)They also agreed to take \"powerful\" and \"stern\" measures in a way that leads the North to give up its provocative behavior and come out for denuclearization talks, it added. And they vowed to maintain \"strategic\" communication between the allies through diverse channels and at each level, including the upcoming UN General Assembly to be held in New York next week.Their discussion, meanwhile, was cut short at first due to a poor connection as Tillerson was on his way back to Washington from a trip to London. They resumed their conversation on the matter after he got back to the US, a ministry official said.Kang later held a phone conversation with Kono to discuss a coordinated approach to the matter, according to the ministry.Kono emphasized the importance of strengthening the three-way cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the US through diverse channels including the UN Security Council so as to produce \"more powerful and effective\" measures against the North, the ministry said.

John E. Hyten, commander of Strategic Command, told reporters that while he was not in a position to confirm it, he assumes from the size of the underground explosion and other factors that it was a hydrogen bomb _ which is a leap beyond the fission, or atomic, bombs North Korea has previously tested. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, left, is escorted at Offutt Air Force Base by Gen. John E. Hyten, the head of Strategic Command, in Bellevue, Neb., (AP-Yonhap)North Korea claimed they exploded a hydrogen bomb, and while US officials have not contradicted them, they have not confirmed it, either. Administration officials had indicated they saw nothing to contradict the North's claim. Hyten went further, saying the characteristics of the test made him think it was an H-bomb.Hyten would not discuss the exact size of the explosion from the Sept. 3 test, but Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that it was in excess of 100 kilotons _ far larger than any of the North's five previous nuclear tests.\"When I look at a thing that size, I as a military officer assume that it's a hydrogen bomb,\" Hyten said. As head of Strategic Command, he would be in charge of all elements of the US nuclear force in the event of nuclear war.\"I have to (assume this),\" he added, \"I have to make that assumption. What I saw equates to a hydrogen bomb. I saw the event. I saw the indications that came from that event. I saw the size, I saw the reports, and therefore to me I'm assuming it was a hydrogen bomb.\"Asked whether it matters that the North Koreans had advanced to testing a hydrogen bomb, Hyten said, \"Yes. The change from the original atomic bomb to the hydrogen bomb for the United States\" in the 1940s changed America's strategic relationship with the Soviet Union because of \"the sheer destruction and damage you can create with a weapon that size.\" The Soviets quickly matched the US by exploding their own hydrogen bomb well before US officials believed possible.Pressed further, Hyten said he was not confirming that it was a hydrogen bomb.\"I'm just saying the size of the weapon shows that there was clearly a secondary explosion,\" he said.Until a fission, or atomic, bomb, a hydrogen bomb is built with two \"stages,\" or explosive devices that work in tandem to create fusion. Hyten would not say how large the explosion was, but Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that it was more than 100 kilotons, which could put it in the category of an H-bomb.Hyten said that while he believes it is only a matter of time before the North Koreans have a reliable nuclear-armed missile capable of hitting the United States, they probably still have more test work to do.\"They haven't put everything together yet,\" he said, referring to the ability to build a long-range missile with a nuclear warhead that can survive the extreme heat generated by re-entering the Earth's atmosphere on its way to a US target. He said it would not be a surprise if the North Koreans were able to do that in fairly short order; he said it took the US \"less than a couple of years.\" (AP)","264":"North Korea launched an apparent intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan on Friday, the South Korean and US militaries announced.The latest in a series of the Kim Jong-un regime's provocations came three days after the UN Security Council adopted a resolution aimed at cutting the North's oil imports by a third.The \"unidentified\" missile fired from Pyongyang flew around 3,700 kilometers over Japan into the North Pacific Ocean, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. It reached a maximum altitude of some 770 km, added the JCS.It's the longest-ever flight distance of a North Korean missile except for some rockets that it claimed were space vehicles.

Guam is roughly 3,400km away from Pyongyang.It's apparently trying to hone the atmospheric re-entry technology for its various types of missiles.The South's President Moon Jae-in immediately convened a National Security Council meeting as the country's troops conducted ballistic missile training in the East Sea in response to the North's latest provocation.\u00a0(Yonhap)The military responded with the firing of two Hyunmoo-II missiles in consideration of the distance between the training site and the Sunan airfield, which is the \"origin of provocation,\" the JCS said.Fired just six minutes after the North's missile launch, one \"accurately hit\" a simulated target in the East Sea about 250 km away, a JCS official said. The other, however, fell into the water \"in the initial stage,\" he added. Related authorities are analyzing the reason.The quick response, based on the early detection of the North's provocation indications, represents the military's combat readiness, he stressed.Japanese media also reported that the North's missile overflew its northern territory of Hokkaido.The North's ballistic missile launch Friday marked the 10th since the South's left-leaning president took office in early May.It came 17 days after the North's Hwasong-12 IRBM flew over Japan, followed by its sixth underground nuclear test days later. It traveled more than 2,700 km amid reports that its full range is estimated at 4,500-5,000 km.The North earlier threatened to send four Hwagsong-12 missiles toward Guam but held off on the plan, saying it would wait and see Washington's attitude \"a little more.\"North Korea watchers say it may shoot a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile in the near future.The North plans to celebrate the founding anniversary of the powerful Workers' Party on Oct. 10.\"To build out its nuclear deterrent, Pyongyang will continue to test all sorts of different types of missiles and nuclear weapons,\" Harry J.

The NIS later said they never underwent the state-run resettlement program like all other defectors, for protection as it's a very high-profile defection.

The ruling camp accused the opposition of acting \"irresponsibly and high-handedly, with Choo taking umbrage particularly at the People's Party.A day earlier, Choo upbraided the minor party for \"flaunting its presence and flexing its muscle through a shameless act.\" She also criticized it for only insisting the ruling bloc take the initiative in strengthening cooperation with the opposition-led legislature.Such remarks only drew the ire of the opposition parties.\"It makes me wonder if she, with such an immodest attitude, can be called a ruling party leader,\" Park Jie-won, the former leader of the People's Party, said during a radio interview. \"She should reflect on herself and seek an apology from the citizens (for the rejection of the court nominee).\"Kim Kwan-young, the party's secretary-general, called on Choo to \"remain silent for the nation and president.\"The conservative parties also pounced on her, calling for her to show \"humility.\"\"Her behavior yesterday was the ultimate case of one in the wrong shifting the blame to the other,\" Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, said, calling for her to take a period of self-reflection.Ha Tae-kyeung, a senior lawmaker of the Bareun Party, stepped in the fray.\"I want to ask Choo if her main enemy is the North Korean regime or our opposition parties,\" he said in a statement dripping with sarcasm over the liberal ruling party's dovish stance toward the provocative state.The two-day confirmation hearing for the chief justice nominee continued Wednesday.Kim was grilled particularly over his ideological orientation, which conservative parties say could undermine the core judicial principle of political neutrality.At issue was Kim's previous role in leading a group of liberal judges. Thus, the president's designation of Kim has caused consternation among conservatives that fear it could fuel the judiciary's swing to the left. Kim's 2015 ruling in favor of a progressive teachers' union further reinforced the argument that the nominee appears politically skewed and thus incapable of rendering aboveboard rulings.\u00a0 Kim's appointment requires consent from a majority of lawmakers present during a floor vote that can be set up by a majority of all 299 legislators.

(Yonhap)Resolution 2375 also includes a ban on exports of North Korean textiles, a key source of revenue for the regime and restrictions on the use of North Korean workers overseas. It also prohibits North Korean imports of liquefied natural gas and condensates. South Korea's unification ministry said that North Korea appeared to be responding at the lowest level but that the situation still warrants close monitoring.\"North Korea has so far conducted provocative acts in response to sanctions, and its foreign ministry also issued a warning one day before the UN vote,\" Baik Tae-hyun, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.\"Given this situation, we need to watch further (to gauge North Korea's intention). We are urging the North to end the vicious circle of repeating provocations and sanctions and start a dialogue for the peaceful resolution of its nuclear issue,\" he added.US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the latest UN sanctions are just another \"very small step\" and \"nothing compared to\" what will happen in dealing with North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also warned that if China fails to fully implement the new UN sanctions, the US could impose additional sanctions on China and prevent it from accessing the US financial system.The US had pushed for a complete oil embargo for the latest UN punitive measures. But the council adopted the watered-down sanctions resolution as China and Russia, two of the five veto-wielding council members, reportedly balked at any move that could destabilize the impoverished country.Experts said that the fresh UN sanctions may not be sufficient enough to prod North Korea to change its behavior.But it is meaningful that, by targeting oil supplies to the regime for the first time, the international community signaled a strong warning that tougher actions could be taken in the future, they added.\"North Korea appears to have given a less-than-threatening reaction in response to the weakened resolution,\" said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. \"It may be related to the UNSC decision not to blacklist Kim Jong-un -- unlike the proposal in its original draft.\"There is a possibility that Pyongyang could carry out further provocations around Oct. 10, the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.Seoul's spy agency said last week that North Korea could fire an intercontinental ballistic missile on a standard trajectory toward the Pacific Ocean around that date.

It thinks it can victimize its own people and continues to develop and test nuclear weapons,\" he said in a press conference held on the occasion of the publication of the Korean version of his 2006 autobiography. \"In order to block this, the international community should muster the utmost efforts. But the resolution must be peaceful and diplomatic,\" he said.\u00a0(Yonhap)For its part, South Korea should \"keep giving out the signal that it is willing to talk (with North Korea) whenever conditions are met,\" he suggested, adding dialogue offers need to be kept up despite North Korea's repeated rejections.\"I think South Korea needs to give that message without halting and with a renewed spirit.\"Still, the resolution of the North Korean nuclear problem requires a joint strategy by major powers, namely the United States, China and Russia, he stressed. \"Peaceful and diplomatic resolution will be possible only when the three neighboring powers implement a joint strategy toward North Korea,\" Schroeder said, pointing out that ongoing American economic pressure on China and sanctions on Russia are not helpful for the coveted three-nation partnership.Asked for advice for South Korean diplomacy against the backdrop of growing rivalries between superpowers, Schroeder said South Korea could be relatively more independent of the US diplomatically.He also expressed regret over Japan for withholding an apology to South Korean victims of the country's wartime sexual enslavement, the source of a long-running diplomatic feud between Seoul and Tokyo.\"This crime is not something the current Japanese generations have committed, but they are responsible for the historical fact of the past,\" Schroeder noted. \"I am sorry for Japan for having not yet been able to have the courage to apologize to the elderly women,\" he said of dozens of older South Korean victims, some of whom he met a day earlier in the country.Later in the day, Schroeder met with President Moon Jae-in at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.During the talks, Moon touted Germany's efforts to atone for its wartime misdeeds, while pointing to Korea's unresolved historical issues in an apparent allusion to its former colonizer, Japan.\"Germany understood the issues about its past through its sincere reflection and was able to move toward the future,\" Moon said.Moon also expressed his gratitude to Schroeder's visit this week to a shelter for South Korean victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery. (Yonhap)","277":"A South Korean-born Sydney man was charged Sunday with acting as an economic agent for North Korea in Australia by allegedly attempting to broker sales worth tens of millions of dollars for Pyongyang that included components used in ballistic missiles. The Australian Federal Police said 59-year-old naturalized Australian Chan Han Choi used encrypted communication to broker sales and discuss the supply of weapons of mass destruction. His actions contravened both United Nations and Australian sanctions against North Korea, police said. Police said the man was acting to generate income for Pyongyang by arranging the sale of computer software used for guiding ballistic missiles as well as expertise from North Korea to other \"international entities.\" Police didn't elaborate.\u00a0(Australian Federal Police)Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had been briefed by AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin on the \"very, very serious matter\" and warned anyone thinking of assisting North Korea that \"the AFP will find you.\"\"North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime threatening the peace of the region,\" Turnbull said. \"It supports itself by breaching UN sanctions, not simply by selling commodities like coal and other goods, but also by selling weapons, by selling drugs, by engaging in cybercrime.\"He added: \"It is vitally important that all nations work relentlessly to enforce those sanctions because the more economic pressure that can be brought on North Korea, the sooner that regime will be brought to its senses.\"Despite international sanctions, cash-strapped North Korea last month test-fired its most powerful missile that may be able to target the US mainland.Choi is facing six charges related to brokering the sale of missile componentry and expertise from North Korea to other international entities, and attempting to transfer coal from North Korea to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam. Choi didn't appear or apply for bail in a Sydney court Sunday, and bail was formally refused. Federal police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said the governments of Indonesia and Vietnam _ or authorities in those countries _ were not involved in the coal transfer attempt. Choi is the first person charged under Australia's Weapons of Mass Destruction Act and could face a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Gaughan said the charges related to his alleged activity over the past year, but that allegations dated back to 2008. Choi was arrested Saturday and charged over two transactions that were unsuccessful. \"But we estimate that if these trades were successful, we're talking tens of millions of dollars,\" Gaughan told reporters. He said investigations were continuing and that more charges could be filed against Choi. \"The AFP are saying this man was a loyal agent of North Korea, believing he was acting to serve some high patriotic purpose,\" Gaughan said. Police started investigating Choi after a tip-off from another international agency on another matter, he said. \"I know these charges sound alarming, but we are not suggesting that there are any weapons or missile componentry that came to Australian soil,\" he said. \"We're alleging all of the activity occurred offshore.\" Choi's activities also involved commodities including oil and gemstones. \"This is black market 101. It's the same with the coal and oil and gemstones _ it's all about making money for North Korea,\" he said, adding the case was \"like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil.\" \"Any individual who attempts to fly in the face of sanctions cannot and will not go unnoticed in Australia,\" he said. (AP)","278":"The UN Security Council on Monday unanimously approved new sanctions on North Korea in a watered-down resolution that eliminated a ban on all oil imports and an international asset freeze on the government and leader Kim Jong Un that the Trump administration wanted. The resolution does ban North Korea from importing all natural gas liquids and condensates. But it caps Pyongyang's imports of crude oil at the level of the last 12 months, and it limits the import of refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels a year. It also bans all textile exports and prohibits countries from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers \u2014\u00a0 two key sources of hard currency for the northeast Asian nation. US Ambassador Nikki Haley told the council after the vote that \"these are by far the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea ... but we all know these steps only work if all nations implement them completely and aggressively.\"\"Today we are saying the world will never accept a nuclear armed North Korea,\" she said. \"We are done trying to prod the regime to do the right thing\" and now are instead taking steps to prevent it \"from doing the wrong thing.\"(Yonhap)Haley reiterated that the United States does not want war and said \"North Korea has not yet passed the point of no return.\" She said if Pyongyang gives up its nuclear program and proves it can live in peace, the world will live in peace with it.The resolution represents a swift response to North Korea's sixth and strongest nuclear test explosion Sept. 3, which it said was a hydrogen bomb, and to its escalating launches of increasingly sophisticated ballistic missiles that it says can reach the United States.The text was agreed to after final negotiations between the US and China, the North's ally and major trading partner. Haley praised the \"strong relationship\" between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping for enabling the resolution's adoption.But its provisions are a significant climb-down from the toughest-ever sanctions that the Trump administration proposed in the initial draft resolution it circulated last Tuesday, especially on oil, where a complete ban could have crippled North Korea's economy.The cap on the import of petroleum products could have an impact but North Korea will still be able to import the same amount of crude oil that is has this year. According to the US Energy Information Administration, China supplies most of North Korea's crude oil imports, which a US official put at 4 million barrels a year. The agency cited UN customs data showing that China reported sending 6,000 barrels a day of oil products to North Korea, which it said is mostly gasoline and diesel fuel vital to the country's agriculture, transportation and military sectors. That would mean North Korea imports nearly 2.2 million barrels a year in petroleum products, so the 2 million barrel cap in the resolution would represent a 10 percent cut. But the US official said North Korea now receives about 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products, which would mean a more than 50 percent cut. The textile ban is significant. Textiles are North Korea's main source of export revenue after coal, iron, seafood and other minerals that have already been severely restricted by previous UN resolutions. North Korean textile exports in 2016 totaled $752.5 million, accounting for about one-fourth of its total $3 billion in merchandise exports, according to South Korean government figures.The US official, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the council vote, said the Trump administration believes the new sanctions combined with previous measures would ban over 90 percent of North Korea's exports reported in 2016.As for North Koreans working overseas, the official said the US expects the cutoff on new work permits will cost North Korea about $500 million a year once current work permits expire. The US estimates about 93,000 North Koreans are currently working abroad, the official said.\u00a0 The original US draft would have ordered all countries to impose an asset freeze and travel ban on Kim Jong Un and four other top party and government officials. The resolution adopted Monday adds only one person to the sanctions list \u2014 Pak Yong Sik, a member of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Military Commission, which controls the country's military and helps direct its military industries. The original US draft would also have frozen the assets of North Korea's state-owned airline Air Koryo, the Korean People's Army and five other powerful military and party entities. The new resolution drops sanctions on the airline and army and would only add the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea and the party's powerful Organization and Guidance Department and its Propaganda and Agitation Department to the sanctions blacklist. North Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement early Monday saying it was watching the United States' moves closely and warned that it was \"ready and willing\" to respond with measures of its own. It said the US would pay a heavy price if the sanctions proposed by Washington are adopted. Britain's UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, told reporters who questioned the watering down of the initial US text that \"there is a significant prize in keeping the whole of the Security Council united and I very much hope that all my council colleagues will vote in favor of the revised draft.\" Rycroft called the resolution \"very robust\" and \"a very significant set of additional sanctions on imports into North Korea and exports out of North Korea and other measures as well.\"French Ambassador Francois Delattre said, \"We are facing not a regional but a global threat, not a virtual but an immediate threat, not a serious but an existential threat.\"\"Make no mistake about it,\" he said, \"our firmness today is our best antidote to the risk of war, to the risk of confrontation, and our firmness today is our best tool for a political solution tomorrow.\"\u00a0 China and Russia had called for a resolution focused on a political solution to the escalating crisis over North Koreas nuclear program. They have proposed a freeze-for-freeze that would halt North Korean nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the US and South Korea stopping their joint military exercises but the Trump administration has rejected that.Russia argues that sanctions aren't working and President Vladimir Putin expressed concern last week that a total oil cutoff could hurt the North Korean people. The resolution adds new language urging \"further work to reduce tensions so as to advance the prospects for a comprehensive settlement,\" and underscoring \"the imperative of achieving the goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner.\"It retains language reaffirming support for long-stalled six-party talks with that goal involving North Korea, the US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. The resolution also adds language underscoring the Security Council's commitment to North Korea's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to \"a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the situation,\" and \"its concern that developments on the Korean Peninsula could have dangerous, large-scale regional security implications.\"It retains language on the council's \"determination to take further significant measures\" in the event of a new nuclear test or ballistic missile launch.

Most of the damage caused by the downpours, or 230 cases, were reported there.\u00a0Busan (Yonhap)Small buildings collapsed and some 600 elementary, middle and high schools as well as 400 kindergartens were closed. Soil at a construction site was washed away, damaging six cars. At least nine people were rescued after they were trapped in waterlogged buildings or cars. Seven major roads were temporarily shut down.Some 210 national parks were restricted from access, and 15 flights were canceled. No deaths were reported. Heavy showers, which began to batter the southern region early Monday morning, continued through the early afternoon. All the heavy rain warnings in seven cities were lifted as of 12:30 p.m. A heavy rain warning is issued when a region is expected to receive more than 110 mm of rain in six hours or more than 180 mm of rain in 12 hours. As of noon, Geoje had received the most rainfall of 308 mm, followed by Tongyeong at 273 mm and Busan with 263.2 mm. Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province were not affected.After the unexpected downpour, the weather agency came under fire for its failure to predict the rainfall and its botched response. The weather agency initially forecast more than 30 mm of rain to fall per hour, totaling some 150 mm in southern regions. Text messages were belatedly sent to citizens to notify them of the restricted roads in Busan, hours after the restriction was lifted. Regional education offices informed students that schools would be temporarily closed at around 8:10 a.m., after some students had already left for school. The KMA cited the high temperature and humidity, coupled with low atmospheric pressure, as the reason behind the heavier than expected rainfall. According to a 2017 report from the Board of Audit and Inspection, Korea\u2019s weather agency got about 46 percent of predictions accurate between 2012 and 2015.(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","281":"The National Assembly on Monday rejected President Moon Jae-in\u2019s nominee for the Constitutional Court president, in spite of a prolonged void in the top judiciary\u2019s leadership.

The Liberty Korea Party, which has been boycotting parliamentary sessions, has decided to return to legislature and push for the measure.

Nearly 80 percent of the respondents aged 50 or above agreed to the country\u2019s nuclear rearmament. The move came a day after the conservative party decided to end its legislative boycott of ongoing parliamentary sessions. The party had refused to attend the sessions and staged public protests since the court issued an arrest warrant on the head of a state-run broadcaster on Sept. 1. Kim Jang-kyom, who heads public broadcaster MBC, is accused by his own company\u2019s labor union of having exercised his influence to produce newscasts that were deemed favorable to the then President Park Geun-hye.

That means the only path we can take is through operating tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d Liberty Korea Party\u2019s Chairman Rep.

Following North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile launches and its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, calls have been mounting among conservative opposition parties that South Korea should develop its own nuclear weapon or at least bring back tactical nukes from the US. While Seoul and Washington have dismissed the possibility of redeploying US tactical nukes and maintained the principle of a nuclear-free South Korea, some analysts suspect that this might change during the Trump administration. According to a report by NBC on Friday, an anonymous White House official said that the US administration is not ruling out moving tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, if Seoul requests them, though many consider such a move a nonstarter.\u201cWe have never reviewed a plan to reintroduce (US) tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d an official from South Korea\u2019s presidential office said under the condition of anonymity Sunday, in response to a question about Seoul\u2019s position on the NBC report. \u201cOur commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula remains unchanged.\u201d The official warned that if South Korea brought back US tactical nukes, Seoul would lose the moral grounds for its demand that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear weapons.

With previous sanctions resolutions, the US spent weeks and sometimes months negotiating the text with China and then presenting a resolution to the rest of the Security Council for a vote. A man watches a TV news program on a public screen showing an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while reporting North Korea`s possible nuclear test in Tokyo Sunday, Sept. 3, 2017. (AP-Yonhap)Several diplomats said the US demand for a speedy council vote was aimed at putting maximum pressure on China and reflected Washington's escalating concern over North Korea's latest nuclear test, which its leaders touted as a hydrogen bomb, and its recent ballistic missile launch over Japan.Britain's UN Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, who backs \"robust\" new sanctions, said Thursday that the US proposals to ban all oil imports and textile exports and prohibit North Koreans from working overseas _ which helps fund and fuel the country's nuclear and missile programs _ are \"a proportionate response\" to its \"illegal and reckless behavior.\"Rycroft stressed that \"maximum possible pressure\" must be exerted on North Korea to change course and give diplomacy a chance to end the crisis.\u00a0 The proposed US sanctions would also freeze all foreign financial assets of the government and its leader, Kim Jong Un. The US draft also identified nine ships that have carried out activities prohibited by previous UN resolutions and would authorize any UN member state to stop these vessels on the high seas without their consent and use \"all necessary measures\" _ which in UN language includes force _ to carry out an inspection and direct the vessel to a port. Professor Joseph DeThomas of Pennsylvania State University, a former US ambassador and State Department official who dealt with North Korea, said the US demand for quick council action is \"an indicator of how the administration thinks time has run out.\"\"My sense is they believe that they don't have time for a delicate diplomatic dance,\" he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Friday. \"The other possibility ... is they want to see the color of China's money. They're putting down the marker here and saying 'OK, Are you prepared to do what is necessary to put pressure on North Korea at a moment when we're simply out of time?\"'The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions on the resolution have been private, said all 15 Security Council members discussed the draft on Friday, and both China and Russia appeared willing to negotiate.Russia has said sanctions aren't working and President Vladimir Putin expressed concern that a total oil cutoff could hurt the North Korean people. Beijing and Moscow have called for a resolution that focuses on a political solution and have proposed a freeze-for-freeze that would halt North Korean nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the US and South Korea halting their joint military exercises _ an initiative rejected by the Trump administration. There was no word on the outcome of negotiations, and whether any changes sought by the Russians and Chinese were acceptable to the United States.A brief statement from the US Mission to the United Nations late Friday said: \"This evening, the United States informed the UN Security Council that it intends to call a meeting to vote on a draft resolution to establish additional sanctions on North Korea on Monday, September 11.\"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called the nuclear risk in North Korea the most dangerous crisis in the world today, told reporters Tuesday that \"the unity of the Security Council is absolutely crucial.\" He explained that only a united council can provide the pressure needed to enable successful negotiations to take place to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.DeThomas agreed that it was unwise to break the unity of the Security Council, but he said the US administration is unlikely to accept \"a very watered down approach.\"\"It's clear that American diplomacy over the past two decades has failed because this is where we are with North Korea, but if we failed, the Chinese ought to be abjectly embarrassed over their failures,\" he said. \"We have no leverage. They have a lot of leverage. They have produced nothing.\"\"To get the situation contained without war is going to be really hard, and that's if we've got our diplomacy right,\" he said. \"If we start breaking crockery diplomatically, I don't see how you get anywhere without the Russians and Chinese _ especially the Chinese.\"DeThomas said putting the Chinese \"on the other team\" won't benefit the United States in the long-term.He explained that this would force the US, and possibly Japan and South Korea, to try to do things unilaterally to increase pressure on North Korea. But he said trying to stop goods and material flowing from China to North Korea without UN backing would substitute a US-China confrontation for the current nuclear weapons crisis with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name.As for the North Koreans, their official news agency on Friday said the country's \"nuclear weaponization ... has reached its final phase.\"The KCNA report sharply criticized US Ambassador Nikki Haley for playing \"the flagship role\" in the Trump administration's \"hideous sanctions and pressure racket against the DPRK.\" The agency called Haley \"a political prostitute\" and dismissed as \"rubbish\" her comments at an emergency Security Council meeting Monday following the latest nuclear test that the DPRK is \"begging for a war.\" The agency accused the US of being the \"chieftain of aggression and war and wrecker of peace.\"The US Mission to the United Nations said it had no comment on the KCNA report, which concluded by saying: \"The US administration will have to pay a dear price for her tongue-lashing.\" (AP)","289":"Traces of xenon gas, a radionuclide, were detected in South Korea, the nuclear safety agency said Friday, five days after North Korea conducted its most powerful nuclear test.\u00a0\u00a0 The the radioactive material, the xenon-133 isotope, was found in the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission's analysis of ground, air and maritime samplings that were collected locally after the latest nuclear test by the North, according to the agency.\u00a0 (Yonhap)\u00a0\u00a0 Defying international warnings, North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful yet nuclear test Sunday, claiming it was a hydrogen bomb that can be loaded atop an intercontinental ballistic missile. \u00a0\u00a0 The detected amount measures 0.43 milibecquerel per cubic meter or 0.03 mBq\/\u33a5, according to the analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 The agency is currently tracking down the inflow of the material to conclude whether it is a result of the nuclear test.\u00a0\u00a0 The agency added, however, that the amount would not have any health effects as South Korea's background radiation currently remains at the usual level of 50-300 nanosieverts per hour.

While an oil embargo is seen one of the most effective of all sanctions against the reclusive regime, it is not an easy one to be implemented, experts noted, since it would have to involve China and Russia. \u201cAll international sanctions against North Korea effectively depends on China. It is difficult to predict but it is unlikely that China would completely stop its oil export to its communist ally,\u201d a Korea Institute for National Unification researcher told The Korea Herald, declining to be named.North Korea is known to import about 1 million tons of crude and petroleum products from China according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. It is presumed that some 300,000 tons of crude oil is also shipped from Russia. China has neither confirmed nor denied its oil trade with the North.North Korean Prime Minister Park Bong-ju (3rd from R) talks with officials of an oil refinery in this photo released by the state-run Rodong Sinmun on March 21, 2016. (For Use Only in the Republic of Korea. No Redistribution) (Yonhap)The EIA estimates that the communist state\u2019s oil consumption last year averaged at 15,000 barrels a day, which is extremely small compared with almost 2.6 million barrels a day in South Korea and 12.5 million in China.China\u2019s first-ever shut down of the oil pipeline towards the North was in 2003, when North Korea appeared skeptical of taking part in the six-party talks in the August. China reportedly cut the crude supply for three days, and it moved its rogue ally to the table. The United States is moving to impose the \u201cstrongest possible measures\u201d and is currently working to present a draft of the new sanctions resolution to the council to be negotiated in the coming days, with a view of voting on it next Monday.\u201cOnly the strongest sanctions will enable us to resolve this problem through diplomacy,\u201d UN envoy Nikki Haley said, adding that North Korea is \u201cbegging for war.\u201dDiplomats said the new sanctions could possibly target oil supplies bound for the reclusive regime.However, China and Russia, the sole oil providers, are maintaining that the tension should be resolved through dialogue, while denouncing their rogue ally\u2019s recent test. A temporary or partial ban is possible, but the Chinese government would definitely refuse to cut off oil exports completely or permanently to North Korea, Chinese cabinet adviser Shi Yinhong was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg report Monday. One of the reasons for their rejection of the move could be fears that an economic collapse in neighboring North Korea would lead to chaos and a more dangerous security crisis on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea appears to be aware of the possibility of additional international sanctions. It already set a goal in April to increase its oil reserves to 1 million tons, Japan\u2019s Tokyo Shimbun reported. The amount accounts for about half to two-thirds of the North\u2019s annual imports of the crude oil and petroleum products, it added. Since 2006, when Pyongyang first tested its nuclear device, the UN council has imposed seven sets of sanctions but the recalcitrant regime has repeatedly found ways to circumvent the measures.

Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for the Seoul-based Advocates for Public Interest Law, claimed that migrant fishing crews are at risk of forcible labor and human trafficking, as they are unable to seek help or leave work while at sea.\u00a0An outdoor billboard carries an advertisement by an agency recruiting foreign fishermen to work on Korean-owned vessels in Manila, Philippines. (IOM)\u201cMost migrant fishermen were poor, less educated and had job insecurity in their own countries, so they sign contracts even though they are aware of appalling labor conditions,\u201d he said during a forum jointly hosted by APIL, International Organization for Migration\u2019s Korea office and the Human Rights Network for Migrant Fishermen. \u201cSouth Korean government and ship operators are partially accountable for such abuses.\u201dAPIL and IOM recently published a report titled \u201cTied at Sea: Human Rights Violations of Migrant Workers on Korean Fishing Vessels,\u201d based on their two-year investigation and interviews with some 70 migrant fishermen based in Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.The report details vulnerabilities of migrant fishermen on Korean-owned vessels in every stage of migration -- how they were lured by recruiting agencies with a promise of high wages, paid large sums of commission fees and were forced into a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation. The investigation found that migrant fishing crews in general suffer from poor living conditions, long hours of work, discriminatory pay, confiscation of their documents, verbal and physical assault, among other issues.\u201cThe process of recruiting and managing migrant fishermen is too complicated. In accordance with the size of a ship, different laws apply and different ministries oversee the recruitment system and labor conditions,\u201d Kim said, pointing to the legal limbo which leaves foreign workers unprotected. In South Korea, migrant workers hired on ships which weigh 20 tons or over in coastal and high seas are subject to the Seafarers Act, under the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Foreign workers on boats weighing less than 20 tons are under the Employment Permit System run by the Labor Ministry. Only those under the EPS are subject to the Labor Standards Act, which stipulates working hours and labor rights, and the Minimum Wage Act, which states the minimum wage set annually by the government. The Seafarers Act does not stipulate labor rights or minimum wage for foreign fishermen. \u201cThere needs to be a single ministry and single law that manage foreign fishermen,\u201d he said, adding that the two-way system of managing foreign fishermen results in relevant ministries shifting their responsibility to monitor the process of recruitment and working conditions. Kim and activists called on the government to play a bigger role in making the recruitment and employment process more transparent. They suggested it classify the fishing vessels into three categories to better monitor labor conditions by the categories, as well as enact laws and institutions to protect migrant fishermen\u2019 rights. South Korea began to receive migrant fishermen in 1993 to fill the labor shortage in the fishing industry. The industry is heavily reliant on migrant fishermen amid young people\u2019s reluctance to fill jobs in the agriculture, fishing and farming sectors. As of the end of 2016, the number of migrant fishing crew stood at 11,305, accounting for 41 percent of the total fishing crew in South Korea. The number has seen a gradual increase from 9,162 in 2010 to 11,815 in 2015. \u201cWe are managing to sustain our business by hiring foreigners because there are no Koreans willing to do the job. Human rights are of course important, but you should know that the situation has improved a lot,\u201d said Kim Jung-su, president of a local fishing firm Sajo Industries. \u201cAnd we also have our own problems such as stiff competition with foreign seafood companies.\u201dAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Korea produced seafood worth 5.5 trillion won, ranking 13th in the world in 2014. The government officials talked about their own difficulties in improving the situation for foreign fishermen. \u201cWe are educating Korean fishing crews on human rights, set up a call center to receive complains from migrant fishermen, increase the number of officers monitoring working conditions, for example,\u201d Seo Jin-hee from the Fisheries Ministry said. \u201cIt is not only a problem facing foreign fishermen. It is also a problem for Korean seamen as the fishing makes them leave their family and land for long,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will put priority on protecting human rights and try to improve the situation.\u201d Human rights abuses facing migrant fishermen first came to light in 2012 when 32 Indonesian crews on the Korea-flagged long haul fishing vessel Oyang 75 escaped it in New Zealand. They claimed that they were verbally, sexually and physically assaulted, and not paid their wages, which was confirmed by both Korean and New Zealand authorities. Since then, there have been growing calls for measures to improve the working conditions for migrant fishermen on Korean-owned vessels, but activists claimed that there had not been significant improvements. \u201cThere has been criticism that migrant fishermen were left unprotected because fishing vessels are not subjected to the government\u2019s regulations and monitoring,\u201d said Rep. Park Ju-min of the Democratic Party of Korea, one of the lawmakers who hosted the event. \u201cWe cannot neglect such a situation and we will make efforts to improve fishermen\u2019s human rights in the country.\u201dBy Ock Hyun-ju(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","314":"Medical staff at Ewha Womans University Medical Center face investigation after the deaths of four premature babies late Saturday.The Seoul hospital\u2019s PR director Kim Han-su said at a press conference Sunday that four premature babies at the hospital\u2019s intensive care nursery suffered cardiac arrest and died between\u00a09:32 p.m. and 10:53 p.m. Kim said the medical team performed CPR on the babies following the cardiac arrest, but all four of them died.

Under the Moon administration, Seoul has also renewed the push to increase its missile capabilities, which are limited under missile guidelines with the US. In the latest move, Seoul seeks to raise the maximum payload of locally developed ballistic missiles to 1 ton from the current 500 kilograms. According to Cheong Wa Dae, US President Donald Trump \u201cagreed in principle\u201d to allow the changes sought by Seoul. While Moon\u2019s approach to North Korea hardens, talks of bringing US\u2019 tactical nuclear weapons back to South Korea have reemerged, which is a move that has long been championed by conservatives. North Korea\u2019s increasingly serious provocations have prompted the current liberal administration\u2019s Minister of National Defense Song Young-moo to discuss the issue with his US counterpart. By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","327":"With Sunday\u2019s nuclear test, North Korea is seen drawing increasingly closer to becoming a full-fledged nuclear weapons state, which would further unsettle Northeast Asia\u2019s geopolitical landscape and may escalate risks of a military standoff. State media said the test was designed to chiefly examine the technology to adjust the explosive power of a hydrogen bomb to be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. As a result, it proved the high reliability of the device\u2019s mutually reinforcing fission-fusion reactions. In a separate dispatch hours earlier, the official Korean Central News Agency said the bomb is a \u201cmulti-functional thermonuclear weapon with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful electromagnetic pulse attack.\u201d The North\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un took a look himself at the device, whose explosive power is adjustable from tens to hundreds of kilotons and whose components are all \u201chomemade\u201d and can accordingly be mass-produced, it said.\u00a0North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (far right) visits the Nuclear Weapons Institute on Sunday in Pyongyang. (Yonhap)The latest underground detonation was the North\u2019s sixth, since its maiden round in 2006, and potentially its last one, experts say, noting a country would typically conduct five or six tests before mastering the bombs. India and Pakistan were believed to have each tested their devices five and six times until 1998.In the fourth test in January last year, Pyongyang claimed for the first time to have employed a hydrogen bomb. But South Korea\u2019s military and intelligence agency assessed it was likely to be only a boosted fission weapon, citing the event\u2019s relatively weak 4.8 magnitude tremor and 6-kiloton yield. While initial assessments vary, the 6.3 magnitude sixth test may have yielded up to 100 kilotons -- the biggest ever so far and five times that of the US\u2019 Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki in 1945 -- according to Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Bareun Party, who chairs the parliamentary defense committee. Seoul\u2019s military put its preliminary estimates at 5.7 magnitude and about 50 kilotons.\u00a0Pyongyang residents watch a video screen showing a newsreader announcing that the country has successfully tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday. (AFP-Yonhap)The explosion also came about one month after Pyongyang successfully fired an ICBM for a second time, which it claimed was capable of reaching the continental US. Taken together, the Kim Jong-un regime appears to have managed to swiftly advance its nuclear and missile capabilities -- possibly to the point that it does not need any more major launches and underground explosions, observers say. \u201cNow we have to think that the rules of the game have completely changed in the security issues of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d lawmaker Kim said at a news conference. \u201cNorth Korea virtually declared today that it is a nuclear weapons state. \u2026 The one thing left for the North is to equip the missiles with nuclear warheads, mass produce and deploy them. They\u2019ve crossed the red line.\u201d Kim Dong-yub, a professor at Kyungnam University\u2019s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said the KCNA report\u2019s reference to the fission elements and ongoing development process suggested the latest test once again involved a boosted fission weapon. But he noted KCNA images indicated otherwise as they showed Kim Jong-un inspecting a silver-colored, peanut-shaped warhead mockup akin to the appearance of a two-stage thermonuclear bomb, unlike a ball-shaped device unveiled previously. \u201cThe experiment appears to target South Korea and the US which view that the North does not have an ICBM warhead with decent explosive power given their doubts over its warhead lightening and miniaturizing technology,\u201d the professor said. \u201cI think North Korea is maximizing fears and pressure against the US by highlighting the existing threat, which is its missiles, and a future threat with the images of a hydrogen bomb.\u201d\u00a0This combo of file photos shows an April 15 image of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during a military parade in Pyongyang and a July 19 image of US President Donald Trump speaking in Washington. (AFP-Yonhap)Pyongyang dramatically ups ante in standoff with US\u00a0The Donald Trump administration, for its part, is expected to harden its line against the regime, faced with rising threats that it is nearly capable of striking the US mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile. Japan, which has been voicing its opposition against talks with the North, especially after it launched a missile over the archipelago last week, also delivered a stern rebuke after the latest provocation, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and vowing stringent countermeasures. Skepticism may also well resurface over the efficacy of sanctions as all the weapons experiments have taken place in defiance of a series of UN Security Council resolutions and independent punitive measures by Seoul, Washington, Tokyo and other countries. Debate has been rising for the need to prepare military action on the communist state\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities, especially following the two ICBM liftoffs. Some former administration officials and experts around Washington have floated the idea of a pre-emptive attack on the condition that the US and South Korea detect clear signs of the North\u2019s immediate missile launch.In 2015, the allies completed the drawing of a new operational plan, OPCON 5015, which calls for a pre-emptive strike on the North\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities as well as \u201cdecapitation\u201d raids targeting its leadership. Their militaries have since been applying the scenario to their joint exercises.\u00a0President Moon Jae-in (far left) speaks at a National Security Council meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday.\u00a0(Cheong Wa Dae)Any potential US move for military action, however, would prompt backlash from the Moon Jae-in government, which has been saying \u201cno more war\u201d on the peninsula and calling for dialogue as a foremost solution to the crisis. The military option has its own constraints, too, such as possible flaws in intelligence and risks of miscalculations which may intensify into an all-out war. Moon nonetheless would face calls for a policy shift from not only other countries but at home. Opposition parties on Sunday urged the president to desert his peace offensive and overhaul the current approach \u201cfrom square one.\u201d Professor Kim also said now is \u201cnot the time\u201d to continue the appeal for denuclearization or a freeze-for-incentive deal to an aloof Pyongyang. \u201cThe government will need to work more with the international community to have China stop crude supplies and oil exports to the North, while exploring in earnest steps to clear Beijing\u2019s concerns over the deployment of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy at the Sejong Institute.\u201cAnd if North Korea\u2019s denuclearization turns out to be practically impossible, South Korea may have to look secretly into ways to build its own nuclear weapons.\u201d By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","328":"North Korea on Sunday conducted its sixth nuclear test, claiming that it was now capable of producing intercontinental ballistic missiles fitted with thermonuclear warheads.Pyongyang\u2019s latest provocation came in the face of international condemnation and sanctions, applied even by its traditional ally China.\u00a0South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in convened the National Security Council meeting at 1:30 p.m. Moon\u2019s top national security adviser Chung Eui-yong also held a telephone conversation with his US counterpart Herbert McMaster, Cheong Wa Dae said. According to Chung, Moon called for government officials to draw up stronger measures to punish North Korea for continued provocations.\u00a0\"In collaboration with the international community, draw up punitive measures of the highest order,\" Moon was quoted as saying by Chung.\u00a0Chung also said that Moon ordered the attending officials to use all diplomatic measures possible to \"isolate North Korea completely\" to bring about \"irreversible\" end to Pyongyang's nuclear program.In a \u201ccritical announcement\u201d held at 3:30 p.m., North Korea\u2019s state media claimed that the test was a \u201ccomplete success of a hydrogen warhead for an ICBM.\u201dSouth Koreans watch a TV broadcast about North Korea's sixth nuclear test at Seoul Station on Sunday. (Yonhap)Sunday\u2019s nuclear test took place hours after North Korea claimed that it had completed its thermonuclear technologies, and\u00a0was now capable of producing \u201cpowerful nuclear weapons at will.\u201d The latest test comes almost exactly a year after North Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test, which it also claimed was a hydrogen bomb. The fifth nuclear test, conducted on Sept. 9, 2016, had created seismic waves measuring magnitude 5.3. North Korea\u2019s nuclear test was detected by South Korean, Chinese and other authorities, at about 12:29 p.m.According to Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff office, seismic waves measuring magnitude 5.7 were detected from Punggye-ri, North Hamgyong Province in northeastern region of North Korea at 12:29 p.m. Punggye-ri is the site of Pyongyang\u2019s previous nuclear tests. Those readings would put the size of the explosion at several times larger than previous North Korean tests. It could be much larger still if the reading of 6.3 magnitude by the United States Geological Survey is correct. The Chinese government also put the size of the tremor at magnitude 6.3.According to Seoul\u2019s Meteorological Administration, the seismic activity detected in Punggyeri had the characteristics of an induced earthquake. The military announced that it suspected North Korea has conducted a nuclear test and that military readiness in South Korea had been raised. \u201cThe military has raised surveillance and readiness against North Korea, and is reviewing executing various response measures in cooperation with the US,\u201d the South Korean JCS said in a statement. Moon, who had called for dialogue with North Korea during his election campaign, has been pushed to take an increasingly harder stance following series of provocations. Following North Korea\u2019s missile launch in July, Moon ordered for more THAAD launchers to be deployed in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. After a North Korean missile flew over Japan\u2019s airspace to land in the Pacific on Aug. 29, Moon ordered the military to conduct a show-of-force exercise. While Moon\u2019s approach to North Korea hardens, talk of bringing US\u2019 tactical nuclear weapons back into South Korea has reemerged, which has long been championed by the conservatives. However, but North Korea\u2019s increasingly serious provocations have prompted the current liberal administration\u2019s Minister of National Defense Song Young-moo to discuss the issue with his US counterpart. Japan responded immediately to the suspected nuclear test with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling a national security meeting. \u201cThere is possibility that North Korea carried out a nuclear test today. If the nuclear test is proven true, it cannot be countenanced,\u201d Abe told reporters shortly after he was briefed on the issue, saying that Japan protested strongly against Pyongyang\u2019s actions. At the national security meeting, Abe reportedly told government agencies to collect and analyze intelligence, and to cooperate closely with concerned nations including South Korea, China, Russia and the US.

According to the Korean authorities and the media, a tremor with the 5.7 magnitude was detected in Gilju-gun, North Hamgyeong Province, at around 12:20 p.m. on Sunday. Another quake on scale of 4.6 was reportedly detected eight minutes later on the test site.The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the first tremor was 6.3 on the exponential scale, suggesting a far bigger test than before. The location of the epicenter was near the site where the North had detonated nuclear explosions in the past.

However, the Korean Meterological Administration said it did not detect any sign of the second quake, contradicting China's announcement. The KMA initially announced the first quake was 5.6 magnitude. It adjusted the magnitude to 5.7.\u00a0The weather agency said the North's artificial quake on Sunday is about 5 to 6 times more powerful than the fifth nuclear test last year.

The latest quakes in North Korea are raising fears that the North is accelerating its nuclear test amid the growing tension on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. The tremor's detection came hours after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspected the loading of a hydrogen bomb into a new intercontinental ballistic missile.

The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\u00a0(Yonhap)Support for continued construction rose from 37 percent in July and 40 percent in August, while opposition decreased from 41 percent in July and 42 percent in August.In an effort to reduce South Korea's dependence on nuclear energy, President Moon Jae-in proposed scrapping the project. The government then established an independent commission charged with gauging public opinion on the proposal and suspended the reactors' construction until a decision is made. The reactors were about 28.8 percent complete before the construction was suspended in July.The commission has been working on a survey project to examine public opinion.The proposal to scrap the reactors' construction sparked heated debates in a country that relies on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity.

He reportedly didn't respond to the invitation and only reiterated that the North's nuclear weapons were \"an inevitable self-defensive measure\" to guard itself against American nuclear threats.Cho also warned that the North is \"in the final stages of nuclear weaponization\" and that it will \"fundamentally alter the security landscape in the region and beyond\" if the North is capable of putting a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile.\"We should not be coerced by North Korea's continuing provocations, but rather uphold our principles while firmly responding to its reckless behaviors. At the same time, we should not be provoked into conflict nor should we shut the doors of dialogue and peace,\" he said.The international community should make the North realize how costly its provocation will cost, he said, adding that more efforts should be made by the U.N. to bring the North to the negotiating table to solve the matter peacefully.

Talking is not the answer!\"\u00a0US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. (Yonhap)It appeared to be his latest response to North Korea's firing Tuesday of a missile over Japan.He initially said in a White House statement that \"all options are on the table\" to deal with the North Korean threats.The tweet came shortly before US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo at the Pentagon.Seated across from Song, Mattis was asked by a reporter whether diplomatic solutions are off the table.\"No,\" he said flatly.Asked what additional diplomatic solutions could be taken, he responded, \"We're never out of diplomatic solutions. We continue to work together. The minister and I share a responsibility to provide for the protection of our nations, our populations, and our interests, which is what we're here to discuss today.\"The White House said in a new statement that Trump spoke by phone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier in the day, their second conversation since Tuesday's missile test.\u00a0\"The two leaders confirmed their continuing, close cooperation on efforts to address North Korea's launch of an intermediate range ballistic missile that overflew Japanese territory earlier this week,\" it said.On Tuesday, the UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting to discuss the launch. The council then issued a statement condemning the launch as an \"outrageous\" threat and urging Pyongyang to stop further nuclear tests or provocations.The US military, meanwhile, successfully tested a missile interception system off the coast of Hawaii early Wednesday. The USS John Paul Jones, a guided-missile destroyer, used StandardMissile-6 guided missiles to intercept a medium-range ballistic missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii, according to the US Missile Defense Agency.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to conduct more missile flights over Japan.During their talks, Song and Mattis agreed that a strong military option can enhance diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea, according to the South's defense ministry.Mattis, in particular, expressed the US commitment to providing a robust extended deterrence to the Asian ally and defending it from any North Korean attack with an effective and overwhelming response.\"The two ministers expressed their support for the current diplomatic efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, and at the same time stressed the fact that a strong, effective and credible military response option increases the credibility of the diplomatic efforts,\" the Ministry of National Defense said in a press release.Song and Mattis also agreed to accelerate efforts to enable an early transfer of wartime operational control of South Korean troops from Washington to Seoul and follow up during consultations in Seoul in October.They will accelerate talks to revise a bilateral missile guideline, the ministry said, in an apparent reference to Seoul's request for an increase in the maximum weight of ballistic missile payloads from 500 kilograms to 1 ton.It was Song's first meeting with Mattis since he took office last month.Later in the day, he met with White House National Security Adviser H.R.

In the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, up to 6,000 Koreans were killed by Japanese people agitated after the government spread a rumor that Koreans planned a riot, according to historians.Seven victims' families launched the first association devoted to the incident which has not received much attention, even in Korea, compared to other atrocities by imperial Japan. (Yonhap)\"It is deplorable that after this long time passed, the Korean government cannot even announce the identity of any single family of the victims,\" Oh Choong-kong, a Korean-Japanese producer of a documentary film about the tragedy, said during the ceremony at the state-run National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in the southeastern city of Busan. He lamented that there is no government body to investigate the incident. In 2014, 103 South Korean lawmakers proposed a bill to establish a committee to investigate the incident, but it was not passed.The bereaved families will campaign to urge the two governments to investigate the incident and find out who the victims were. They are also demanding that Japan send the remains of the victims home and compensate their families for their deaths.The organizers held a memorial service to pay tribute to the victims at a former port in the city where they left for Japan after Korea fell under Japan's colonial rule in 1910. On Sept. 1, 1923, the magnitude 7.9 earthquake flattened Tokyo, Yokohama and surrounding prefectures, leaving some 400,000 dead or missing. A spree of killings erupted when the Japanese government spread a rumor about a planned riot by Koreans in order to calm public anger.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"With the formation of the association, we will make efforts to have South Korea and Japan jointly bring light to the incident,\" Sumiko Yamamoto, who heads an executive committee to pay tribute to the massacre's victims in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture, said during the ceremony.

(Yonhap)","348":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for more weapons tests targeting the Pacific Ocean, Pyongyang announced Wednesday, a day after his nation for the first time flew a ballistic missile designed to carry a nuclear payload over Japan.Tuesday's aggressive missile launch _ likely the longest ever from North Korea _ over the territory of a close US ally sends a clear message of defiance as Washington and Seoul conduct war games nearby. Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said it was a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile that the North first successfully tested in May and threatened to fire into waters near Guam earlier this month.\u00a0 A pedestrian walks past a TV screen on a street displaying North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after North Korea's missile launch, in Tokyo, Japan, 29 August 2017. (EPA-Yonhap)Kim expressed \"great satisfaction\" over the launch that he called a \"meaningful prelude\" to containing Guam, which is home to key US military bases that North Korea finds threatening, the agency said. He also said the country will continue to watch \"US demeanors\" before it decides on future actions.Kim also said it's \"necessary to positively push forward the work for putting the strategic force on a modern basis by conducting more ballistic rocket launching drills with the Pacific as a target in the future.\"\u00a0 The launch seemed designed to show that North Korea can back up a threat to target the US territory of Guam, if it chooses to do so, while also establishing a potentially dangerous precedent that could see future missiles flying over Japan. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile traveled around 2,700 kilometers (1,677 miles) and reached a maximum height of 550 kilometers (341 miles) as it flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The KCNA said the flight test was a countermeasure to the Ulchi Freedom Guardian joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea that run through Thursday. Pyongyang views the annual war games between the allies as invasion rehearsals.\u00a0 In a statement, US President Donald Trump said North Korea had signaled its \"contempt for its neighbors\" and that \"all options are on the table\" in terms of a US response.Any new test worries Washington and its allies because it presumably puts North Korea a step closer to its goal of an arsenal of nuclear missiles that can reliably target the United States. Tuesday's test, however, looks especially aggressive to Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.North Korea has conducted launches at an unusually fast pace this year _ 13 times, Seoul says _ and some analysts believe it could have viable long-range nuclear missiles before the end of Trump's first term in early 2021. Seoul says that while North Korea has twice before fired rockets it said were carrying satellites over Japan _ in 1998 and 2009 _ it has never before used a ballistic missile, which is unambiguously designed for military strikes. North Korea also chose not to fire its most recent missile at a lofted angle, as it did in previous launches to avoid other countries, and Seoul's spy service said the North launched from an unusual spot: the international airport in its capital, Pyongyang. Some outside observers said launching a road-mobile missile from an airport runway could demonstrate the North's ability to fire its missiles from anywhere in the country. The launch is also another rebuke to Trump, who suggested last week that his tough approach to North Korea, which included threats to unleash \"fire and fury,\" meant Kim \"is starting to respect us.\"Tuesday's missile landed nowhere near Guam, but firing a Hwasong-12 so soon after the threat may be a way for North Korea to show it could follow through if it chose to do so. Guam is 3,400 kilometers (2,110 miles) away from North Korea, but South Korea's military said the North may have fired the missile at a shorter range.North Korea will no doubt be watching the world's reaction to see if it can use Tuesday's flight over Japan as a precedent for future launches. Trump said in his statement that \"threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world\" and that \"all options are on the table.\"Japanese officials made their usual strongly worded condemnations of the launch. \"We will do our utmost to protect people's lives,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. \"This reckless act of launching a missile that flies over our country is an unprecedented, serious and important threat.\"The launch was also condemned by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and a number of other countries. Tokyo said there was no reported damage from the missile. Residents on Hokkaido were warned of a North Korean missile launch by an alert on their cellphones, with loud alarms and an email that told people to stay indoors. Speakers broadcast an alert saying \"missile is passing, missile is passing.\" Tuesday's launch came days after North Korea fired what was assessed as three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, and a month after its second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say could reach deep into the US mainland when perfected. In an unusual move, the military in Seoul released videos of three South Korean missile tests conducted last week. They showed two types of new missiles with ranges of 800 kilometers (500 miles) and 500 kilometers (310 miles) being fired from truck-mounted launchers. South Korea's Agency for Defense Development said the launches represented the last flight test for the longer-range missile before it is operationally deployed. Such missiles, which would be the latest additions to South Korea's Hyumoo family of missiles, are considered key components of the so-called \"kill chain\" pre-emptive strike capability that South Korea is pursuing to counter North Korea's nuclear and missile threat.South Korea also said its air force conducted a live-fire drill involving four F-15 fighter jets dropping eight MK-84 bombs that accurately hit targets at a military field near the country's eastern coast. Yoon Young-chan, chief press secretary of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said the exercise was conducted after Moon directed the military to \"display a strong capability to punish\" North Korea if need be.\u00a0 (AP)","349":"The UN Security Council denounced North Korea's latest missile test Tuesday, unanimously demanding that Pyongyang halt the program after a rocket was fired over Japan into the Pacific.The 15-nation body maintained its unity after Kim Jong-Un's latest provocation, with China and Russia agreeing to sign up to a statement condemning his isolated regime's action.But the US-drafted statement, while noting that the test contravened several previous Security Council resolutions, will not immediately lead to new or tightened measures against Pyongyang.\u00a0Japan's UN Ambassador Koro Bessho exits a UN Security Council emergency meeting over North Korea's latest missile launch on August 29, 2017 at UN Headquarters in New York.

The JCS appears to be considering the projectile to be the Hwasong-12, an intermediate-range ballistic missile successfully tested last May, though a detailed analysis is under way. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera shared the view at a meeting with reporters in Tokyo, citing the missile\u2019s flight distance and other features. \u201cWe assess at this point that it was of the midrange ballistic missile class,\u201d a military official here told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. \u201cWe believe the provocation was to stage a show of force against the South Korea-US Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise, show off its capability to strike US bases and create strategic circumstances that are in favor of themselves,\u201d the official said, referring to the ongoing joint military drill.In the May experiment, the Hwasong-12 was fired at a sharp angle, traveling around 780 kilometers and reaching a maximum altitude of 2,110 kilometers, which means its range may hover from 4,500-5,000 kilometers. This time, however, the North did not launch it at a regular angle -- for its first time for an IRBM and apparently to examine its re-entry technology in a more actual combat environment -- the official said.\u00a0 People walk by a TV news program reporting North Korea's missile launch, in Tokyo, Tuesday. (AP-Yonhap)If confirmed true, the choice of the missile could also reflect the Kim Jong-un regime\u2019s resolve to highlight that it is capable of realizing its recent threats to strike Guam, some 3,300 kilometers away, with the Hwasong-12. Japan\u2019s NHK TV also reported the missile separated into three parts, triggering speculation that the North may have used a multi-warhead vehicle. Kim Dong-yub, a former Navy officer and now professor at Kyungnam University\u2019s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said together with the Hwasong-12, there is the possibility that the missile was the Hwasong-10 or Pukguksong-2, each capable of flying about 3,500 kilometers and 2,000 kilometers. \u201cGiven the previous threat, it\u2019s highly possible the North fired the Hwasong-12 to show what it is capable of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the report on the missile\u2019s separation means that it carried multiple warheads, which I don\u2019t think is really likely, \u2026 or that it was a two-stage propellant missile -- the Hwasong-10 or Pukguksong-2 -- rather than the single-stage Hwasong-12.\u201dAnother striking element is that the launch took place at an airfield in Sunan, where Pyongyang International Airport is located, which would help speed up the preparations and make it harder to be spotted such as from a satellite. Seoul\u2019s National Intelligence Service said it was the first time that North Korea launched a missile at an airport. \u201cIt takes time when you set up a launcher at a normal battlefield, but an airfield is built with asphalt pavement so it would boost mobility while taking more time for us to detect it. It was a bold choice for Kim Jong-un,\u201d Rep. Lee Wan-young of the Liberty Korea Party told reporters after a closed-door briefing by the spy agency. He added that the NIS said it could not be verified whether the re-entry was successful.(Ministry of National Defense)The test quickly dampened cautious optimism that Pyongyang could defuse tension and move toward talks especially after it carried out relatively less intense short-range missile launches Saturday. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have since separately relayed hopes for a shift in North Korea\u2019s current course of action in the near future. President Moon Jae-in, who has been nonetheless talking about the need to revive dialogue, instructed the National Security Council to convene shortly after the liftoff and the military to demonstrate its \u201coverwhelming capability of punishing the North,\u201d his press secretary Yoon Young-chan said. Less than two hours later, the Air Force carried out a live-bombing drill in Gangwon Province near the eastern inter-Korean frontier. Four F-15K fighters dropped eight 1-ton MK-84 bombs, precisely hitting the target designed as Pyongyang\u2019s leadership, the Air Force said in a statement. The Agency for Defense Development, a state-run weapons maker, released rare footage of its final tests last week of newly built 800-kilometer and 500-kilometer ballistic missiles. The 500-kilometer missile, in particular, is key to \u201caccurately penetrating and destroying core facilities all over North Korea,\u201d the ADD said. South Korea and the US are also considering an additional display of force here involving US strategic assets such as the B-1B strategic bomber. Chung Eui-yong, chief of the National Security Office, had phone conversations with US national security adviser H.R.

(AFP)","360":"Gyeonggi Province plans to give cash subsidies to young people working for small- and medium- enterprises as early as this year, in a bid to tackle chronic labor shortages in the SME sector as well as soaring youth unemployment. The plan, consisting of three sub-packages, is to benefit a total of 130,000 residents between the ages of 18 to 34, who work more than 36 hours a week for SMEs headquartered in the province.\u00a0 Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil\u201cThe new policy will support the long-term employment of SME workers and help attract a fresh batch of laborers into the SME sector,\u201d said Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil during a press conference held earlier this year to unveil the measures. The governor noted that the main goal of the measures is to alleviate the wage gap between SMEs and big companies -- the key reason why young workers shun SME jobs and SME employers fail to retain talent.According to a recent study by the Korea Small Business Institute, the average pay of SME workers in manufacturing is just 54.9 percent of what their peers in big companies earn. Among the three packages, the monthly subsidy plan entails provision for up to two years of 300,000 won ($268) directly to 20,000 workers whose monthly wage is 2 million won or less. This is 7.2 million won in total per person, translating to at least a 15 percent increase in salary, Gyeonggi officials explained. The province will establish a welfare credit point system that enables recipients, numbering 100,000, to collect bonuses worth 800,000 won to 1.2 million won per year, as SME jobs tend to lack in fringe benefits. In addition, the province plans to introduce a special pension program for SME workers, on top of the existing retirement pension scheme. The 10-year program will have subscribers pay 100,000 won to 300,000 won into the fund every month, which will be matched by the same amount of contribution from the province. Subscribers for this 10-year pension plan are limited at 10,000 who earn less than 2.5 million won per month. Beneficiaries of these three programs will be selected based on their income level. A worker cannot apply for more than one program. \u201cThese policies will help strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs, which will then lead to new quality jobs for workers. It would create a virtuous circle,\u201d Nam stressed. Province officials said the three measures are designed to address the crippling factors in the SME employment as much as possible -- low pay, long hours and a lack of employment benefits. Without measures on these factors, a job policy won\u2019t fix the SME job mismatch. The province will establish a special unit to oversee the program\u2019s successful implementation. Nam said the new job policy signals a shift in Gyeonggi\u2019s welfare approach from universal welfare to \u201ctargeted\u201d welfare. He stressed with the South Korean population greying rapidly and an anticipated hike in welfare demand, universal welfare should be replaced by a more efficient model that can reduce fiscal burden. The Moon Jae-in administration has been making efforts to invigorate the SME industry by setting up a new ministry dedicated to supporting smaller companies and creating more jobs in July, as part of its five-year policy road map. The average monthly wage of SME workers stood at 3.23 million won in 2016, or 62.9 percent of 5.13 million won paid to employees working for large enterprises, showed a report by the think tank Korea Small Business Institute. The ratio of long-term unemployed people to the total jobless in South Korea reached an 18-year high in July, according to Statistics Korea in August.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)","361":"The message \"It's not Pyongyang but PyeongChang\" has been appearing in promotional materials for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, according to officials at the state-run Korean Culture and Information Service.For the South Korean service tasked with the mission of promoting Korean culture overseas and helping to upgrade the country's national image, the message has been necessary to help some visitors to the Olympics avoid confusing the host city of PyeongChang with the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.In October 2014, a Kenyan member of the Maasai tribe who planned to attend a United Nations conference in PyeongChang accidentally went to Pyongyang before leaving North Korea and boarding the correct flight to South Korea's Incheon International Airport. The man, Daniel Olomae Ole Sapit, was quoted as saying, \"There's a lot of confusion between the two.\"The KOCIS officials had been worried that the similarity of the two names, coupled with the much higher level of the North Korean capital's international recognition, could cause visitors to mistake the South Korean ski town for Pyongyang.As part of ways to distinguish the South Korean host city from the North Korean capital, PyeongChang has opted to capitalize the \"c\" in its name.With the Olympics just over five months away, the KOCIS officials said they are no longer afraid, as their efforts to publicize the Olympics overseas have paid off, and they are confident South Korea's first Winter Olympics will be a success.

The King Sejong Institute Foundation, the operator of the institutes, has said it is screening a promotional video for the PyeongChang Olympics in Korean cultural classes at 174 institutes in 58 countries around the world.A video, made by the KOCIS and released in July to celebrate the 200-day countdown to the 2018 Winter Olympics, has already garnered more than 8 million views. The video features South Korean magician Yu Ho-jin, who became the first magician from Asia to win the top prize at the International Federation of Magic Societies World Championship of Magic in 2012.High-profile personalities who have been designated as promotional ambassadors for the international sports event include soprano Jo Su-mi; Taeyang, a member of boy group Big Bang; the girl group Girl's Day; comedian Kim Byung-man; and former English Premier League player Park Ji-sung.Other outlets that the KOCIS is using for making pitches for the sports event are overseas broadcasters and news organizations.The US broadcaster NBC, the rights holder for broadcasting the Olympics in the United States, aired video clips on the Olympics through its program \"Today Show\" in March to April and will feature the sports event in the broadcaster's weekly travel and lifestyle television program in October.Promotional videos on the Olympics have been aired on other broadcasters, including CNN, Eurosport, Fox Sports, Fuji TV, America TV, and Vietnamese and Chinese ones.The KOCIS, which has also arranged for the coverage of the Olympics by news organizations from 40 countries, plans to invite an additional 60 journalists from overseas to the Olympics by December.Other events implemented by the KOCIS include a tour of the venues involving journalists at foreign news organizations in South Korea and the release of Olympics-related ads through overseas major broadcasters to mark the 100-day countdown to the Olympics.An official at the KOCIS said festivals and events held following the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics have given the country opportunities to tout itself as a well-off country. \"But through the Olympics this time, we plan to instill the world with a message that the country has grown up well thanks to its help, and it's about time for us to give new dreams and possibilities back to the world,\" the official said.

The step from producing 6-ton motors to 20-ton motors requires seven to 10 years, he said.\"North Korea might be able to shorten the timeframe by a few years by taking shortcuts and accepting reductions in performance and reliability,\" he wrote in the article. \"But given the country's relative inexperience with solid-propellant production, an ICBM founded on solid-fuels is unlikely to be fielded within a decade.\"The reclusive state has continued to aggravate security concerns in Seoul and Washington with its evolving nuclear and missile programs. Its two ICBM tests last month reaffirmed it is on course in the development of a nuclear-tipped ICBM, which Seoul views as a \"red line.\"In his article, Elleman analyzed a large filament-wound composite vessel shown in the North Korean leader's inspection photo.The expert explained that the large bronze-colored vessel -- whose size is roughly 1.4-1.5 meters in diameter -- is an advanced, light-weight casing designed to house solid propellant. He also pointed to a filament-winding machine in the photo, which is presumably used to manufacture the composite-motor casing.Solid-fueled rocket motors consist of a casing, solid propellant, ignitor and other components, he said.\"It is unclear if the machine can produce motor casings larger than a 1.5 meter diameter. If not, North Korea will need to acquire a larger winding machine to produce motor casings large enough to power intercontinental ballistic missiles,\" he said.The expert also explained the conceptual illustrations of the two missiles shown in the photo -- the Pukguksong-3 and Hwasong-13. The Puguksong-3 missile seems to be an advanced version of the solid-fuel Pukguksong-1 and 2, he said. \"If North Korea masters the production processes, maintains a reliable supply chain for the filaments and resins needed to create the cases, and adheres to strict quality control procedures, the Pukguksong-3 might be capable of reaching targets 2,000 kilometers away,\" he said, noting the present reach of the Pukguksong-1 and 2 stands at around 1,200 km.

People watch a TV screen showing Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong's arrival for his verdict hearing at the Seoul Central District Court, Aug. 25, 2017. (Photo credit: Yonhap)The controversial deal, which combined Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T; to give birth to the new Samsung C&T;, is being contested at court by minority shareholder Ilsung Pharmaceuticals, which is seeking to invalidate the deal. Ilsung, which held a 2.11 percent stake in the before-merger C&T;, filed the suit in March 2016, claiming the deal strengthened Lee\u2019s equity control over the conglomerate at the expense of minority shareholders. The Seoul Central District Court on Friday found Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee guilty of bribing the now-ousted President Park Geun-hye to earn political support for the merger deal. Lee was sentenced to five years in jail. In a separate case, the same court earlier ruled the then-health minister guilty of pressuring the National Pension Service, the single largest shareholder of C&T;, to vote in favor of the deal. Friday\u2019s court ruling is expected to have an impact on the pending case on the merger deal, with minority shareholders saying it unduly aided Lee, the only son of the group\u2019s ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee, in the succession process. Samsung attorneys say the merger was to drive growth. The court had earlier delayed a decision on whether to invalidate the merger, as Lee\u2019s trial was ongoing. The court is expected to rule in October. The deal was highly controversial at that time. Elliott Management, a US-based hedge fund which had launched a high-profile campaign to block the deal, also filed a similar suit but settled with Samsung in March. Also in a separate suit last year, the Seoul High Court ruled the deal greatly undervalued Samsung C&T; and overvalued Cheil Industries. Lee was the largest stakeholder in Cheil Industries. The Supreme Court is to make a final judgement on that. How this merger litigation will play out will remain as one of the most pressing concerns for the group, which alone generates one fifth of South Korea\u2019s gross domestic product, with its nominal chairman, the senior Lee, hospitalized since 2014 and the de facto chief, the young Lee, in jail. The junior Lee has been behind bars since February, implicated in a massive scandal that led to the former president\u2019s expulsion from power. The former leader is currently standing trial on a total of 18 charges. Lee Jae-yong was found guilty on all five charges -- bribery, embezzlement, concealment of criminal proceeds, illegal transfer of assets overseas and perjury. Samsung lawyers said he will appeal.

The term was briefly mentioned only at the one-on-one meeting at the end,\" the official said.\"I think it's a good signal,\" the official said. (Yonhap)Another good sign was that the summit lasted one hour longer than scheduled as the two sides made joint efforts to restore trust, the official said.During the summit, Moon and Xi agreed on four basic principles in dealing with North Korea's nuclear threat: No war on the Korean Peninsula, denuclearization of the peninsula, peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue and improvement in inter-Korean relations.The official said that the principles do not conflict with the US position.\"Military options are to back up diplomatic and peaceful means,\" the official said. \"Peaceful and diplomatic resolution is the official US position and I believe the agreement on the four major principles is not different from the US position.\"With regard to Chinese security guards' beating of South Korean photojournalists, the official said that Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha expressed \"strong regret\" to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. \"I wish the injured journalists have a quick recovery,\" the official said. \"Something that can't happen has happened.\"Moon also directed his top security advisor Chung Eui-yong to pay a visit to the journalists and take necessary measures, the official said.\"I think we can talk about follow-up measures after finding out how this happened,\" the official said.The violence happened Thursday ahead of the summit when the Chinese guards blocked Korean photographers from following Moon visiting various booths at a trade fair in Beijing involving hundreds of South Korean firms and prospective Chinese buyers.As the journalists protested the blockage, security guards took one of them outside of the venue and beat him up despite strong protests from his colleagues and South Korean officials, including those from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.He was taken to a hospital after Moon's medical staff examined him and said he required intensive treatment. Another photojournalist was also injured in an earlier incident where he was pushed back by a different group of security guards at the same venue.Some Korean media have also raised criticism of the Chinese foreign minister for tapping Moon on the arm, saying it could be considered a diplomatic gaffe.

But they often struggle to make a living in the capitalist South and sometimes fail to adjust to their new lives.Dressmaker Kim Ryon-Hui arrived seven years ago but has since has made several desperate attempts to return to her family -- including forging a passport, for which she was imprisoned, and falsely confessing to espionage in the hope she would be expelled.\"I'm a citizen of Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea,\" Kim told dozens of reporters at a briefing in Seoul by Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN's Special Rapporteur on human rights in the North. (Yonhap)\"I have been forcefully detained in the South for seven years,\" she added.Kim accused Seoul of violating her human rights, saying it had prevented her from going back to her aging parents and daughter.\"A mother is someone who can't be apart from her daughter for even a moment, but seven years just hurts too much,\" she said, her voice trembling, adding she had attempted suicide.Most North Korean defectors are issued a South Korean passport six months after arrival, but Kim still has not received one and said the South's intelligence services had told her she \"might escape to the North\".South Koreans need government permission -- which is only granted in exceptional circumstances -- to go to the North, with which the country is technically still at war.Pyongyang repeatedly cites Kim's case and has said it will not allow any more reunions of relatives divided by the Korean War until she -- and 12 North Korean waitresses who it says were kidnapped from a restaurant in China -- are returned.The divided families are one of the most emotive outcomes of the conflict, which saw the peninsula partitioned in 1953, with around 60,000 increasingly elderly South Koreans still hoping to meet their relatives again.Quintana said the case was an example of the \"absurd cost of division\".The North is accused by the UN and many other countries of widespread human rights violations and Quintana said social and economic structures that fulfil ordinary people's rights and needs had largely \"disappeared\".\"What remains intact is the comprehensive system of control and surveillance over the population,\" he said.There was also a \"widening gap in living standards between Pyongyang residents and the majority of the population\". \"It is alarming that this situation occurs in a country that is devoting a vast proportion of its resources to its defence budget and strengthening its border controls in unprecedented ways,\" he added.\"The order of priorities in the DPRK requires a major shift that recognises the urgency to fulfil the basic needs of the population.

These efforts are a critical component of the DPRK human rights agenda as they serve to not just hold those responsible to account, but also to deter policies that violate human rights and to provide victims with avenues for seeking legal remedy,\" the special rapporteur noted.\u00a0 (Yonhap)In its report to the UN General Assembly in 2014, the UN Commission of Inquiry, which led an investigation into the North Korean human rights situation, recommended the Security Council refer the case to the ICC.\"Let's not forget that one important recommendation of the human rights framework of the UN is to ask the Security Council to refer the case of DPRK to the ICC and that recommendation is still alive,\" he said, calling North Korea by the acronym for its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \"It is the responsibility of the Security Council to properly consider.\"\u00a0 Quintana also added that the human rights issue should be part of the agenda for any future talks with North Korea. \"While I am encouraged by the possibility that diplomatic talks with the DPRK on the issue of denuclearization may resume in the near future, I also wish to emphasize that human rights should be an essential part of this agenda,\" according to him.Quintana also urged the UN Security Council to be wary of any reverse impact on the livelihood of common North Koreans when it imposes and implement economic sanctions over the country's nuclear and missile developments.\"Let me here recall the need to design and implement international sanctions in a way that considers their potential adverse impact on human rights and on economic livelihood.\"He also pointed to North Korea's unprecedented ratio of defense costs and increased border controls, which further bite into the livelihood of its citizens.\"What I find particularly worrisome is the widening gap in living standards between Pyongyang residents and the majority of the population. It is alarming that this situation occurs in a country that is devoting a vast proportion of its resources to its defense budget and strengthening its border controls in unprecedented ways,\" he said, adding that a major shift is required in North Korea to fulfill the basic needs of the population.

The panel also said that unification policies should be codified, and that the Ministry of Unification should be given more independence and its views given more weight in setting related policies.\u00a0 The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea viewed from Paju, Gyeonggi Province on Thursday. Yonhap\u201cContrary to the former administration\u2019s announcement, it has been confirmed that (former) President Park Geun-hye ordered (South Korean entities) to withdraw from the Kaesong complex on Feb. 8, before the National Security Council meeting on Feb. 10,\u201d the panel said. According to the panel, Park\u2019s Foreign Policy Secretary Kim Kyu-hyun informed then-Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo of Park\u2019s decision to shut the complex down on Feb. 8. The NSC, led by former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin at the time, convened later in the day. Related plans were drawn up and announced on Feb. 10. The Park administration had said that the decision was made by the NSC on Feb. 10. The complex was shut down in response to North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test and long-range missile launch conducted on Jan. 6 and Feb. 7, respectively. The panel, however, said that it was unable to verify how Park came to make the decision or if she discussed the issue with others. It has been alleged that Choi Soon-sil, who is accused of meddling in state affairs, was involved in the decision. The panel\u2019s report also said that the Park administration\u2019s claim that North Korea was using Kaesong employees\u2019 wages for the development of nuclear weapons lacked evidence. \u201c(The claim) lacked solid information or sufficient grounds, and was inserted by Cheong Wa Dae without consulting the concerned organizations,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe documents referenced at the time were based on circumstantial evidence, and based on defectors\u2019 testimonies, and therefore lacked credibility and objectivity.\u201dThe panel also raised issues with the execution of the measure, saying that the closing of the complex did not follow legal procedures and that the government neglected to protect South Korean investors\u2019 assets. \u201cLegal basis for compensating losses sustained by businesses (involved in inter-Korean) economic cooperation projects should be established, and an insurance system for economic cooperation and trade should be improved,\u201d the panel said. The panel also said that the government needs to prepare for the reopening of the complex if conditions are met, and called for prohibiting the government from using North Korea-related information for political ends. \u201cNorth Korea intelligence being used politically must be prohibited,\u201d the panel said, citing information regarding the defections of Thae Young-ho and a group of North Korean restaurant employees. Thae is a former North Korean diplomat who defected to the South in August. He is the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to have fled the regime. The mass defection by North Korean restaurant employees took place in April, and the information was revealed four days ahead of the April 13 general election last year. At the time, 13 North Koreans working at a Beijing restaurant operated by the North Korean government fled to the South.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (EPA-Yonhap)Tillerson said Tuesday that the US was \"ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk\" and willing to have the first meeting \"without precondition.\"\"Let's just meet. We can talk about the weather if you want,\" he told a forum at the Atlantic Council think tank.It was widely interpreted as a departure from US demands that North Korea first halt its nuclear and missile testing and demonstrate its sincerity about denuclearization.Just two weeks earlier, the communist regime test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile it claimed was capable of carrying a nuclear weapon to all parts of the US mainland.That initially dashed hopes for a resumption of dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang, which had sprung out of a 75-day pause in provocations from the North. US officials had said a pause of 60 days would send a signal of Pyongyang's interest in talks.\"I think Secretary Tillerson's remarks could have been potentially helpful because they would have clarified publicly that the US is willing to engage with North Korea without preconditions,\" said Frank Aum, senior expert on North Korea for the US Institute of Peace.\"Making this statement publicly also would have put the US on the high ground and put the ball back in North Korea's court, giving them the responsibility of accepting or rejecting a peaceful overture,\" said Aum, a contributor to 38 North, a North Korea monitoring website.But the White House was terse. In a statement, it said the president's views on North Korea \"have not changed.\"It \"seemed to undercut Tillerson's message and, even worse, undermined Tillerson as the nation's top diplomat,\" according to Aum.Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, offered his interpretation: \"I suspect Trump may have been irked that anyone was getting attention other than himself.\"The current US policy of \"maximum pressure\" through sanctions and diplomatic isolation will probably continue, but the tactics may become more flexible, he added.Pak was more concerned about the \"mixed messaging\" from the Trump administration.That \"undermines US credibility and creates conditions for a miscalculation that could lead to an unintended conflict,\" she said.

Cheong Seong-chang, senior fellow at Sejong Institute, said Pyongyang is likely to carry out the seventh nuclear test and another intercontinental ballistic missile test in 2018 as there is a \u201clong way to go\u201d for Pyongyang to reach the ultimate goal of acquiring nuclear weapons to strike the US mainland. \u201cThere is no reasons for North Korea to begin talks now,\u201c said Cheong in a security forum hosted by Sejong Institute, a security think tank in Seoul. \u201cIn the foreseeable future, the prospect of direct talks amounts to zero.\u201d North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gives a speech in this undated photo released by the Korean Central News Agency (Yonhap)On Tuesday in Washington, US State Secretary Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without preconditions, a proposal appeared to deviate from Washington\u2019s previous stance that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear arsenal for any negotiations to take place. While the latest launch of Hwasong-15 ICBM-class missile showed \u201ctechnological progress,\u201d Pyongyang still needs to show more advanced nuclear-strike capability against the US and they would detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific next year to achieve the goal, Cheong said. The airborne nuclear test over the Pacific would present a \u201cserious test\u201d to US President Donald Trump, who had said he would never tolerate North Korea\u2019s capability to attack the US and pursue military options to prevent it, said David Straub, a former State Department diplomat. Straub, who now works as a fellow at Sejong Institute, noted that the risk of using military force on the Korean Peninsula is \u201cimpossible to fathom,\u201d but if Trump shows his reluctance on the military option, it would also raise doubts about the US role in the region.\u201cIf the US uses its military force on the Korean Peninsula pre-emptively, it would bring a disastrous impact on the US stance in the region. But, then again, if Trump fails to make a decisive action, his leadership and the US role would be thrown into the question,\u201d he wrote in his report. Still, a pre-emptive strike on North Korea is a \u201cfar-fetched\u201d idea as it could invite massive retaliation from the North and escalate into an all-out war on the peninsula, said Lee Sang-hyun, senior research fellow at Sejong Institute. Regardless whether the pre-emptive attacks could become a \u201csurgical strike\u201d on nuclear and missile facilities or \u201cmultiple strikes\u201d combined with cyberattacks, any military action runs the risk of causing another major conflict on the peninsula as North Korea is \u201crisk-acceptant.\u201d \u201cThe likelihood of carrying out a pre-emptive strike can change depending on circumstances,\u201d said Jin Chang-Soo, Director of Sejong Institute. \u201cIt depends upon what kinds of provocations North Korea would conduct and what sort of intention they have.\u201dBy Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","378":"The biting cold continued nationwide Wednesday, recording lows of minus 17 to minus 2 degrees Celsius in the morning.

The panel was launched by Seoul's unification ministry in September.The Park administration shut down the factory zone, just north of the inter-Korean border, in response to North Korea's fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in 2016. The move put an end to the last symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.\"It is verified that the closure was decided by the president's unilateral verbal order without discussions and consultations at the official decision-making level,\" the report showed.The former government said that the shutdown was decided at a National Security Council meeting on Feb. 10, 2016, right before the announcement. But the report showed that Park made the order two days earlier.It also said that the closure is a decision that transcends law, adding that even a political decision amid a security crisis should be made within the boundary of law and under legal procedures.At that time, the ministry said that the decision was aimed at preventing money generated by the factory park from bankrolling North Korea's nuclear and missile development.

(Yonhap)But the panel said that there is no sufficient information or evidence to support the claim that funds from the complex had been used for other purposes.\"This hampers the legitimacy of the government's decision and limits Seoul's future stance over the resumption of the Kaesong complex,\" the report showed.The report failed to clear up speculation that Choi Soon-sil, the now-jailed long-time friend of Park, might have been behind the closure. The former government dismissed the allegations.Choi was at the center of the corruption scandal that led to Park's impeachment in December 2016 and ouster earlier this year.The report is likely to rekindle a row over under what conditions the operation of the Kaesong complex can be resumed.The liberal Moon Jae-in government is seeking better inter-Korean ties and engagement with Pyongyang though it now focuses on employing sanctions and pressure on the North over its nuclear programs.Seoul said the resumption of the industrial park would hinge on progress in the resolution of North Korea's nuclear and missile problems.\"With implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions on the North, we need to re-open the Kaesong park and to actively prepare for it if certain conditions are met due to changes in the global political landscape,\" the report added.The committee, meanwhile, added that intelligence on North Korea should not be politically used, saying that the government broke the practice of not revealing details about defections by North Koreans.Last year, the ministry announced that 12 North Korean female workers at a Chinese restaurant en masse and Thae Yong-ho, a former diplomat stationed in the North's embassy in Britain, defected to the South.\"The ministry passively made the announcement at the request of Seoul's spy agency. It is identified that the ministry was not even aware of details about intelligence well,\" Im Seong-taek, a lawyer and panel member, told a briefing.The panel also stressed that the issue of humanitarian assistance should be separately handled from political considerations and civilian inter-Korean exchanges need to be encouraged.A joint tour program at Mount Kumgang in North Korea has been suspended since 2008, when a South Korean tourist was killed by a North Korean soldier there. Seoul also imposed sanctions banning inter-Korean exchanges in May 2010 to punish North Korea's sinking of a South Korean warship.The panel's review came as the Moon government is seeking to set a North Korea policy that can survive through succeeding administrations regardless of their ideology. It said that South Korea's inter-Korean policy should be made based on public consensus and law and in a consistent manner.The ministry said it will take into account the panel's policy recommendations in setting its policy on North Korea and unification.

It is home to the 7th Fleet, the US Navy\u2019s largest forward-deployed armada. Led by its command ship USS Blue Ridge, an impressive collection of guided missile cruisers and destroyers were docked at the base, ready to scramble at any moment\u2019s notice. Sailors and workers were busy carrying equipment and unloading cargo across the 3-kilometer waterfront road at Tokyo Bay.\u00a0 The USS Curtis Wilbur destroyer is anchored at the dock in Yokosuka naval base. (Yeo Jun-suk\/The Korea Herald)Although the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Regan was nowhere to be seen, the whole dock was crowded with US battleships. Some of them were under the repair, including a USS Fitzgerald destroyer that collided with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel in June. \u201cIf the missile launch were a real-world scenario and escalated into the war, the whole ships would have scrambled right away. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier would have been called upon immediately,\u201d said a South Korean military official who accompanied South Korean journalists on a visit here. The Yokosuka base was part of the Korean media group\u2019s five-day itinerary to the US forces in Japan and UN-designated bases here. Yokosuka is one of the seven UN-designated bases. The main purpose of the trip was to check on the force flow and logistical support in the event of contingency on the Korean Peninsula. Also docked here were Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruisers \u2013 such as USS Antietam, USS Chancellorsville and USS USS Shiloh. Several aegis-equipped US destroyers and Japanese submarines from the Self-Defense Forces were spotted.\u00a0The reporters were granted rare access to USS Curtis Wilbur, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer. Equipped with Tomahawk missile and Aegis systems, the ship participated in missile warning exercises involving South Korea, Japan and the US, including the one in March.

UNC headquarters relocated to Seoul from Tokyo in 1957. Such roles are enshrined in the US-Japan Security Cooperation Treaty. Its Article V and VI stipulate that the US obligation to defend Japan from \u201ccommon danger\u201d and Japan\u2019s obligation to provide US access to its facilities and territories. \u201cUnited Nations Command and UNC-Rear Command is basically US organizations. They are virtually activated under the US law,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, professor of National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Japan. Among the first units to be dispatched to the Korean peninsula is the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Forces. Headquartered at Futenma base in Okinawa, the forces are able to rapidly conduct operations from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to amphibious assault and high-intensity combat. When the reporters visited the Futenma base, dozens of attack aircraft and transport helicopters were spotted at the 3-kilometer-long airfield. Among them were V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military aircraft and CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters. Military officials said with the help of those assets, the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Forces can be dispatched to South Korea within 24 hours in the event of contingency. Among the 54,000-strong US military personnel in Japan, 28,000 belong to the expeditionary forces. \u201cCurrently, the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Forces are dispatching troops to the combined Korea-US exercise almost every three weeks,\u201d said a military official from the South Korean Marine Forces. \u201cThey are possibly the most agile unit.\u201d Enabling their mission is the United Nations Forces in Japan.

Its number is much higher than the 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea.There is one lingering concern in South Korea over the role of Japanese troops when it comes to the contingency on the peninsula -- What if Japan works with the US to devise a preemptive strike plot against North Korea without the consent of the South Korean government? \u201cThe Japanese troops don\u2019t have capability to conduct a preemptive strikes. For example, it is not able to carry out an operation of Suppression of Enemy Air Defense against North Korea,\u201d said Michishita. \u201cJapan doesn\u2019t have the capability to conduct combined military operations with the US.\u201dBy Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","390":"A senior UN official has visited a children's food factory and a hospital in Pyongyang during his high-profile trip to the reclusive country, the North's state media reported Friday.Jeffrey Feltman, the undersecretary general for political affairs at the United Nations, toured the Pyongyang Children's Foodstuff Factory and then the Breast Tumour Institute of the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital and Preventive Hospital No. 3 of the Ministry of Public Health, the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.\u00a0(Yonhap)Feltman arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday for a four-day visit.

Securing a strong deterrence against North Korea is a way of expressing our firm determination that we will not allow North Korean provocations or another war on the Korean Peninsula,\" the president told the meeting, according to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports.Building up the country's defense capability may require acquiring or developing new advanced military weapons, the president noted.In a bilateral summit held last month in Seoul, Moon and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed to speed up Seoul's acquisition or development of new and advanced strategic military assets as a way of building its own measures to counter North Korean provocations.Such assets may include nuclear-powered submarines, which are considered an answer to North Korea's submarine-launched ballistic missiles.Building up the country's own defense capabilities also requires having control over its own military, President Moon insisted.\"Second, we must quickly meet the conditions for the transfer of the wartime operational control of our military based on a strong South Korea-US alliance.

Inter-Korean relations have since worsened seriously under the two successive conservative administrations of Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye.Despite the nuclear and missile tensions, Lee said that Seoul should make efforts next year to restore dialogue channels with the North and foster an atmosphere for talks so that a summit can take place the following year.\"Even in the middle of a situation dominated by nuclear and missile provocations and sanctions, we need to have a flexible strategy so as to induce dialogue and negotiations,\" Lee said. \"We have to encourage North Korea's participation in efforts to make the PyeongChang Olympics a peace Olympics and suspend military exercises during the period to create an atmosphere for dialogue.\"Seoul should consider sending a special envoy to the North to ask for its participation in the Winter Olympics, Lee said. He also said that the two Koreas should restore a hotline to prevent accidental military clashes.

The city in North Jeolla Province will hold committee meetings to discuss the issue later this month, before giving a permit to start the construction. It is predicted that the plan will face some opposition from the residents around the site.\u00a0 (Yonhap)Currently, many animal corpses are put in standard plastic garbage bags, as there are not many animal funeral halls. There isn\u2019t any animal funeral hall in the city of Jeonju, two hours south of Seoul by drive. Pet funerals in Korea are similar to human funerals. A funeral car visits the home and carries the body to the funeral hall. A traditional Korean funeral process is followed, or cremation is done. The funeral usually costs around 200,000 won ($180). An official from the city government said, \u201cThe permit will be given if the business conditions are fit, but residents\u2019 opinion cannot be ignored. The committee will look into the construction plan with consideration.\u201d By Im Eun-byel (silverstar@heraldcorp.com)","403":"The 2018 government budget passed Tuesday, with social security, defense, education and central and local administration spending receiving the biggest bumps. Of next year\u2019s 428.8 trillion won ($392 billion) budget, about one-third, or 144.7 trillion won, has been allocated to areas concerning social security -- welfare, health and labor. The figure is an increase of 11.7 percent from this year, while the overall budget was increased by about 7 percent.\u00a0 Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon addresses the National Assembly in the early hours of Wednesday after the budget was approved. YonhapThe budget allocated to education-related areas was increased by 11.8 percent to 64.2 trillion won, while that for central and local governance was raised by 8.9 percent to 69 trillion won. Of the social security budget, 63.15 trillion won is allocated to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which will oversee some of the Moon administration\u2019s key welfare pledges, including higher basic pensions and child subsidies. Under a budget approved by the parliament, the universal child care subsidy promised by Moon will now exclude the top 10 percent of earners, and will be rolled out from September, instead of July as planned by the government. Along with the child care subsidies, plans for raising the basic pension to 250,000 won a month have been pushed back to September, from the originally planned April. The funding for \u201cMoon Jae-in Care\u201d -- an expansion of national health care envisioned by President Moon Jae-in -- has been cut by 220 billion won to 5.2 trillion won. The Ministry of Employment and Labor will also get a massive boost in its budget next year, in large part to finance Moon\u2019s drive to raise the minimum wage. The ministry will be allocated nearly 23.8 trillion won next year, up 27.6 percent, or 5.14 trillion won, from this year.The bulk of the increase will be used to subsidize small businesses -- those with under 30 employees -- to lessen the impact of the minimum wage hike. Next year\u2019s minimum wage has been set at 7,530 won per hour, up 16.4 percent from this year, and Moon hopes to raise the figure to 10,000 won during his term. The country\u2019s defense budget was given the largest year-on-year boost in nine years, rising 7 percent from this year to 43.2 trillion won. The large increase has fueled in large part by the drive to improve South Korea\u2019s military capabilities, in particular those aimed at countering North Korea\u2019s missile threats. With North Korea continuing its missile and nuclear weapons programs, Moon has emphasized the need to secure \u201coverwhelming power\u201d to keep the regime in check. Under the plans, the government is pushing to complete the establishment of the \u201cthree-axis\u201d defense platform \u2013 the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike system, Korean Air and Missile Defense system and Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation scheme -- by the early 2020s. While the Ministry of Environment\u2019s budget is to be reduced, it has been given more than 140 billion won for projects that aim to improve water quality for the \u201cfour big rivers.\u201d The Han, Nakdong, Yeongsan and Geum rivers were subjected to extensive construction work during the Lee Myung-bak administration. Environmental groups argue the projects caused significant environmental damage in the areas. Influenced by the recent earthquake that shook Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, the parliament raised the budget for such disaster projects. The earthquake-related budget approved by the parliament is 127.9 billion won higher than that drawn up by the government. Projects to be funded by government budget include research on faults, measures for quakes and tsunamis and reinforcing buildings of state-run universities and urban rail networks.

(Yonhap)\u201cThe government expresses regret over the implementation report that Japan recently submitted as part of its follow-up measures on the world heritage listing of its modern industrial facilities,\u201d Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a commentary issued in the name of its spokesman.\u201cThe government urges Japan to take measures sincerely and swiftly as it promised the international community to remember the victims of its forced hard labor,\u201d it added.The commentary follows Tokyo\u2019s decision to submit an 851-page report to UNESCO, which pushes for the installation of an information center for modern industrial facilities in Tokyo. Among Japan\u2019s 23 facilities designated as UNESCO World Heritage in July 2015, seven were involved in its mobilization of forced labor from Korea and other Asian nations before and during World War II, including the famous Hashima Island. Japan\u2019s capital city of Tokyo is nearly 1,200 kilometers away from the now-uninhabited island, also known as Battleship Island, which was once a densely populated coal mining site. The document also claimed that Korean laborers \u201csupported\u201d Japan\u2019s industrial growth instead of using the phrase \u201cforced labor\u201d to describe those who were drafted against their will. Although South Korea expressed disagreement over Japan\u2019s initial move to list the facilities in 2015, the Japanese government has insisted they are a symbol of its industrialization. UNESCO granted the world heritage status on the condition of admitting the use of conscripted labor. The Paris-based UN cultural organization also asked the Japanese government to shed light on the \u201cfull history\u201d of the sites. A compromise was reached on July 15 between Seoul and Japan after a Japanese government representative said many Koreans were \u201cforced to work under harsh conditions\u201d at some of the sites during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.But South Korea prodded Japan to carry out its promises during a UNESCO session in July over the lack of action taken to remember the forced labor victims. A report published in 2012 by the Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Colonialism, an affiliate of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, showed that 122 of 600 Korean forced laborers died after being conscripted to Hashima Island.Historians estimate millions of Korean men had been drafted into the Japanese workforce during the Japanese colonial era.

The Seoul Central District Court dismissed the prosecution's writ requests on three executives, whose identities were withheld, saying that it is difficult to acknowledge the need and reasons for their arrests. Prosecutors filed for the warrants on Thursday, charging them with violation of the law regarding safety and hygiene control over livestock products. They are accused of overlooking a hygiene test for patties that might be susceptible to a type of bacteria that causes a form of acute kidney failure known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and of still supplying them to McDonald's Korea.\u00a0 But the court said there is insufficient evidence to prove the supplier's patties inflicted harm on consumers. It accepted the defense argument that the supplier provided reasonable grounds to believe the manufacturing process complied with international standards.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The Seoul prosecutors' office released a statement to media to refute the argument. It said its investigation has found the company sold at least tens of millions of hamburger patties that were either contaminated or suspected of being contaminated with the bacteria. It claimed the supplier also doctored the infection result in which about 1 million of the patties tested positive for the harmful virus, known as 0-157, and delivered them to McDonald's. The prosecution also accused the company of skipping additional tests required to finally determine whether the patties were infected with the bacteria. It said it plans to file for arrest warrants a second time once they supplement the case.Prosecutors have been investigating the local unit of the US fast food chain on suspicions that several consumers, including a 5-year-old girl, became sick after they ate McDonald's burgers served with undercooked patties. The young girl's mother filed a complaint in July seeking a probe into McDonald's, saying that her daughter now suffers from HUS and has to receive dialysis for the rest of her life. Prosecutors raided McDonald's Korea's headquarters and three of its partner firms last month to seize evidence. Joh Ju-yeon, the chief of the Seoul unit, has expressed regret over the issue.

Based on the results of the forensic examination and analysis of the Myeongjin-15\u2019s GPS plotter data and CCTV footage, the Coast Guard plans to find out whether the captain of the tanker is responsible for speeding.A total of 67 vessels, 15 airplanes and 82 divers were mobilized in the search for the missing people at sea, while some 1,380 people including 740 police officers and 130 soldiers were assigned to search the shores.The Coast Guard has requested fishermen on the nearby islands for their cooperation as bodies can be found in the nets in fish farms.The Coast Guard is under fire for being slow in its response. The Coast Guard received the first report about the accident from one of the passengers on the fishing boat at 6:09 a.m., but a rescue vessel left at 6:26 a.m. and arrived at the scene at 6:42 a.m., 33 minutes after the first report.Hwang Jun-hyun, chief of the Incheon Maritime Police station, told the media that the rescue boat didn\u2019t have a nighttime navigation system and had to stop many times on its way because of a thunderstorm. The vessels with nighttime navigation were being repaired, he said.The first divers able to explore the waters around the sunken boat arrived nearly 70 minutes after the first report.Sunday\u2019s tragedy was the worst involving a recreational fishing tour boat since 15 people were killed and three went missing in a similar accident in waters near Jeju Island in September 2015.Accidents involving fishing boats have increased from 77 cases in 2013 and 86 cases in 2014 to 208 in 2016. Most of these fishing boats depart early in the morning and return around 4-5 p.m. They often sail at full speed in order to claim good fishing spots.The Coast Guard said it planned to make fishing vessels undergo a mandatory safety inspection every year, instead of the current 2 1\/2 years.

(Yonhap)\u201cIt is not enough for (North Korea) to stop its program where it is today,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Katina Adams told Voice of America on Monday. \u201cWe do not see any signs that North Korea is willing or interested to engage in credible talks on denuclearization at this stage. North Korea must be prepared to come to the table ready to chart a course to cease and roll back its nuclear weapons program,\u201d she said.Adams\u2019 remarks address a series of recent Russian media reports claiming Pyongyang is ready to resume talks with the US on security issues -- with strings attached. \u201cWe met with Kim Yong-nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly of North Korea,\u201d Vitaly Pashin, a member of the Russian legislature told state-run media Interfax. Pashin was part of a delegation of Russian legislators that were dispatched to the North on Nov. 27, according to media reports. \u201cHe said North Korea is ready to sit down at the negotiating table,\u201d he said, adding that Pyongyang also stressed the US must recognize the reclusive state as a nuclear power to conduct negotiations. In 2003, North Korea officially withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which defines nuclear weapon states and promotes peaceful use of nuclear energy, on US allegations it had launched an illegal enriched uranium weapons program. Pyongyang has often said the goal of its weapons program was to achieve a \u201cbalance of power\u201d with the US. Last month, its state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmin said Pyongyang may consider abandoning its decadeslong nuclear drive if the US gives up its nuclear weapons first. In a separate interview with another Russian media outlet Tass, Pashin said the North also wants Russia to be a key participant at the negotiating table between Pyongyang and Washington. \u201cNorth Korea is currently ready to conduct negotiations with the US with the participation of Russia as a third party,\u201d he said. According to Pashin, the North Korean leadership said its country is regularly exposed to \u201cexternal aggression on the part of the US\u201d and were forced to test-fire its latest missile, which demonstrated \u201cability to strike at any territory of America.\u201d\u201c(North Korea\u2019s missile test on Nov. 29) is the first missile launch since the last one carried out by North Korea on Sept. 15. Since then, Pyongyang had refrained from military provocations for 75 days awaiting reciprocal steps from the US, which, instead of meeting (North Korea) halfway, announced large-scale surprise military drills,\u201d he added. Pashin\u2019s comments are in line with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2019s criticism of the US military drills deliberately pushing North Korea to launch provocations and continue pursuing its nuclear weapons program. South Korea and the US kicked-off a five-day joint air force drill Monday involving more than 230 aircraft and around 12,000 personnel, mere days after the North\u2019s latest missile test. North Korea views the regular exercises as a dress rehearsal for invasion, although the allies insist they are defensive in nature. On Wednesday, Pyongyang launched what experts saw as a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, which reached an altitude of about 4,475 kilometers and flew 950 kilometers for 53 minutes. It is thought to be capable of striking the US mainland if launched at a standard trajectory. During North Korea\u2019s 75-day lull in military provocations, the US hinted at its willingness to establish a solid dialogue channel with the North, with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson claiming it holds multiple communication lines with the communist country. Meanwhile, a Unification Ministry official here highlighted the need for an upgrade in the South Korean government\u2019s approach toward striking negotiations with North Korea. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear capability has become more advanced since the Sept. 19 joint statement was signed in 2005, meaning the opportunity cost of its denuclearization has also increased,\u201d Kim Nam-joong, head of the ministry\u2019s Unification Policy Office, said in a report distributed ahead of a seminar in Seoul on Monday. In 2005, North Korea vowed to give up its nuclear program in exchange for energy assistance and economic cooperation from several nations. Kim pointed out that the North\u2019s concerns have shifted to the security and stability of the current regime with its third-generation power succession amid the downfall of Middle Eastern countries that relinquished their nuclear programs. According to Kim, the current approach focuses on offering economic aid, but it could be more in sync with the North\u2019s current concerns. \u201cSouth Korea and the US must cooperate in drawing a fresh angle for negotiations with North Korea,\u201d he said.

YonhapThe 7th Air Force highlighted the drill was \u201cnot in response to any incident or provocation,\u201d but the exercise is largely seen as US extended deterrence against North Korea, which fired a new Hwasong-15 Intercontinental ballistic missile last Wednesday. Including two dozen stealth aircrafts, the US also dispatched six EA-18G Growler -- electronic warfare aircrafts -- and B-1B Lacer bombers. A group of F-15C and F-16 jet fighters also joined the drill. Most of them flew from US Air Force bases in Japan.For the South Korean part, F-15K, KF-16, FA-50 and F-5 jet fighters will participate in the drill. E-737 Peace Eye surveillance aircrafts and KA-1 training fighters will also join the US advanced assets to conduct \u201crealistic\u201d combat training, according to the South Korean Air Force. \u201cIt is quite rare for the US to deploy stealth fighters in such a scale,\u201d said a South Korean military official, who declined to reveal his identity due to the sensitivity of the issue. During the five-day exercise, the stealth fighters are expected to involve drills targeting North Korea\u2019s mobile missile launchers -- also known as Transporter Erector Launchers -- and underground nuclear and missile facilities.South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry told lawmakers Friday that the exercise will apply combined Prepositioned Air Tasking Order (Pre ATO), a classified military plan that lists air sorties for a fixed 24-hour period, with individual aircraft types, and mission types.The wargame will also focus on conducting precision strikes against North Korea\u2019s long-range artillery units positioned across the border and interdicting operation designed to block North Korea\u2019s Special Forces\u2019 naval infiltration, the military sources said. \u201cThrough real-time coordination and control between the combined forces\u2019 assets, we will ensure our capability to accomplish missions, familiarize with procedures for combined operations and enhance our logistic capability,\u201d the South Korean Air Force said in a statement.Including the units under the US Pacific Command, two US fighter wings stationed in South Korea -- 8th Fighter Wing and 51 Fighter Wing -- joined the exercise. For South Korea, a total of 10 Air Force units participated in the drill, including 11th, 19th and 20th Fighter Wings. Meanwhile, one F-22 fighter was caught showing signs of malfunction when it landed on an airbase in southern city of Gwangju after conducting an air combat drill earlier in the day, according to Yonhap News Agency. The aircraft appeared to stand still on the airstrip for a while after carrying out a 90-minute drill with another three F-22 fighters. Afterwards, the aircraft was drawn by a vehicle to a hanger, while the other three F-22 moved to the place by themselves. \u201cAs Far as we know, all F-22 landed (at the airbase) successfully after completing their mission,\u201d said an official from the South Korean Air Force. \u201cFurther confirmation is needed to figure out why the F-22 failed to move by itself.\u201d(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","419":"Top ranking officials from the ruling and two major opposition parties held talks Monday in last-minute efforts to narrow their apparently wide gap over government spending next year.The meeting between the floor leaders of the three political parties came after the opposition-led parliament missed the legal deadline to pass the government budget bill, which fell on Saturday.National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun has extended the budget session to Monday for now. Whether a plenary session will be held to vote on the spending bill largely depended on the outcome of the meeting between the floor leaders. They are Woo Won-shik of the ruling Democratic Party, Chung Woo-taik of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party and Kim Dong-cheol of the liberal People's Party.The parties largely remained apart over a government plan to greatly increase the number of public employees by up to 12,000 in 2018 alone. The move comes as part of the new Moon Jae-in administration's bold plan to hike the number by 810,000 over the next four years before its single five-year term ends in May 2022.The main opposition party strongly insists the number must be limited to an annual average of around 7,000 while the ruling party refuses to budge from its own lower limit of 10,500.The People's Party says around 8,000 to 9,000 in new government employees should be sufficient. The minor opposition Bareun Party too has stated its opposition to increasing the number public workers by any greater number than a few thousand a year, saying a sudden rise in the number will continue to send ripples throughout the local economy for years to come.The Bareun Party was not represented in the three-way meeting as only those with more than 20 parliamentary seats are recognized as floor negotiation bodies. The splinter conservative party currently controls 11 seats, with the progressive Justice Party holding six parliamentary seats. The ruling party has 121 seats while the main opposition party controls 116.Another point of contention was a proposed hike in corporate tax rates.The government and the ruling party are seeking to increase the corporate tax rate for businesses with taxable profit of more than 200 billion won ($183.8 million) to 25 percent from the current 22 percent.The main opposition party has tabled a counterproposal that would increase the rate to only 23 percent, while lowering the rate for companies with less than 200 million won in taxable income to 8 percent from the current 10 percent.

A parliamentary committee passed the animal bill revision Friday, although it needs final approval at a plenary session later this month. Legislative attempts to strengthen punishment for negligent dog owners have gained steam in recent months after a fatal dog bite involving a K-pop star and a famous business woman sparked calls for better control of potentially dangerous dogs. The bill requires owners of aggressive dog breeds to use a leash and a muzzle in public spaces and bans such animals from entering daycare centers and elementary schools. If dogs that are not leashed carry out fatal attacks, their owners will be subject to up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of 30 million won ($27,650). The bill also allows mayors and provincial governors to keep vicious dogs in isolation without owners' consent if they cause injuries to people.

(Yonhap)\u201c(We) are assessing that the Hwasong-15 is a new type,\u201d Army Col. Roh Jae-cheon, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a press briefing. The announcement follows North Korea\u2019s release of photos that showcased updated features of its new intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday.\u201cThere are clear differences in the appearance of the Hwasong-15\u2019s warhead, the connection part between the first and second stage (of the missile), and the overall size.\u201dThe photos depicting Wednesday\u2019s liftoff of the Hwasong-15, which the North said was an upgraded model of the two-stage ICBM Hwasong-14, portrayed a much rounder warhead shape compared to its previous version. The photos were published by its state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun. Experts here said that the new warhead design is linked to North Korea\u2019s efforts to build a missile that can carry multiple warheads.Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that the North Korean missile broke into three pieces before falling into the East Sea, which sparked concerns that the North had succeeded in building a multiple re-entry vehicle. The vehicle enhances the warheads\u2019 first-strike proficiency with its capability to hit different targets with multiple missiles. \u201cIt seems the rounder warhead shape and the part that protects the re-entry vehicle was designed in consideration to carry multiple warheads in the future,\u201d Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at Korea Aerospace University, told The Korea Herald. Chang also suspected a technological upgrade in the engine system. \u201cFor the first-stage rocket, the North seems to have clustered two Paektusan rocket engines to increase its overall flight durability and range,\u201d said Jang, highlighting how Hwasong-14 was equipped with only one Paektusan engine. \u201cNorth Korea seems to have changed the engine system for the second-stage rocket,\u201d he added.\u201cAlthough it is difficult to determine whether the engine is solid-fueled at the moment, there\u2019s a possibility that it carries a bigger fuel tank and more vernier thrusters.\u201d Thrusters refer to the device used to control and stabilize the missile, according to Chang. Another expert also said there were the first-stage rocket was equipped with two engines, a sign that it was a new type of missile. \u201cThere are two engines in the first stage rocket -- it\u2019s a new type,\u201d Kim Dong-yup, a professor at Kyungnam University\u2019s Far East Institute said in a Facebook post. \u201c(Considering the engines), its altitude and 53-minute flight time, it is capable of striking the entire US mainland.\u201dThere were also clues hinting at the change in the length of the missile, as it was carried on a transporter elector launcher with a total of 18 wheels, whereas the Hwasong-14 was transported on a 16-wheel vehicle. Rodong Sinmun mentioned its new TEL with nine wheels on each side in an article released Wednesday. On Wednesday, the Hwasong-15 reached an altitude of around 4,500 kilometers and flew 960 kilometers before landing in the East Sea, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It puts the US mainland within its target range and is capable of carrying a heavy nuclear warhead, the North\u2019s mouthpiece Korea Central News Agency said.Experts in both South Korea and the US said it would have a range of more than 10,000 to 13,000 kilometers if launched at a range-maximizing trajectory, which could easily reach Washington.But many believe North Korea has yet to secure the missile\u2019s atmospheric re-entry technology, a core element in completing its ICBM program. As an ICBM re-enters the atmosphere and falls at a top speed of Mach 24, it must endure temperatures of 6,000-7,000 degrees Celsius.North Korea claimed that it had completed its \u201cnuclear force\u201d while underlining that its new ICBM is capable of hitting all areas of the United States and delivering a \u201csuper-sized heavy\u201d nuclear warhead, in a separate Rodong Sinmun article.

Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon (Yonhap)\"What's most important is to host the PyeongChang Olympics in a stable atmosphere,\" he said.The allies have not announced the start date for the major exercises, named Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, but they usually kick off the war games in late February or early March.The North has long described the drills as a rehearsal for invasion and used them as an excuse for provocations.Defense sources said earlier that South Korea may request that the US postpone the training to avoid an overlap with Olympic events.The minister was doubtful about the secretive communist nation's claim that it has completed the nuclear weapons development.Emboldened by the successful launch of what it claims to be a new intercontinental ballistic missile Wednesday, the North announced that it has completed the establishment of the country's \"nuclear force.\"Cho said the government's view is that it might be a \"hasty\" declaration.\"Until recently, there were indications that North Korea has faced limits in connection with atmospheric re-entry technology, guiding and sending (an ICBM) to an intended point, and blowing up (the warhead) at a timing it wants,\" he added.\u00a0(Yonhap)","432":"NEW YORK -- US President Donald Trump demanded Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping cut off the country's oil supply to North Korea in response to Pyongyang's latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the US ambassador to the United Nations said.\"President Trump called Chinese President Xi this morning and told him we have come to the point that China must cut off its oil from North Korea,\" Amb. Nikki Haley said during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. \"That will be a pivotal step in the world efforts to stop this international pariah.\"After China briefly severed its oil supply in 2003, North Korea came to the negotiating table, she said.\u00a0 \"Many countries made some big economic and political sacrifices by cutting its ties with North Korea. They did that to serve the peace and security (of the world). ... We now turn to President Xi to also take that stance,\" she said. US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. (AP-Yonhap)\"Through sanctions, we have cut off 90 percent of North Korean trade and 30 percent of its oil, but the crude oil remains. The major supplier of that oil is China.\"The ambassador continued, \"China could do this on its own, or we can take all situation into our own hands,\" alluding to further US action against North Korea in the absence of a Chinese response.The UN envoy also called \"on all nations to cut off all ties with North Korea\" in the UNSC emergency meeting that opened hours after North Korea's launch of a new missile on Wednesday (Korean time), which it said could reach anywhere in the US\"In addition to implementing all UN sanctions, all countries should sever diplomatic relations with North Korea,\" she said and urged the Security Council to revoke the North's voting rights at the UN The US does not seek war with North Korea, the ambassador stated, but she warned that \"The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings us closer to war, not father from it.\"\"If war comes, make no mistake: The North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed,\" she said.Referring to North Korea's declaration of its completion of \"state nuclear force,\" the ambassador noted that \"the North Korean regime misses something very important.\"\"Being a nuclear power comes with certain standards. It comes with being responsible enough to know that you don't threaten other countries with nuclear weapons. You don't starve your own people in order to fund nuclear weapons. You don't bully or play games with nuclear weapons,\" Haley said. \"(But) the regime has shown time and again that it doesn't wanna talk.\"In the UNSC meeting, meanwhile, the Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear and missile tests and urged the US and South Korea to suspend their joint military exercises in December in return. The Russian ambassador said the actions would inflame an already explosive situation, calling for restraint among concerned countries. The Security Council is highly likely to adopt a press or presidential statement in condemnation of the latest North Korean missile test as it has done in past cases.

The missile reportedly flew 950 kilometers at an apogee of 4,475 km to splash into the East Sea.The North announced that it has completed its \"nuclear force\" and claimed the ICBM is capable of hitting all areas of the United States and delivering a \"super-sized heavy\" nuclear warhead. (Yonhap)The newspaper used four front pages to hype up the communist nation's first ballistic missile firing in 2 1\/2 months.The official Korean Central News Agency also made public the same photos.Experts said the round warhead tip may reflect the North's pursuit of a multiple reentry vehicle.\"North Korea seems to have designed the protection cover of the reentry vehicle in consideration of a possible multiple warhead system,\" said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at Korea Aerospace University in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.He added it appears to have replaced the engine system for the second-stage rocket.\"There's a possibility that it has a bigger fuel tank and more vernier thrusters,\" Chang said. \"But it remains unconfirmed whether it's a solid-fuel engine.\"Shin Jong Woo, a senior analyst at the Korea Defense Security Forum based in Seoul, said the North seems to have used a cluster engine for the first stage of the Hwasong-15 as well.\"The Hwasong-14 type was equipped with one Paektusan rocket engine but the Hwasong-15 appears to have two,\" he said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)Pyongyang fired two Hwasong-14 ICBMs in July.It remains uncertain whether the isolated communist nation has developed a brand-new ICBM in just a few months.

In the wake of the North's first two ICBM tests in July and its sixth nuclear test in September, Trump threatened to unleash \"fire and fury\" and \"totally destroy\" the regime if necessary.Pyongyang has responded with various threats, including detonating a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.The UN Security Council adopted two sets of sanctions in response to the North's weapons tests in July and September.Friday's resolution requires UN member states to repatriate North Korean overseas workers within 24 months. Their income is believed to be extorted by Pyongyang to fund the nuclear and ballistic missile programs.It also bans imports of North Korean food, agricultural products, minerals, machinery and electrical equipment to deprive the regime of at least US$200 million in annual export revenues.Both Kim Jong-sik and Ri were blacklisted in the resolution.

It was North Korea\u2019s 20th launch of a ballistic missile this year and likely its third successful test of an ICBM following two launches in July. The launch adds to fears that the North will soon have a military arsenal that can viably target the US mainland.\u00a0\u00a0A look at some of the significant nuclear and missile tests by North Korea this year:(EPA-Yonhap)__\u00a0FEB. 12North Korea conducts its first known test of a new midrange ballistic missile it calls the Pukguksong (Polaris)-2, a land-based variant of an earlier developed submarine-launched missile. The missile uses solid fuel, which makes it easier to move and launch on short notice compared to weapons using liquid fuel. ___MAY 14\u00a0North Korea premiers a newly developed intermediate range missile, Hwasong-12, which it says is designed to carry a heavy nuclear warhead. The flight test is conducted at a highly lofted angle to reduce range and avoid other countries. The North says the missile traveled 787 kilometers and reached a maximum altitude of 2,111 kilometers.___MAY 21North Korea conducts another test launch of the Pukguksong-2 and later declares the missile ready for mass production and operational deployment. The missile flew about 500 kilometers and reached a height of 560 kilometers before crashing into the sea. ___JULY 4North Korea conducts its first flight test of an ICBM, the Hwasong-14, launching it in a highly lofted trajectory. North Korea says the supposedly nuclear-capable missile reached a height of 2,802 kilometers and flew 933 kilometers for 39 minutes before falling into the sea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expresses delight at the successful test, saying that the United States would be displeased by the North\u2018s \u201cpackage of gifts\u201d delivered on the US Independence Day.___JULY 28North Korea conducts its second test of the Hwasong-14 ICBM, which it says reached a maximum height of 3,725 kilometers and traveled 998 kilometers before accurately landing in waters off Japan. The North says the test was aimed at confirming the maximum range and other technical aspects of a missile capable of delivering a \u201clarge-sized, heavy nuclear warhead.\u2019\u2018 Kim says the nighttime launch displayed the country\u2019s ability to fire at \u201crandom regions and locations at random times\u201d with the \u201centire\u201d US mainland now within range. ___AUG. 29North Korea fires a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile from its capital Pyongyang. It flew over Japan before plunging into the northern Pacific Ocean, a change from North Korea\u2019s pattern of firing missiles at highly lofted angles. South Korea\u2019s military says the missile traveled around 2,700 kilometers (1,677 miles) and reached a maximum height of 550 kilometers (341 miles). The launch came weeks after North Korea threatened to launch a salvo of Hwasong-12s that would surround Guam with \u201cenveloping\u201d missile fire. Kim calls the launch a \u201cmeaningful prelude\u201d to containing Guam and called for his military to conduct more tests targeting the Pacific Ocean. ___SEPT. 3North Korea carries out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date, claiming it was a hydrogen bomb designed for use on ICBMs. It says the test was a \u201cperfect success\u201d and a further step in the development of weapons capable of striking anywhere in the United States.___SEPT. 15North Korea fires another Hwasong-12 missile over Japan into the Pacific. The missile flies about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles), marking it the country\u2019s longest missile flight. Kim says his country is nearing its goal of \u201cequilibrium\u201d in military force with the United States. ___NOV. 29South Korea\u2019s military said the latest missile fired from an area near Pyongyang traveled 960 kilometers (596 miles) and reached a height of 4,500 kilometers (2,796 miles).

The Korea Herald explains possible motives behind her boycott and what is likely to happen next.\u00a0One of five public lawyers assigned by the court to former President Park Geun-hye takes questions Monday at Seoul Central District Court in Seoul. Yonhap1. Things to know about Park Geun-hye and her trialPark Geun-hye was South Korea\u2019s conservative icon and first female president until her reign was toppled in March this year by massive public protests over a scandal involving her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil and the country\u2019s largest conglomerate Samsung. Just weeks after her fall from power, Park, 65, was arrested and indicted for a total of 18 charges, including bribery, coercion, abuse of power and the leakage of government secrets. She remains in solitary confinement at a correction facility just south of Seoul. Park\u2019s former rival in the presidential race, Moon Jae-in, now occupies the Blue House, strongly pushing for liberal reforms on the back of his popularity. Earlier this month, Park\u2019s home party, Liberty Korea Party, terminated Park\u2019s party membership, formally severing ties with her. 2. What if Park continues the boycott? Park can still be tried in absentia.\u00a0Former President Park Geun-hye. YonhapAccording to Korean criminal law, hearings can go on without the presence of a defendant in circumstances whereby he or she has failed to perform a court-ordered action. Lead Judge Kim Se-yoon on Monday hinted at a trial in absentia for Park, saying the court would decide Tuesday how to proceed with the trial process if Park continues to not show up. Park\u2019s attorneys, appointed by the court after her initial defense team resigned, would still represent her in the courtroom.\u201c(Refusal to attend trial hearings) will do more harm than good to the defendant because she is denying herself the right to protect her own legal interests,\u201d said Nam Kyoung-kook, a constitutional scholar at the University of Seoul Law School. 3. Who is defending Park now? Park\u2019s seven-lawyer defense team resigned en masse on Oct. 16, after the court rejected their request for Park to be tried without detention once the detention warrant expired. They called the judges and their decision \u201cbiased\u201d and the trial \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Park then refused to appoint new attorneys and said she would boycott the trial altogether. On Oct. 26, the court assigned five public lawyers to the former president, but she has refused to meet with them. The five attorneys have six to 31 years of experience in legal practice each, according to the court. Outside the courtroom and outside South Korea, Park is receiving backing from international legal team MH Group, which last month made claims that she has been mistreated in jail and made clear its plan to bring her case to an international court. 4. Does a boycott mean Park has given up fighting? Many in legal and political circles believe Park\u2019s boycott of the trial is a calculated move to later reject any ruling unfavorable to her. The role of MH Group, which previously represented Saif Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan leader who was freed from jail after six years in a move at amnesty, is to mount international pressure on Korean authorities to make a similar exit for her. Domestically, with local elections scheduled for June, some political watchers say Park may be attempting to cast herself as a martyr and victim of the liberals\u2019 political revenge against conservatives and solidify conservative support behind her.\u00a05. What is the outlook on Park\u2018s trial?The courts have found other suspects in Park\u2019s scandal guilty, and have passed down prison terms to the majority of the defendants.While they continue to appeal, Park\u2019s former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon, as well as a number of former senior presidential aides have been found guilty on one or more charges that range from abuse of power and bribery to blacklisting of those critical of the administration. Choi Soon-sil, the alleged architect of the far reaching network of corruption, has been found guilty of illegally gaining a university place for her daughter, and awaits ruling on bribery charges. On the charge regarding university entrance, Choi has been sentenced to three years in prison and the first bribery trial is set to come to an end next month.

They include 650,000 public rental houses and 200,000 private rental homes.The ruling bloc also agreed to provide 300,000 low-priced, small rental houses, including 50,000 dormitory rooms, to young adults aged 39 or younger, and increase loan programs for these citizens.The two sides also agreed to expand the definition of newlyweds to include those married for up to seven years without children and soon-to-be-married couples so as to entitle them to state programs that currently apply only to those married for up to five years.For those newlyweds, the government plans to provide homes at 70 percent to 80 percent of market prices.For senior citizens, the ruling bloc seeks to introduce a new program under which they can sell their houses and receive pensions in regular installments, while living in public rental houses.The government plans to announce detailed plans for housing support Wednesday, officials said.

Ahn, who ran against President Moon Jae-in in the presidential election in May, also criticizes the Moon administration of \u201cinaction\u201d with regards to North Korea\u2019s recent violation of the armistice agreement of the Korean War.Ahn Cheol-soo, the chairman of the minor opposition People\u2019s Party, speaks during an interview with The Korea Heraldon Thursday. (Park Hyun-koo \/ The Korea Herald)In an interview with The Korea Herald on Thursday, the party leader said the government should lodge an official complaint to North Korea over the incident. \u201cThe government should make an objection to the North and bring out some kind of a statement from the rogue state,\u201d he said. The violations of the armistice conditions occurred last week during a North Korean soldier\u2019s daring escape to South Korea. In the incident, North Korean soldiers were seen firing weapons across the Military Demarcation Line in the Joint Security Area in their pursuit of the defecting soldier. The MDL acts as the border between the two Koreas.On the South Korean military\u2019s handling of the situation -- not shooting back at the North -- he also said it should \u201cadhere to principles\u201d and \u201cconfront North Korea strongly.\u201dCiting the global trend of nations imposing stronger sanctions to pressure the North, he said it was time for the South Korean government to take a hard-line stance and to add to the international efforts to pressure. The United States recently relisted the rogue regime as a state sponsor of terrorism.The party chief also stressed the importance of strengthening the alliance with the US, saying that is the way to make the North Korea talk to the South.\u201cNorth Korea is talking directly to the US and appears to be leaving us out of the discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should maintain a strong relationship with the US to make sure the North do not get what it wants from our ally. And we should make sure that North Korea knows that,\u201d he explained. Building a good relationship with China should also be worked on, but the government should not walk on eggshells only to please the country. \u201cIt is not too much to ask for an apology from China for its economic retaliation against the deployment of THAAD here, is it?\u201d he said.\u00a0Ahn Cheol-soo, the chairman of the minor opposition People\u2019s Party (Park Hyun-koo \/ The Korea Herald)While calling for stronger stance toward the North for now, Ahn, as a supporter of the \u201cSunshine Policy,\u201d said the ability to balance between tough and moderate measures was key to solving nuclear issues and relationship with North Korea.The Sunshine Policy was the strategy of engagement and pursuing friendlier inter-Korean relations employed by late Presidents Kim Dae-jung. Late President Roh Moo-hyun, who took office immediately after Kim, for the large part maintained the policy, seeking to engage Pyongyang. \u201cImposing stricter and stricter sanctions to demolish the regime is not the way either. No government has collapsed because they could not endure sanctions,\u201d he said.He had suggested the government to send anthelmintic to the North as part of a humanitarian aid, during a party meeting on Wednesday, as he believes humanitarian aids should be kept independent of political and diplomatic situations.Ahn said the South should make efforts to gain trust from the North Korean people to prepare for a future when the two Koreas unite, and pointed to how they have greater trust for China.During the interview, Ahn did not leave out his concerns for his party and reiterated that the People\u2019s Party had been upfront about leading the multiparty scene at the National Assembly. \u201cThe creation of the People\u2019s Party is a miracle in itself, as the political sphere in South Korea had always been dominated by the ruling and the main opposition party,\u201d he said. The People\u2019s Party was only established in February last year, two months before the general election. It won in 40 constituencies, most of them concentrated in the Honam region -- the Jeolla provides of the country\u2019s southwest, which has long been the stronghold of the liberal bloc. Saying that more citizens are supportive of the multiparty system, he credited his party of creating the diverse political landscape here.\u201cIn a poll, I saw more than 60 percent of the people support the multiparty system. People are acknowledging the good in having a third party that keeps the two main political factions in check,\u201d he said. Comparing local politics to the duopoly that existed in flights to Jeju Island, before the introduction of budget carriers, Ahn said that the existence of more than two negotiation groups in the parliament promotes competition.\u201cWhen people see the two major parties, a governing one and its opposition, they think the two would fiercely compete with each other. But it turns out that they were not, and they were actually benefiting from each other\u2019s existence,\u201d he said.The 55-year-old politician, who began his career as a medical doctor and founded the country\u2019s largest antivirus software company, said that his life has been all about changes. \u201cWhat I spent the longest time doing is sales. People do not know this. I did not run the company (AhnLab) as a programmer,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cI have continuously worked to be effectively fit into the role I am in (at any given time), this has been true in being a doctor, CEO, professor, and politician.\u201d When asked whether he faces limits in pursuing changes in South Korean politics, he said the country\u2019s electoral system is one of the biggest hindrances. \u201cThe current single-member electorate system is the factor that is fostering the bipartisan system. We should change the election system to allow more political parties to have voices,\u201d he said. Ahn said he supported a system of larger constituencies with more than one representative, but that he was willing to accept and discuss different systems, such as party-list proportional representation, with other parties. The party leader is currently pushing to establish a political alliance with the conservative opposition Bareun Party, as he sees it is important for the third faction to be strong against the two major parties. While not all of the 40 members of his party agree with a merger, they unanimously consented on building a policy alliance with the Bareun Party. For the multiparty system to be sustained, it is crucial that the two parties gather efforts to ensure competitiveness in the upcoming local elections in June. \u201cNow we talk about working together on policies, and I see that we should also further the discussion on building an alliance in the election,\u201d he said.It is right for them to become strong as a third faction and compete in a three-way race in the local elections, rather than the current four, he added.In the latest poll by Realmeter on Thursday, the People\u2019s Party stood last in the list of five main political parties with an approval rating of 4.4 percent among 1,515 respondents. The minor conservative Bareun Party, which has 11 parliamentary seats, stood at 5.6 percent, and the left-leaning Justice Party posted at 6.9 percent. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea garnered 51.8 percent to top the list and the main opposition Liberty Korea Party followed with 16.7 percent.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)","448":"The rain has stopped in most regions nationwide, but the foggy weather arrived Sunday morning.Low visibility could make driving difficult Sunday morning, especially in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

The matter of his term, if approved for the post, was also raised by lawmakers, to which Lee said he hoped he would be the last Constitutional Court chief nominee to be affected by the issue. The Constitutional Court chief\u2019s term is a contested issue due to ambiguity in related laws, which state the chief of the court has a term of six years. However, the laws do not clarify whether a new chief serves six years from the point of taking the higher office or if the term ends when the new chief\u2019s term as a Constitutional Court justice ends.

Dongyuan's owner, Sun Sidong, was also blacklisted.Mnuchin said the US is sanctioning shipping and transportation companies, as well as their vessels, for \"(facilitating) North Korea's trade and its deceptive maneuvers.\"The statement pointed out that North Korea is banned under a UN Security Council resolution from using \"deceptive\" shipping practices, such as ship-to-ship transfers.One North Korean company was designated for its alleged role in exporting North Korean labor to generate income for the regime.Two government entities -- the Maritime Administration Bureau and the Ministry of Land and Marine Transport -- were also included on the list.Trump said a day earlier that North Korea will be under \"the highest level\" of sanctions once they are all announced over a two-week period.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also told reporters the increasing sanctions are starting to have an effect on the impoverished nation, with long lines forming at gas stations.The UN Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions in the wake of North Korea's long-range missile tests in July and sixth nuclear test in September, to include caps on its imports of petroleum and related products.While critics express skepticism that any amount of sanctions will force Pyongyang to denuclearize, many officials and experts agree that such economic pressure is the only solution to the standoff short of war.\"As of about a month and a half ago ... it was at least 20 countries around the world that had done different things with that maximum pressure campaign,\" Heather Nauert, the State Department's spokeswoman, said at a press briefing Tuesday.\"That would exclude countries being involved in UN Security Council resolutions and various sanctions,\" she noted, \"but just countries that we've had conversations with alone, where we have said, 'Reduce the number of North Korean guest workers in your country, reduce the footprint of their embassy, kick out North Korean guest workers.'\"South Korea's foreign ministry said that it saw the latest US move as a \"reaffirmation\" of Washington's commitment to working together with the international community to induce the denuclearization of North Korea by using strong sanctions and pressure.The ministry also said that South Korea and the US will maintain close cooperation and coordination at every possible level to achieve their joint objective of \"peacefully\" resolving the North's nuclear problem.

Park pushed for a revision of history textbooks that she claimed were \"left-leaning.\" But her version sparked backlash from opponents who said they distort modern history in a way that glorifies the dictatorial rule of ex-leader and her father Park Chung-hee. President Moon Jae-in scrapped the plan in the first month of his presidency that started in May, following Park's ouster over a corruption scandal. The probe team found that the ministry was allotted a budget of 4.38 billion won ($3.98 million) for the textbooks from the finance ministry in 2015, which only took a day to be decided.\u00a0\u00a0(Yonhap)More than half of the amount was earmarked for promotion and marketing, which is odd considering that the budget was originally intended for research and development, the probe team said.\u00a0 It discovered that several officials from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae instructed the ministry as to how to execute the budget for advertising. Evidence shows that the officials picked which advertising company and broadcasting channel the ministry should contact to make the promotion footage and air it, it said. The current law stipulates that any state-led promotion campaign must be done through a competitive bidding. The probe team also raised suspicions over misappropriation, as the marketing costs are seen to have been excessively charged. The probe team said it has requested the prosecution to investigate seven officials from Cheong Wa Dae and the then ruling Saenuri Party on possible charges of a violation of state contract law, breach of duty and abuse of power.Last month, the probe team revealed that the ministry under Park's leadership took a mission to doctor citizens' written statements to be in favor of the uniform history textbooks.

Proceeds from the sale goes into a fund to care for the 37 surviving victims and to establish a sex slavery museum.\u201cThe fact that the product doesn\u2019t explicitly say \u2018I support military sex slaves\u2019 makes it more stylish and fashionable,\u201d said college student Kim Ha-yeon, who recently joined the list of people who support victims by using Marymond\u2019s products.\u00a0Marymond saw a tenfold jump in sales to 4 billion won in 2016. Its customers include A-list celebrities such as Suzy and Park Bo-gum. Following the recent growth, over 585 million won was delivered to the victims\u2019 shelter last year.\u00a0The company\u2019s success is not just driven by public interest in the unsolved issue, a long-standing thorn in Korea-Japan relations, but also reflects the rise of \u201cconscious\u201d consumption, experts say.\u00a0\u201cBuying a product from the company that cares about the community makes people feel good and proud to sport the brand. In that sense, it is the charity factor that has caused Marymond to become such a successful one,\u201d said professor Chung Dong-il of Economics from Sookmyung Women\u2019s University.\u00a0\u201cAlso, there is an emotional impact that is attached to buying a product,\u201d he said.Like Marymond, Craftlink sells colorful handmade string bracelets to support over 24,000 single mothers in South Korea who live in the shadows of society.\u00a0Craftlink\u201cBy buying a trendy accessory, consumers can help others. It makes people feel better about their purchase because they are supporting a good cause with their money,\u201d Martin Ko, CEO of Craftlink, told The Korea Herald.\u00a0The company in 2013 sold bracelets made by single mothers worth 30 million won in 20 days through web portal Naver. Early this year, it launched a complete collection of accessory items to support single moms.\u00a0\u201cOne person, on their own, cannot fundamentally solve or tackle the root of the social problems like the state\u2019s poor support for single mothers, but purchasing a product that is directly connected to their living can have an impact,\u201d Ko said.\u00a0Experts said social network services drove the popularity of such items, as interested individuals share information about the social value-added items with their like-minded followers.\u00a0\u201cYoung generations are creating their own ways of studying historic issues and supporting social movements,\u201d Professor Seo Kyeong-deok of Sungshin Women\u2019s University said in a recent interview.\u00a0But there were also concerns over the commercialization of sensitive social and historic issues.\u00a0\u201cSales of social value-incorporated products can support those in need and help raise awareness of social issues, but when an issue related to nationalism is combined with commercialism, there is a possibility that product marketing which only sheds light to sensitive and certain historical facts may lead to exclusions and antagonism,\u201d said professor Lee Taek-gwang of Global Communication from Kyung Hee University.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","477":"President Moon Jae-in's approval rating declined last week amid a drawn-out political standoff over his disputed personnel choices and a fake tip-off scandal, a survey indicated Monday.In the weekly survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter from Monday through Friday, 74.6 percent approved of Moon's job performance, down 2 percentage points from a week earlier.Those, who disapproved of his performance, made up 18.6 percent, up 2.6 percentage points from the previous week, while 6.8 percent said they were unsure or refused to answer. This photo, taken on July 13, 2017, shows President Moon Jae-in speaking during a meeting with his senior secretaries at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul.

Experts say it is a matter of time before the reclusive state develops ICBMs mounted with a nuclear warhead.Ryan said he spent a few days last week working on just the North Korea issue.That was when tensions ran high as US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leadership traded bellicose rhetoric. Trump threatened to rain \"fire and fury\" on Pyongyang if it continued to threaten the US or its allies. In response, the North announced plans to fire missiles towards Guam.The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, later backed down, saying he would watch Washington's behavior a little longer.\"This young man is an unstable person,\" Ryan said of Kim. \"I do think he should be called to account for his reckless rhetoric and I think that's what the president's trying to do.\"The president, in my own view, he likes the unpredictability side of this,\" he added.Ryan also pointed his finger at China, saying North Korea's main ally and trading partner needs to do \"a lot more\" to rein in the regime.

But the June photo showed none of the vehicles remained except for a truck parked there. This file photo, taken Aug. 11, 2017, from the Dora Observatory in Paju, north of Seoul, shows the now-shuttered South Korean industrial park (front) in the North Korean city of Kaesong. (Yonhap)The missing vehicles, which were used by many South Korean companies, were reportedly gathered at the apparels company's spacious parking lot after the complex's shutdown.VOA said it looked at other companies' premises but failed to locate any of the vehicles.There is speculation that the North's authorities may have moved the vehicles out of the complex to liquidate the South's assets there.Shortly after Seoul decided to shut down the complex, the North deported South Korean workers from the complex and one month later said it would liquidate all of the assets held by the South.Opened in 2004, the factory zone had housed 124 South Korean firms hiring more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.South Korea's unification ministry said it has no information to verify whether the VOA report is true but made clear that North Korea's possible use of those vehicles is an illegal act that violates local firms' property rights.\"Cars and other property at the Kaesong complex belong to South Korean firms.

(Yonhap)The government under President Moon Jae-in's predecessor said that since the establishment of the complex in 2004, around $560 million in total has been provided to North Korean workers at the factory zone, including $120 million in 2015 alone.How income is provided to North Korean workers at the complex has been under the spotlight due to the possibility that it may violate UN sanctions resolutions on North Korea.Previously, South Korean firms sent wages for the North Korean workers in dollars to the North's committee running the complex via a branch of a local bank in Kaesong. The committee then distributed coupons or North Korean bills equivalent to about 30-40 percent of the total wages to the workers after sending the hard currency to the North Korean regime.South Korea's unification ministry earlier said the resumption of the industrial park would hinge on progress in the resolution of North Korea's nuclear and missile problems.A resumption of the complex could spur a dispute over South Korea's possible violation of international sanctions.The senior government official also struck such a view, though he said there is no specific evidence about the wage's possible conversion.\"(For the resumption of the factory zone), there needs to be (the resolution) of North Korea's nuclear issue and a turnaround in strained inter-Korean ties,\" he said. \"We need to comprehensively take into account such factors (for the re-opening).\"Touching on the so-called Moon's Berlin proposal, the official said that South Korea will make persistent efforts to improve inter-Korean ties.Moon unveiled a broad vision for bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula during his speech in Berlin last Thursday, two days after the North test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile.He proposed that the two Koreas mutually suspend acts of hostility along their tense border on the July 27 anniversary of the armistice treaty that ended conflict in the 1950-53 Korean War.Moon also offered to hold reunions of families torn apart by the war on Oct. 4, Korea's lunar fall harvest holiday and the 10th anniversary of the second inter-Korean summit.The Chosun Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper based in Japan, said Tuesday that Moon should not expect a positive response from Pyongyang to his proposal if he continues to seek its submission to the United States.

At a closed-door parliamentary briefing, the National Intelligence Service assessed the launch on July 4 as an \u201cinitial-level\u201d flight test using a fixed launcher, instead of a road-mobile system set for actual deployment, lawmakers said. Although the North is progressing faster than expected, it is likely to still be working on the re-entry technology, the agency said. The assessment runs contrary to Pyongyang\u2019s assertion that it had verified the reliability of late-stage guidance and heat resistance for a nuclear warhead under the maximum hostile re-entry conditions.\u201cIt has not been confirmed whether it succeeded in re-entry, and given that it does not have a related testing facility, it appears to have not yet secured the technology,\u201d Rep.

(Yonhap)At home, the NIS said it will carry out a sweeping reform focusing on eliminating domestic functions and investigating past allegations such as on its suspected interference in a 2012 presidential election, during which President Moon Jae-in was defeated. To that aim, Director Suh Hoon unveiled its plan to abolish the information officer system under which it dispatches agents to state agencies and media organizations to collect information. The NIS is also seeking to refurbish the three-pronged organization by shifting the main duties of the second deputy director, who is currently responsible for domestic intelligence and anticommunist investigations, to take charge of North Korea affairs.

The North Koreans won't be able to achieve this performance tomorrow, but they likely will eventually,\" Schilling said.\"A range of as much as 9,700 kilometers, approximately the distance from North Korean launch sites to the US naval base at San Diego, would be possible with a 500 kg payload,\" he said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The expert said that even though the missile has a \"payload shroud,\" the North won't be able to master the technology to put multiple warheads in it for the next 15 years. Instead, the regime is expected to focus on putting a single warhead and multiple decoys and penetration aids in it, he said.\"The US national missile defense system in its current state is limited and unreliable, working only about half the time in tests. But North Korea has to consider that deploying an operational ICBM would motivate the United States to improve its defenses,\" Schilling said. \"They can't possibly hope to build more ICBMs than the US can build missile defense interceptors.

(123rf)According to traditional beliefs, during a leap month, good family events, mainly marriages, are to be avoided, while it is OK to carry out funeral-related works such as changing burial sites. South Korea is in the middle of a 13th month lasting from June 24 to July 22, but the myths and superstitions surrounding it appear to be fading -- at least among the young generation. \u201cI did not really know it was a leap month until I went to the wedding hall company to settle my wedding day last year,\u201d said 28-year-old Cho In-young who got married in the last week of June. \u201cWe decided to go ahead, because none of us and our parents cared.\u201d Another bride, Yoon Ji-young, specifically chose to tie the knot during the leap month, because of a 50 percent discount that a wedding consultancy offered. \u201cAs Christians, our family does not believe in such superstitions,\u201d she said. Wedding industry insiders said leap-month discounts and special promotions are also disappearing, because there are more couples who think like Yoon these days. \u201cYoung couples nowadays do not seem to be aware of the leap month traditions. We saw only a 5 percent decrease in reservations compared to last year, and the rate could have been influenced by the rainy season,\u201d said an official at a wedding hall company in Apgujeong, central Seoul. To the generation used to the solar calendar, the concept of a leap month can be unfamiliar. Kim Seung-woo, a 29-year-old university student revealed that he had heard of the term, but did not know what it was exactly.Leap months occur seven times over a 19-year period in the lunar calendar because a month is counted by a cycle of the moon. A lunar year is usually 11 days shorter than its solar counterpart. To compensate the difference, an extra month is inserted around every three years.There are superstitions that no ghost or spirit exists to influence human affairs during leap months, as they do not recognize the month. This also means that there are no good spirits to watch over newlyweds and families, and no bad spirits to interrupt the way to the afterlife. Such superstitions date back only a few centuries, scholars said, adding that until the late Joseon era, the month was considered a good time to do anything. Kim Myung-ja, an emeritus professor of the Department of Folklore at Andong National University, explained that tradition changed. \u201cAs time passed, people became more cautious in leap months and they started to avoid getting married or giving birth,\u201d she said.\u00a0 The demand for shrouds jumped in the leap month, as the traditional belief says the extra lunar month is a good time to get funeral-related work done. (Yonhap)Many now seem less concerned about whether there are good spirts to watch over them during leap months. However, when it comes to evil spirits, more people seem to care. Burial and cremation-related affairs, in particular the relocation of corpses already buried, have gone up sharply since the leap month began. Online reservations for the 58 public cremation facilities across the nation have been fully booked with over 20,000 cremations of buried corpses. Aware of the rise in demand, the ministry announced that it would extend the reservation period for cremation services from the current 15 days in advance to 30 days. It also said extra cremation furnaces would be put to use if there is a shortage during the month. \u201cMy father\u2019s body will be removed from its current burial place in Cheonan to a woodland burial after cremation next week, so that he can peacefully rest amid nature,\u201d said Kim, who declined to reveal her full name. \u201cIt is simple.

So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday.For China, the worst-case scenario is a collapse of the regime in Pyongyang, which could see an influx of refugees from its impoverished neighbour, and worse yet, US troops stationed on its border in a united Korea.Trump had until recently nurtured friendly ties with Xi, hosting him at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April, when they agreed on a 100-day plan to improve trade relations.Beijing's spokesman Geng defended China's dealings with North Korea, insisting that Beijing has upheld UN sanction resolutions \"in a comprehensive and earnest manner\".But, he added, sanctions \"should not harm the livelihood and normal humanitarian need of the DPRK,\" using the initials of North Korea's official name.Multiple sets of United Nations sanctions have failed to derail the North's weapons programs.","508":"Pyongyang warned it would be a \"piece of cake\" to destroy \"gangster\" South Korea, state media reported Thursday, as it raged against Seoul for a joint missile drill with the US following its landmark intercontinental ballistic missile test. The isolated, nuclear-armed North sent a chill through the international community Tuesday after its missile launch, a milestone in Pyongyang's decades-long drive for the capability to threaten the US mainland with a nuclear strike.US President Donald Trump had dismissed the idea of the North having a working ICBM, vowing it \"won't happen,\" but experts say the missile could reach Alaska or even further towards the continental US. The test prompted the US and the South to stage a joint missile drill aimed at countering the North's threats, after South Korean President Moon Jae-In called for a response beyond \"just words\".North Korea hit back Thursday, with its propaganda National Peace Committee for Korea criticising Moon for denouncing Pyongyang \"instead of getting rejoiced over the praiseworthy event\" staged by its northern neighbour, according to the KCNA news agency. Mocking the South as \"puppet military gangsters,\" the KCNA report added: \"It will be as easy as a piece of cake for the (North) to wipe out the puppet forces ... as we are now able to destroy even the US mainland across the ocean.\" Left-leaning Moon, who has advocated dialogue with the North to bring it to negotiating table, condemned the launch and joined calls for tighter sanctions on Pyongyang. The latest test drew also widespread condemnation and prompted the US to push for new, tougher sanctions against Pyongyang at an UN Security Council meeting held on Wednesday. In a hard-hitting address to the UN Security Council, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said Tuesday's ICBM test had made \"the world a more dangerous place,\" and that Washington was ready to use force if need be to deal with the threat of a nuclear-armed Pyongyang.The North's leader Kim Jong-Un described the ICBM launch -- staged on the US Independence Day holiday -- as a gift to \"American bastard\" and vowed to give more \"gift packages\" to the US in the future.The impoverished North is already under onerous international sanctions imposed over its past nuclear and missile tests held in violation of UN resolutions, which ban it from using any ballistic or nuclear technologies.

The annual South Korea-US drill is beginning as tensions rise to a new high, with Washington raising the pressure on several nations to sever ties with the hermit state. Military tensions are expected to peak during the annual exercise after North Korea openly lambasted the drill as \u201cthe most explicit expression of hostility\u201d against its regime, via the North\u2019s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun on Sunday.\u00a0A U-2 reconnaissance aircraft engages in landing and takeoff training as part of Ulchi Freedom Guardian, a South Korea-US joint exercise, at Osan Air Base in Gyeonggi Province on Monday. (Yonhap)It added the exercise \u201cwill be like pouring gasoline on fire\u201d and is driving the Korean Peninsula into an \u201cuncontrollable phase of nuclear war.\u201dIn response, President Moon Jae-in warned Pyongyang on Monday not to use the joint military exercises as a pretext for provocations, stressing the drills are \u201cdefensive in nature.\u201d \u201cNorth Korea must understand that it is because of its repeated provocations that South Korea and the US have to conduct defensive exercises, which in turn keeps the vicious cycle going,\u201d Moon said during a Cabinet meeting Monday. The South Korean president also vowed to make full efforts to contain the situation, while upholding the government\u2019s two-track approach of dialogue and sanctions against the North. Moon had previously attended a National Security Council meeting at 9 a.m. on Monday with Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon and several senior government officials to discuss plans related to the joint exercise and defense against possible North Korean provocations. But the Pentagon announced that this year\u2019s UFG drill will involve fewer American troops -- about 17,500, down from last year\u2019s 25,000. US Defense Secretary James Mattis explained the reduction is due to the current focus on integration operations and a requirement for fewer people, and that it is not due to tensions with North Korea.In recent years, North Korea has displayed military provocations around the joint exercise period. Pyongyang fired a submarine-based ballistic missile last year and shot antiaircraft guns at an anti-North Korea propaganda loudspeaker unit near the inter-Korean border in 2015.Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea renewed calls for Pyongyang to accept Seoul\u2019s offer to open dialogue. \u201cNorth Korea should accept (the reduced level of US troops) as a signal for a North Korea-US dialogue channel,\u201d Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the Democratic Party, said during a meeting with senior party members Monday. \u201cI also hope the North will not make a reckless decision to engage in another provocative act by misjudging the situation,\u201d she added. While the joint exercises are being carried out here, Washington is expected to stick to its agenda of convincing the global community to use their diplomatic and economic clout in bringing about Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization. The Donald Trump administration called on South American countries such as Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Peru to cut off diplomatic and trade ties with North Korea last week. \u201cThe era of strategic patience is over with regard to North Korea. All options are on the table,\u201d US Vice President Mike Pence said, following his meeting with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet on Thursday. Chile exported $2 million worth of products to North Korea in 2015, of which 90 percent was copper, while importing $25 million, largely in steel and iron products, said Bloomberg, citing Chilean media. The US has been ratcheting up pressure on China to use Pyongyang\u2019s reliance on the world\u2019s second largest economy as means to cut off funds for the North\u2019s nuclear and missile development.The growing worries here also involve the US\u2019 tightening efforts to intervene in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic relations, which may trigger further anger from North Korea. \u201cThere is a high chance of the North conducting military provocation around this time,\u201d Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told The Korea Herald. \u201cIt seems the US is trying to induce a response from the North through contacting the South American nations. ... But it is crucial to be cautious and aware of the consequences of those actions.\u201dBy Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)","510":"Ulsan Nambu Police said Thursday that they plan to install a multilingual voice system at bus stations throughout the city of Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province.

Two South Korean soldiers were killed and five injured in an explosion inside a K-9 Thunder during artillery training Friday in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province. The training was designed to improve the accuracy of counter-artillery attacks in the event of a war with North Korea. Although the exact cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the blast appears to have been caused by the explosive that is used to propel artillery shells toward targets, said the South Korean Army on Monday, citing accounts by those injured. \u201cFor reasons unknown, there was smoke inside the howitzer\u2019s breach block assembly,\u201d an Army official said under the customary condition of anonymity. \u201cAccording to our on-site investigation, three rounds of explosive were completely burned down without any trace.\u201d The Army decided to halt K-9 artillery firing for training purposes until it finds the exact cause of the explosion. In the meantime, the military will soon establish a comprehensive investigative panel consisting of government officials and civilian experts. South Korea self-propelled Howitzer K-9 engages in a live-fire exercise. YonhapDeveloped by local defense manufacturer Samsung Techwin, which was renamed Hanhwa Techwin after being sold off in 2014, the K-9 was touted as a high-quality artillery unit for its long range and high rate of firing. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration signed export deals with Turkey, Poland, Finland and India.But the performance of the K-9 came under scrutiny when two howitzers suffered malfunctions when they were engaged against North Korea\u2019s artillery during Pyongyang\u2019s 2010 bombardment of Yeonpyongdo, an island in the West Sea close to the border with the North. \u201cThe K-9 artillery is a crucial part of our ground combat assets. But we continue to see the weapon system suffer from technical malfunctions and accidents,\u201d said Rep. Lee Hae-hoon, chair of the conservative opposition Bareun Party on Monday. According to a parliamentary inquiry in 2016, there have been more than 1,700 reports of malfunctions with the K-9 artillery over the past five years. Currently, about 500 K-9 are fielded since its prototype was produced in 1999. But some analysts noted that the opposition party should refrain from dismissing the K-9 as a dysfunctional weapon system, saying that it is too early to tell whether the explosion was caused by a technical issue.Following its setback during the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong, the K-9 received a series of modifications to reduce its rate of malfunction. Separately, the military revealed a plan last week to improve the K-9\u2019s performance, including the development of an automated loading system, similar to a robotic turret.Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Security and Defense Forum, said the frequency of malfunctions that the K-9 has suffered is \u201cnot unusual,\u201d noting the number is pretty much the same as that of malfunctions when driving a car. \u201cMore than 1,000 K-9s have been produced and they suffered from 1,700 malfunctions over the past five years. It means that every K-9 suffers from about two cases of malfunction every five years. If you drive your car for five years, you might see a similar number of malfunctions,\u201d Yang said.

Kim Hong-kyun (R), special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs at the South Korean foreign ministry, poses with his US and Japanese counterparts -- Joseph Yun (L) and Kenji Kanasugi -- before discussions on North Korea`s nuclear and missile threats in Tokyo on April 25, 2017. (Kyodo) (Yonhap)Member states of the long-suspended six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the North are expected to send their officials, along with private-sector experts, to the informal Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Singapore.The NEACD is an annual security forum regarded as the \"Track 1.5\" platform where North Korea, along with South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia, usually send senior nuclear envoys.The US State Department earlier said that its special envoy on North Korea, Joseph Yun, will join the conference.\"We are also considering sending our nuclear envoy Kim Hong-kyun to the conference,\" the ministry official said. \"It is very likely that Kim will attend it as the US decided to send Joseph Yun there.\"He added that Kim also mentioned a possible meeting with Yun at the conference in his phone conversation held Wednesday to discuss countermeasures against the North's missile provocation a day earlier. The North claimed it successfully test-fired an ICBM on Tuesday.It is not clear whether the Japanese envoy will join the NEACD, but if he does, there is a possibility that a trilateral meeting of South Korea, the US and Japan could take place. Their last meeting was held in Tokyo in April.North Korea sent Choe Son-hui in charge of North America affairs to the conference last year, but it has not confirmed yet whether it will join this year's gathering. (Yonhap)","513":"The prospects of two Constitutional Court nominees remained uncertain Monday as opposition parties ramped up their offensive over the duo's alleged ideological bias.Major parties agreed to hold a parliamentary confirmation hearing for justice nominee Lee You-jung next Monday and decided tentatively to set up a vote on Constitutional Court President-designate Kim Yi-su four days later. But opposition lawmakers heaped pressure on President Moon Jae-in to withdraw Lee's nomination, which they argued she does not deserve due to her past support for a liberal candidate in a 2011 Seoul mayoral election. Chung Woo-taik (L) and Joo Ho-young, the floor leaders of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party and Bareun Party, respectively, attend a meeting with parliamentary speaker Chung Sye-kyun at the National Assembly in Seoul on Aug. 21, 2017. (Yonhap)Speculation also persists that the issue surrounding Lee could hamper the parliamentary approval process for Kim, who himself has come under fire for what detractors call his \"left-wing streak.\"The floor leaders of the four major parties gathered in the morning to discuss the contentious nominees, but failed to narrow their differences.\"The controversy has been triggered as (the president) sent to parliament a figure that has not been vetted,\" Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, said during the meeting. \"The president should retract the nomination.\"Kim Dong-cheol, the floor leader of the minor People's Party, warned that the court could descend into a \"political institution\" should a politically skewed figure join the nine-member bench.The ruling Democratic Party defended the nominees, highlighting the urgency of filling the court's top post that has been vacant since former President Park Han-chul retired in January. Woo Won-shik, the floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party, attends a regular meeting with parliamentary speaker Chung Sye-kyun at the National Assembly in Seoul on Aug. 21, 2017. (Yonhap)\"The void has not been filled for an unprecedentedly long period of time ... It is not a matter that we can delay any further,\" Woo Won-shik, the party whip, said.At issue is Lee's backing for Park Won-soon, a former progressive civil activist and the incumbent Seoul mayor, during the 2011 election. Though she was then a private attorney with no political affiliation, critics said her endorsement for Park could undermine the court's core principle of political neutrality.The dispute surrounding Kim centers on his 1980 ruling against a pro-democracy activist and his minority opinion against the 2014 disbandment of a far-left political party involving members accused of pro-North Korean activities.Kim's appointment requires consent from a majority of lawmakers present during a floor vote that can be set up by a majority of all 299 legislators. The ruling party holds only 120 seats, making it necessary to secure opposition support.Lee's appointment, meanwhile, does not require parliamentary consent. (Yonhap)","514":"South Korea and the US on Wednesday confirmed North Korea\u2019s claim that it had launched a ballistic missile with an intercontinental range, but doubts persisted over whether the communist state had overcome technological challenges to reach the US mainland. In its report to lawmakers, Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said that the Hwasong 14, which the North fired Tuesday morning, was most likely to be a new ICBM-range two-stage missile, a variant of the intermediate-range single-stage Hwasong-12 that the North launched in May. According to Reuters, the Pentagon also concluded Pyongyang test-fired an ICBM, reversing its initial assessment that the missile was a \u201cland-based IRBM.\u201dThe North claimed the missile flew about 2,800 kilometers with an apogee of 933 kilometers -- similar to the assessment of South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff -- meaning that that it could have flown at least 7,000 kilometers if fired at a range-maximizing angle. Any missile with a range in excess of 5,500 kilometers is classified as an ICBM by South Korea and the US. \u201cGiven the missile altitude, flight distance, speed, flight time, we believe (Hwasong 14) is a new ballistic missile with an ICBM range. \u2026 Our preliminary assessment is that the missile is a two-stage variant of KN-17,\u201d the ministry said, citing another name of Hwasong 12.South Korea and US forces stage a massive live-fire exercise at a training site near the East Sea on Wednesday. (Joint Chiefs of Staff)But the ministry was pessimistic about whether the North had secured key ICBM technologies, particularly a re-entry vehicle capable of withstanding extreme temperature and pressure when returning an ICBM back to Earth. Re-entry technology is considered to be the final component of an ICBM, which also requires a high-thrust engine, stage separation and guidance systems. Without a reliable re-entry vehicle, the missile could spring back to outer space or blow off in midair.\u201cThe success of re-entry technology is hard to see,\u201d Defense Minister Han Min-koo told the National Assembly\u2019s defense committee. \u201cIf North Korea wants to prove the missile is an ICBM, they have to show a warhead that can withstand at least 7,000 degrees Celsius.\u201d Han\u2019s remarks came after the North said that Tuesday\u2019s missile launch verified the carbon-made warhead\u2019s heat-resisting features during its atmospheric re-entry phase, where an ICBM faces a temperature as high as 8,000 degrees Celsius, traveling at about 7 kilometers per second.Pyongyang\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency said the missile\u2019s warhead had endured the \u201charsh condition\u201d of extreme temperate, overload and vibration and \u201cstably maintained\u201d its inner temperature between 25 and 45 degrees Celsius. \u201cThe test-launch was aimed to confirm the tactical and technological specifications and technological features of the newly developed intercontinental ballistic rocket capable of a carrying large-sized heavy nuclear warhead,\u201d KCNA said.Aerospace experts suspected that the North has yet to secure reliable re-entry technology, even though it appears clear that Pyongyang has inched closer to developing a nuclear-tipped ICBM capable of reaching the US mainland. Jang Young-geun, a professor of aerospace and mechanic engineering at Korea Aerospace University, said that unless North Korea presents \u201chard evidence,\u201d it is difficult to verify the North\u2019s claims about re-entry vehicle. \u201cFrom the perspective of an engineer, it is quite difficult to verify their claim unless they retrieve the missile that splashed down the sea, which I think is quite unlikely. Plus, North Korea didn\u2019t even mention about the re-entry vehicle when they made the ICBM announcement yesterday,\u201d said Jang. Jang also noted that an ICBM would be met with a \u201ccompletely different re-entry environment\u201d between when being deliberately fired at a lofty angle, as the North did Tuesday, and being launched at a normal angle during the actual combat. Robert Manning, an Atlantic Council expert, also expressed skepticism, saying Pyongyang is still three to four years away from developing a re-entry vehicle tipped with a nuclear warhead. It was not the first time that North Korea claimed their advance in re-entry technology. When the North fired the Hwasong 12, they touted the missile had come through \u201cthe worst re-entry situation\u201d and struck its intended target.With South Korea\u2019s military reserving its judgement, some intelligence officials suggested it could have been a success, claiming that the vehicle had successfully communicated with a data center on the ground after surviving extreme heat and vibration.

The two reaffirmed their commitment to fully exert pressure on North Korea, while at the same opening the door to dialogue under the right circumstances.They, however, differed on trade, with Trump complaining about an increase in the US deficit with South Korea since the two allies enforced the free trade agreement, suggesting the possibility of renegotiating the deal.Kang, who accompanied the president on his trip to Washington, said that the US side did not specifically mention the need for renegotiations but South Korean officials detected such an intention during the talks.\"We have not agreed to have renegotiations (on the FTA), nor have we started them,\" Kang said. \"Still, relevant ministries and agencies are now in consultation to draw up countermeasures against all possibilities.\"Meanwhile, assessing the overall outcome of the summit, Kang said South Korea has achieved all its intended objectives which were to build mutual trust and friendship between the leaders, secure Washington's support for the new government, and deepen the understanding of President Moon's vision and policy in its ally.

But since the new national unity government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed office in 2015, the social ambiance has relaxed and people are more open-minded about iconoclastic expression.\u00a0A scene from the film \u201cLet Her Cry,\u201d a tantalizing tale of an extramarital affair between an old professor and his seductive student (Let Her Cry)The film, directed by Asoka Handagama, portrays a complex web of psychological and physical interactions involving the professor and his young, bewitching student, and his devout wife, who all become distraught and caught between their carnal desires and moral obligations. Produced in 2015, the movie is set against the backdrop of modern Sri Lanka, still coming to grips with its postwar wounds and new societal challenges.\u00a0\u201cMy early films dealt with larger social issues of the war, gender and ethnic tensions, but this one is an experiment in a microscopic introspection of a modern Sri Lankan family, dealing with micro rather than macro issues,\u201d the director told The Korea Herald during the Sri Lankan Film Festival. The event was hosted by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Seoul and Korea Foundation.\u201cThe contemporary society is run by wanton, material desires and people are chasing one another. But such symptoms operate on both macro and micro levels. I have attempted to draw a larger picture of the society through my psychoanalytical film.\u201dThe audience reception has been generally positive, he said, mentioning that a famed 75-year-old singer married a 35-year-old woman following the movie\u2019s release, which some people attributed to the storyline. \u201cThings are changing. Society is becoming more liberal,\u201d the filmmaker said.\u00a0Sri Lankan film director Asoka Handagama (Asoka Handagama)Under the current liberal political climate, the country\u2019s market has also become liberalized and unregulated, Handagama explained. \u201cThe irony of all this is that we now have to compete with Hollywood and Bollywood head-on.\u201d\u00a0He continued by saying, \u201cWe have much more freedom to express our ideas, but it is also challenging to stay afloat in an industry dominated by big money and influence. Our principal challenge is to get our independent films released in theaters.\u201dAnomaa Rajakaruna, an independent curator who organized the Sri Lankan film festival in late June as part of celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Korea, said freedom has increased for artists and writers, who were previously confined to the straitjacket of censorship. Moving on from the government that banned certain films or cut parts of them, now the public film board classifies works according to age and content, she said.\u00a0Independent curator Anomaa Rajakaruna organized the Sri Lankan film festival in Seoul in late June (Sri Lankan Embassy)The multiplex theater CGV Myeongdong Station Cine Library, where the event was held, is a fine example of ensuring the visibility of diverse films, the curator highlighted.\u201cWith two arthouse screens and a public library, this theater is such a good example of guaranteeing the survival of both commercial and independent films,\u201d Rajakaruna said. \u201cCinema is not just about movies, but an entire culture of films. A place like this is conducive to nurturing a whole generation of film lovers, students and critics. This can be modelled and replicated in Sri Lanka.\u201dThe curator suggested Korean companies invest and build multiplexes in the Sri Lankan cinema industry, where standalone theatres dominate. Young generations of filmmakers in their late 20s and 30s are springing up across the country, she noted, adding they use cinematography as a medium of their newfound power and purpose. But in the absence of proper film schools and funding, they find it difficult to enter the industry and succeed. Most movies are produced in the Singhalese language in Sri Lanka, where Tamil and English are also spoken.\u00a0There are many societal questions stemming from the war and peace and stability, said the movie director.\u00a0Diplomats, including Sri Lankan Ambassador Manisha Gunasekera (fourth from right), filmmakers and officials pose at the Sri Lankan film festival in Seoul in late June (Sri Lankan Embassy)\u201cThere are issues related to the reconciliation between Tamil and Singhalese ethnic groups,\u201d he added, acknowledging his commitment to exposing the war\u2019s naked truths and lingering legacies. He is currently working on a co-production on the theme of reconciliation with two other filmmakers. The government also promotes art, theater and literature to help advance the reconciliatory efforts and promote social harmony, Handagama said. He also encouraged Korean filmmakers collaborate with Sri Lankan partners for co-production, noting the island nation offers countless picturesque sites as movie backgrounds.\u00a0Pointing to a host of cultural festivals in Sri Lanka, including the Fairway Galle Literary Festival, Colombo International Theatre Festival and Jaffna International Cinema Festival, he said, \u201cThe enthusiasm and interest for cinema are there. What we need are the political will and commercial investment to exploit these passions.\u201dBy Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)\u00a0 Sri Lankan Ambassador to Korea Manisha Gunasekera (center) participates in a cake-cutting ceremony at the National Day reception at Millennium Seoul Hilton on Feb. 3, 2016. (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)The following is an excerpt of an interview with Sri Lankan Ambassador to Korea Manisha Gunasekera.\u00a0The Korea Herald: Can you explain the significance of this year in the bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Korea in the cultural sphere? What kind of events does the embassy have in store for this year? Manisha Gunasekera: The year 2017 marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea. Bilateral relations were established between the two countries on 14 November, 1977.\u00a0The Embassy of Sri Lanka drew up a plan with 14 promotional events to be held this year to celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations. They included a Sri Lanka photo exhibition at the KF Gallery in Seoul (12-30 May 2017); a Sri Lanka Food Festival at the Millennium Seoul Hilton (17-26 May 2017); two Sri Lankan dance performances in Seoul and Gwangju by an internationally acclaimed dance troupe from Sri Lanka led by Master choreographer and percussionist Ravibandu Vidyapathi (19 and 21 May 2017); and a Sri Lanka Film Fest in Seoul (23 to 25 June). The cultural events were organised with the support of the Korea Foundation as well as Sri Lankan institutions, Korean companies and sponsors, whose cooperation we greatly appreciate and value.\u00a0On the economic front, a Korean business delegation visited Sri Lanka in May-June to participate in the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2017 in Colombo, and a delegation of importers from the Korea Importers\u2019 Association (KOIMA) led by its Chairman Shin Myoung-jin is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in the second half of this year.\u00a0\u00a0In terms of bilateral relations, the visit to Sri Lanka in March this year by former Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se on is significant. We look forward to the further exchange of high-level visits in the second part of this year, which would build on the existing cooperation and further consolidate our relations. KH: Can you explain the Sri Lankan film industry in comparison to Bollywood as well as where the industry stands in the service economy of Sri Lanka?\u00a0 MG: Sri Lanka has a highly developed art film industry that has evolved and come to its own since the 1950s. This is a niche cinema coveted by international film festivals and art cinema groups, but is not competing with Bollywood -- a large-scale, profitable film industry with a different formula.\u00a0Given the highly developed film industry of Korea, as well as the number of high-profile international festivals being hosted and organised here, including the Busan and Jeonju international film festivals, there is much potential synergy to be gained with Sri Lanka\u2019s contemporary artistic cinema. Several of these contemporary Sri Lankan art films have been screened at international film festivals in Korea.\u00a0The Sri Lanka Film Fest, organised by our embassy with the support of Korea Foundation and other institutions in Seoul, offered the Korean public a very rare opportunity to view a good cross-section of contemporary Sri Lankan films covering different genres, produced largely by third-generation cinematographers. We therefore called it a retrospective of our contemporary cinema.KH: What are the key pillars of bilateral cultural cooperation? What can both countriesdo more to promote bilateral cultural, social, culinary tourism and educational exchanges?\u00a0 MG: Food, dance, music, theatre, cinema, tourism and youth are key pillars of our cultural cooperation in my view. I am glad that we were able to exhibit Sri Lanka\u2019s culture and artistic traditions in Korea this year through a series of events.\u00a0For example, the Sri Lanka photo exhibition, food festival, film festival, and dance performances also helped promote Sri Lanka as an attractive tourism destination among the Korean people. Sri Lanka is an exotic country Korean people are beginning to discover. I particularly wanted young people of Korea to get to know Sri Lanka.\u00a0In terms of educational exchanges, we have over 200 Sri Lankan students pursuing their undergraduate and postgraduate studies at leading Korean universities. This is a professional community and an elite group that will also function as ambassadors for Korea in the future.\u00a0Sri Lanka also offers a presidential scholarship for higher education open to Korean students. We hope to see more Korean students making use of such opportunities to study in Sri Lanka. There are also several exchanges between institutions of higher education between the two countries with great potential for further expansion.KH: Can you explain the recognition of Korean culture, food, pop culture and movies in Sri Lanka? If Korean culture is not yet visibly popular in your country, do you think there is room for expansion into the Sri Lankan market by drawing on the commonalities of democracy, Asian culture and Buddhism?\u00a0 MG: Korean television dramas are extremely popular in Sri Lanka with several of them being telecast at prime time on national TV. Korean actress Lee Young-ae is extremely popular and much beloved as a household name, following the screening of series \u201cJewel in the Palace (Dae Jang Geum)\u201d in Sri Lanka a few years back.\u00a0The drama also made Korea familiar to Sri Lankan people. Lee Young-ae recently received much attention again for her generous support for victims of floods and landslides in Sri Lanka in June. Similarly, hallyu or the k-wave is popular among the youth in Sri Lanka.\u00a0 The K-wave is a lucrative industry for which there is a good market in Sri Lanka.\u00a0Although Sri Lanka and Korea are Asian countries, they are located rather far from each other. But we share an Asian heritage as well as historical links of Buddhism that runs like a fine silk thread between us, thus strongly binding the two sides together. I would also encourage more scholarly research on Buddhist cultural links between the two countries, which go back some15 centuries and more. Such research would spark people\u2019s interest in history as well as shed light on its relevance to our present time.\u00a0Sri Lanka also has a longstanding democratic tradition, being one of the first democracies in the post-colonial world when the country gained independence in 1948. The Republic of Korea too has a highly developed democratic tradition with meticulous attention to improving its democratic institutions and their functioning. This is worthy of emulation, especially by countries such as Sri Lanka, which are also in the process of strengthening their democratic institutions. KH: Can you highlight international film festivals and literary events in Sri Lanka? How has the democratization process in your country under the current government helped the flourishing of cultural industries, media freedom and civil liberty?\u00a0 MG: The current national unity Government in Sri Lanka led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe came into office in 2015 on an overwhelming mandate to establish good governance, the rule of law, transparency and accountability in the country. In this process, the government has paid much attention to strengthening democratic institutions. In such an environment, the space available for creative arts, media freedom and the exercise of civil liberties is significant.\u00a0Having said, that, I must say there has always been a blossoming of cultural and artistic expressions in Sri Lanka, even during the period of internal conflict. Given Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic location along the east-west sea and air routes, historical legacy of colonialism, trade links with the outside world since ancient times, island culture, as well as large diasporas worldwide, we have always remained cosmopolitan and open to the world.\u00a0The Sri Lankan society is a melting pot of cultures.\u00a0 This has given rise to different and vibrant forms of artistic expression through literature, art, theatre and music. There are many Sri Lankan writers as well as writers of Sri Lankan origin who have won wide international acclaims, such as Michael Ondaarje and Shyam Selvadurai.\u00a0\u00a0The Galle Literary Festival -- an annual event in the beautiful and historic Dutch fort city of Galle -- is the result of such cosmopolitanism. This festival is now an attractive international literary event that brings together writers, critics and book-lovers from the South Asian sub-continent and the world. I would like to also see Korean participation in this festival in the future.The Jaffna Film Festival has provided a valuable opportunity for the people of Jaffna, particularly youths, to view acclaimed international films as well as quality movies produced in the country and region. This is significant given that Jaffna, located in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, is in the heart of areas\u00a0formerly devastated by the conflict. The region has seen significant\u00a0socioeconomic progress since the onset of peace in 2009.","523":"President Moon Jae-in on Monday renewed his intention to use sports occasions to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and engage an increasingly isolated and belligerent North Korea, pinning hopes on the upcoming Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea. \u201cIf North Korea participates, it will not only contribute to the Olympic spirit, but also to peace in the region and the world, and to the harmony of mankind,\u201d Moon said during a one-on-one meeting with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.\u00a0 President Moon Jae-in recieves IOC chief Thomas Bach at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Monday.

(Yonhap)Conservative governments have a tough stance toward North Korea, while liberal administrations seek dialogue and engagement with Pyongyang.President Moon Jae-in has vowed to seek a dual-track approach of denuclearizing North Korea and seeking dialogue with the North.His critics and conservative blocs claimed that Moon is too soft toward the North.\"The government is reviewing ways (to reflect their opinions) for the policy that can remain intact beyond the ideological spectrum,\" a ministry official said.The two Koreas technically remain at war, as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not with a peace treaty.Kim Nam-jung, the head of the ministry's unification policy office, unveiled an idea of such a body at a forum on North Korea held last Thursday.

Seven other member states of the United Nations Command -- Australia, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Britain -- are also taking part in it.There's no report of the US dispatching such high-profile weapons as aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines or strategic bombers to the training. \"UFG is computer simulated defensive exercise designed to enhance readiness, protect the region and maintain stability on the Korean peninsula,\" it said.Officials from the two countries denied speculation that links the decrease in the number of US participants to an effort to cool down tensions on the peninsula.Defense officials here pointed out that UFG is largely a war game, rather than a field exercise like Foal Eagle held in the spring. They said the number of participating troops can slightly change depending on the emphasis of the training events each a year.This year's UFG comes amid brewing speculation about the future of the Seoul-Washington alliance as the allies are under growing pressure to downsize their regular combined military training, which Pyongyang views as a rehearsal for a northern invasion.Last week, Stephen K. Bannon, a key aide to President Donald Trump, openly raised the possibility of a deal to withdraw American troops from South Korea in return for a verifiable freeze in the North's nuclear program. He was later dismissed from the White House chief strategist post.On a recent trip to Northeast Asia, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refuted the view that a troop pullout is being considered. He emphasized the US has a \"long-term alliance commitment\" to the defense of South Korea.The North launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July and announced a plan for a strike near Guam with four mid-range missiles.Trump issued a warning of unprecedented \"fire and fury.\"The two sides are at an uneasy truce in the war of words after the North said its leader Kim Jong-un has ordered his armed forces to hold off on the Guam attack scheme and see how the US acts.The allies are on alert for possible North Korean provocations aimed at protesting the practice and driving a wedge between them.Last year, the North fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) in the East Sea two days after the opening of UFG. It also launched three Scud missiles on the last day of the training followed by a nuclear test four days later.President Moon Jae-in urged the North to refrain from making additional provocative acts on the pretext of the drills being defensive in nature.North Korea watchers said the North's attitude during and shortly after the UFG period will be a critical factor in the security condition here in the coming months, with the South and the US trying to bring it to the bargaining table. The North will celebrate its founding anniversary on Sept. 9.

The Treasury Department declared the Bank of Dandong a \u201cprimary money-laundering concern,\u201d proposing to sever it entirely from the US financial system, pending a 60-day review period. Although Trump\u2019s treasury secretary said the move didn\u2018t target China, it comes a week after the president lamented that China\u2019s promise to help with North Korea \u201chas not worked out.\u201d  Trump had been leaning on President Xi Jinping to help stop the North\u2018s development of nuclear weapons before they can threaten the US homeland. A main focus of the coordination has been getting China to fully enforce international sanctions intended to starve North Korea of revenue for its nuclear and missile programs. The US action is likely to anger China, which handles about 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s external trade, and whose banks and companies are said to provide Pyongyang access to the US-dominated international financial system.  (Yonhap)The sanctions bar Americans from doing business with Bank of Dandong, which is based in a northeastern Chinese city on the North Korean border that serves as a gateway for trade with the isolated nation. The US also slapped sanctions Thursday on a Chinese shipping company and two Chinese people that it said have facilitated illegal activities by North Korea. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the US still wants to work with Beijing on combating the North Korean threat.\u201cWe are in no way targeting China with these actions,\u201d Mnuchin told a White House news briefing.The punitive steps were presaged by a tweet from Trump last week reflecting dissatisfaction with Beijing\u2018s efforts.\u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!\u201d Trump tweeted on June 20.The Trump administration may be struggling to maintain international pressure on Pyongyang.The president was to meet for the first time Thursday with South Korea\u2019s new leader, President Moon Jae-in, who has long advocated outreach to North Korea. His predecessor had staunchly backed Trump\u2018s harder line. Mnuchin said the Bank of Dandong has facilitated millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea\u2019s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert and former Treasury Department official, described it as a small Chinese bank \u201csitting at the heart\u201d of trade between North Korea and China.\u201cThis is a strong message to Chinese leaders that the Trump administration will act against North Korea\u2018s sanctions evasion in China,\u201d he said.The other targeted Chinese entities are:Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co., which Treasury accused of transporting 700,000 tons of freight annually, including coal and steel products, between China and North Korea. It cited a UN expert panel as saying the company has violated a ban on trade in luxury goods with the North.Chinese national Sun Wei, said to have been running a cover company for North Korea\u2019s Foreign Trade Bank, which is already subject to US sanctions.Chinese national Li Hong Ri, said to have established several front companies that end up benefiting Koryo Bank, a US-sanctioned conduct for financial transactions on behalf of North Korea.","536":"South Korea's culture ministry announced Thursday that the slogan for Korea's national image introduced last year is no longer in use.The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said it got rid of the slogan \"Creative Korea\" as it seems neither to have produced any positive effects in enhancing the country's national image abroad nor to have been supported by the public.

Those who disapproved of his job performance made up 18.6 percent, up 1.2 percentage points, while 7.1 percent said they were unsure or refused to answer.South Korean President Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)Last week, opposition parties criticized Moon's special adviser Moon Chung-in's remarks over the idea of downsizing South Korea-US military exercises in return for North Korea's nuclear freeze. The Yonsei University professor later said the idea was from his \"scholarly belief.\"Opposition parties also continued to denounce Moon's controversial personnel choices, including Defense Minister nominee Song Young-moo. Song has been dogged by a range of allegations, including seemingly exorbitant payments for his advisory role at a law firm and a defense company, and false address registration.Moon's support rating declined the most in the southeastern region of Busan, South Gyeongsang Province and Ulsan (6.2 percentage points), followed by the central region of Daejeon, the Chungcheong Provinces and Sejong (4.5 percentage points).By age, support fell the most among those in their 40s (2.1 percentage points), followed by those in their 50s (1.6 percentage points).In the survey, the rating for the ruling Democratic Party remained unchanged at 53.6 percent, while support for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party declined 0.2 percentage point to 14.5 percent. The ratings for the People's Party and Justice Party were tallied at 6.3 percent each, while the figure for the Bareun Party stood at 6.2 percent.The survey, commissioned by the local broadcaster CBS, was conducted on 2,531 adults across the country and had a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points with a 95 percent confidence level. (Yonhap)","552":"Suspending annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea could lead to a weakening of the alliance, a former chief US nuclear negotiator with North Korea said.Former Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill made the point in a recent Project Syndicate article, expressing concern about the \"freeze-for-freeze\" idea that calls for the US freezing or scaling back the exercises in exchange for the North freezing nuclear and missile testing.\"Advocates of this so-called 'freeze for freeze' approach say that such a tradeoff is only fair: The North cannot be expected to suspend its efforts to strengthen its defensive capabilities if the US and South Korea are pursuing supposedly hostile military cooperation in its near abroad,\" Hill said. (Yonhap)\"But this argument has it backward. In fact, it is the North whose activities are inherently hostile, and the South, along with the US, that is focused on defense. Indeed, planning for the annual US-South Korea spring exercises is always based on the premise that North Korea has invaded the South, not vice versa,\" he said.Hill also stressed, \"Without joint exercises, a military alliance becomes weak and hollow.\"He cited Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland as an example. Upon the invasion, Britain and France declared war on Germany in accordance with their mutual defense treaty but did little to protect the ally, and Germany subjugated Poland quickly, he said.\"If the US suspends joint military exercises with South Korea, its willingness or ability to respond to North Korean aggression in the South may become similarly weak,\" Hill said.The \"freeze-for-freeze\" proposal is all the more dangerous, given the possibility that the suspension of missile and nuclear tests may not actually lead to a concomitant weakening of North Korea's nuclear program, he said, adding that testing is only a small element of a weapons program and not necessarily an essential one. Hill also rejected the perceptions that Pyongyang would give up its nuclear program in exchange for a security guarantee, saying the 2005 six-party deal he negotiated with the North included not only a security guarantee but also economic and other concessions, but the North ultimately reneged on the agreement.\"The idea that North Korea will abandon its weapons programs in exchange for the promise of security and regime survival has been tested, has failed whenever it has been tested,\" Hill said, referring to the 2005 agreement.Hill said that a stronger and more purposeful US-China dialogue on the North is essential to resolving \"what is emerging as the world's most urgent security problem.\"\"But the discussion should focus on direct measures to impede and undermine the country's inherently aggressive nuclear program-- not to offer more concessions that will only strengthen a rogue regime's hand,\" he said.

The WTF World Taekwondo Championships kicked off Saturday.Also at the table were Chang Ung, the lone North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee, Yu Zaiqing, an IOC vice president, and Lee Hee-beom, president of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics organizing committee.

(WTF)Chang traveled to Muju with a delegation from the North Korea-led International Taekwondo Federation, whose demonstration team had a performance during the WTF event's opening ceremony.Also at Saturday's opening ceremony, South Korean President Moon Jae-in extended his invitation to North Korea to take part in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games. Only days earlier, Seoul's sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, proposed assembling a joint women's hockey team and holding skiing events at North Korea's Masikryong resort at the 2018 Olympics.After Sunday's meeting, An told reporters that Moon's proposal was discussed over lunch and that it's a delicate issue that requires discussions with many different parties.\"We have to have a counterpart on matters related to inter-Korean sports exchanges,\" An said. \"It'd be great if we got our wish, but we have to get North Korea, the IOC and international federations of winter sports involved. This requires multilateral talks. Our president gave us a big framework, and we have to try to make something out of that.\"An, who has represented South Korea in previous inter-Korean sports talks, said time isn't on South Korea's side.\"The Olympics won't wait for us,\" An said. \"But the nature of sports talks is such that, once the leaderships of both Koreas make their political decision, things can really pick up the pace and it could lead to great results.\"An said since there is still much uncertainty surrounding the peninsula, the two Koreas would be wise to approach their sports exchange talks carefully.\"It could be summer or autumn, but if we do hold a new round of sports talks, we could discuss PyeongChang Winter Olympics within that framework,\" An said. \"I think we're now at a point where we're trying to improve the quality of our discussions.\"According to An, Chang is taking a wait-and-see approach and wanted to see if North Korean athletes could actually qualify for the PyeongChang Games first. North Korea didn't participate in the previous Winter Games in Sochi three years ago.For PyeongChang, North Korea has its one last shot in pairs figure skating. Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik just missed out on qualification at the International Skating Union World Figure Skating Championships in Helsinki, and will take one more crack at an Olympic berth at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Oberstdorf, Germany, in September.

If a North Korean delegation takes part in the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, I believe it will greatly contribute to realizing the Olympic values of friendship and peace,\" President Moon said, according to a script of his remarks released by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul.Also present at the opening of the taekwondo championships in Muju were Chang Ung, North Korea's sole member of the International Olympic Committee, and Ri Yong-son, the North Korean head of the ITF.President Moon especially extended his welcome to the two, noting their journey to South Korea must have been the longest. Before his speech, Moon shook hands with Chang and exchanged a few words with him.South Korea and North Korea remain divided and technically at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended only with an armistice and not a peace treaty.Earlier this week, Seoul's new sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, suggested forming a joint Korean team in women's hockey and holding skiing events at North Korea's Masikryong resort during PyeongChang 2018.The ideas may well get some traction, as IOC President Thomas Bach is scheduled to visit Muju for the WTF championships' closing ceremony next Friday. During his stay, Bach is expected to discuss the issue with relevant parties.In his speech, Moon said he'd once again like to feel the emotions from watching the joint march of the two Koreas in the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Moon also made references to the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship, two competitions where the Koreas fielded joint teams.After the Sydney Games, the two Koreas also had joint marches at the 2002 Busan Asian Games, 2003 Aomori Asian Winter Games, 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, 2006 Torino Winter Olympics, 2006 Doha Asian Games and 2007 Changchun Asian Winter Games.For a joint march in PyeongChang to materialize, North Korea must first qualify to compete in the Olympics.

Yoon Young-chan, chief presidential press secretary, speaks during a press briefing at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on May 31, 2017. (Yonhap)Quoting unidentified US sources, the Japanese daily said such a request was filed by Thomas Shannon, US undersecretary of state for political affairs, during his trip to Seoul earlier this month.Yoon Young-chan, the chief press secretary for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, flatly dismissed the report, calling it \"incorrect.\"\"The Asahi Shimbun's report that US Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon demanded the deployment of the THAAD before the year's end in a meeting with our government officials is not true,\" the Cheong Wa Dae official said in a released statement.The Japanese newspaper earlier claimed the South Korean presidential office had refused to extend a warm welcome to US Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), forcing him to cancel his trip to Seoul.Yoon also called the earlier report \"false.\"\"Cheong Wa Dae expresses its deep regrets against the news outlet that has repeatedly published false reports about Undersecretary Shannon, following its report on Sen.

It usually leaves it to the Pentagon or refers media to South Korea's defense ministry.It came a day after a foreign news report said that Moon, a liberal leader who took office in early May, took issue with the timeline of the deployment of the US strategic asset on the peninsula.In an interview with Reuters, Moon was quoted as saying that just one THAAD interceptor launcher was originally scheduled to be installed this year, with five others to arrive in 2018.In fact, two THAAD rocket launchers are in place at a former golf course in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. Four others were brought to South Korea earlier this year and stored at a local USFK base.Work on the THAAD installation has been suspended as the Moon administration is reviewing the relevant domestic procedures including the scope of a new environmental impact assessment. The THAAD issue is expected to be high on the agenda when Moon holds his first summit talks with US President Donald Trump in Washington D.C. next week.Moon told Reuters that he will request that Chinese President Xi Jinping lift Beijing's measures of economic retaliation against Seoul in connection with THAAD, when they have a chance to meet in Germany next month on the sidelines of a G-20 summit.South Korea and the US reached a deal on deploying a THAAD battery on the peninsula in March last year, two months after North Korea's fourth nuclear test. South Korea was under the administration of a conservative president, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached later amid a bribery and influence-peddling scandal.A THAAD battery is known to require at least six truck-mounted launchers. Eight interceptors are loaded per launcher as they can be fired and rapidly reloaded, according to the US Missile Defense Agency.It also comes with a powerful X-band radar, which searches, tracks, discriminates objects and provides updated tracking data to the interceptor, a battery support center and a fire control & communication system.Speaking by phone in March this year, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo and his American counterpart Jim Mattis \"discussed the alliance's responses concerning the THAAD deployment to the USFK,\" announced their offices. THAAD stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.

This is the end of one great show, but just the beginning to hundreds of new spinoffs.\"Local media said about 2,500 people well-wishers lined up outside the school's arts center to pay respects to Warmbier. The service was conducted by a rabbi and lasted about one hour. Blue and white ribbons (the school's colors) adorned trees around the school to honor Warmbier.In attendance was Amb.

South Korea and China have been at odds over the deployment of a US missile shield called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense\u00a0 system, which is being installed in South Korea.Beijing claims it could harm its strategic interest.Back in 2010, many South Korean businesspeople and their families began to settle in Wangjing joining the bandwagon of \"hallyu,\" or Korean Wave, in China.According to data released by the South Korean Embassy in Beijing, the number of South Koreans who stayed more than six months in China last year reached about 300,000. About 95,000 South Koreans reside in Beijing and Tianjin, northeastern China; 60,000 in Shanghai and the Huadong region; and65,000 in Qingdao and the Shandong region.The Koreatown in Wangjing is home to about 10,000 South Koreans, an exemplification of \"Little Korea in China\" that boasts of well-established infrastructure. Once a rural village in the vicinity of Beijing, Wangjing saw South Korean supermarkets, churches, hair salons and markets spring up following the settlement of South Korean residents and businesspeople.Living in Wangjing gives South Koreans a sense of home as popular Korean foods including boiled pig trotter \"jokbal\" and fried chicken and beer, or \"chimaek,\" are available, sometimes faster than back home. \u00a0\"Wangjing was the countryside with an empty field just 15 years ago,\" said the owner of a supermarket in Wangjing's Xiyuan Sanqu district, who declined to be named. \"As many South Koreans got to live together and various amenities were introduced, Chinese people also came in with the idea of Wangjing being a good place to live in spreading by word of mouth.\"In Wangjing, South Korean companies and vendors benefited from a business boom on the crest of the South Korean culture wave.Since 2010, however, they were battered by decreasing competitiveness and increasing manpower costs, losing out to local counterparts. Chinese customers browse products at an outlet of the South Korean discount store chain Lotte Mart in Beijing`s Wangjing district, also known as Koreatown, in this file photo taken on March 2, 2017. (Yonhap)The South Korean community, including Wangjing, has found itself at the center of the ongoing THAAD row since July last year, when Seoul announced that the country would host the defense system.The decision has caused its relations with China to plunge to their lowest level in many years, with South Korean businesses in China struggling under what Seoul sees as retaliatory measures.Many South Koreans closed their restaurants and removed any mention of South Korea from signs in the face of moves to boycott South Korean products and eateries coupled with growing anti-South Korean sentiment.Apartments and houses evacuated by South Korean businesspeople have been taken up by the Chinese middle class and Chinese young people working for foreign-invested companies.The phenomenon of hollowing out is seen in not only Wangjing but other areas where a large population of South Korea residents live.Choi Chung-gwang, a South Korean businessman who started a Korean restaurant in 1993, just one year after the establishment of diplomatic ties between Seoul and Beijing, said the hallyu boom in the 2000s helped raise the popularity of South Korean restaurants and products. \"But South Korean companies have lost their competitiveness due to China's continued development and the THAAD row drove the South Korean community to a level seen as the worst ever,\" he said.Choi has switched his business to an artificial intelligence-based catering service for pet dogs. \"It's about time we ought to explore more technological and creative business sectors in which Chinese people cannot catch up with us,\" he added.

(Yonhap)The first inter-Korean taekwondo exchange in nearly a decade, the visit comes as President Moon is openly expressing hopes to re-engage the North with diplomacy and dialogue, amid Pyongyang\u2019s relentless pursuit of nuclear and missile programs.\u201cTo resolve the issue we have to add dialogue to the current menu of sanctions and pressure,\u201d Moon said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.The Moon administration is also drawing up plans for a possible inter-Korean sports team for the upcoming 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to paint the event as the \u201cPeace Olympics.\u201d \u201cThere are plans to talk with the IOC to create an inter-Korean women\u2019s hockey team,\u201d Do Jong-hwan, South Korea\u2019s new sports minister, said Tuesday. \u201cHopefully, we\u2018ll be able to thaw lingering tensions as we try to bring North Korea on board.\u201d Do also added that Thomas Bach, president of the IOC and who is scheduled to attend the closing ceremony of the taekwondo championship, has plans to meet Moon on July 3, upon the president\u2019s arrival from Seoul-Washington bilateral summit. The meeting is expected to be an opportunity for Moon to roll out his ideas for the Peace Olympics. President Moon himself also expressed hopes for the two Koreas to collaborate in the bidding process to host the 2030 World Cup. \u201cIf the neighboring countries in Northeast Asia, including North and South Korea, can host the World Cup together, it would help to create peace in North and South Korea as well as Northeast Asia,\u201d Moon said earlier this month, according to the president\u2019s spokesperson Park Su-hyun. The upcoming taekwondo event is expected to be the largest world championship of the sport, indigenous to Korea, to date, with a record number of 971 athletes from 183 nations registered to compete. South Korea\u2019s Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung will attend the event with the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism overseeing the tournament, according to a Ministry of Unification official Thursday. Demonstration teams from each federation will hold a joint performance choreographed for the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony, marking the first time it is being showcased in South Korea. The WTF, headquartered in Seoul, is a control tower for taekwondo worldwide with the IOC\u2019s support. The ITF, although sanctioned by the North Korean regime, is headquartered in Vienna.

The road forming the boundary between Gyeongbokgung and the Blue House will be open at all times, according to Park.People will also be allowed to take photographs from any angle toward the presidential house, except at guard posts and security-related facilities. Taking photographs in the direction of the presidential office, including from the mountain behind it, has long been restricted. Access to roads around Cheong Wa Dae has been restricted from 8 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. since North Korea\u2019s 1968 assassination attempt on then-President Park Chung-hee. Even during the day, free public access has been relatively limited in the neighborhood, as passers-by were often intimidated by the massive barricades and guards.\u201cThis will mark a significant move for Cheong Wa Dae to break free from its authoritarian image and advance into the Gwanghwamun era,\u201d the spokesperson said, referring to President Moon\u2019s election vow to open up to the public.Joo Young-hoon, chief of the presidential security office, offered an apology to those who live near the presidential office for the inconvenience over the past decades.\u201cDrones, however, will continue to be excluded from the photo permission as they are potential threats on security and this issue remains to be solved,\u201d Joo added.The security chief also reported that the Blue House saved some 2 billion won ($1.8 million) by cutting its special activities funds, based on the state chief\u2019s vow not to waste taxpayers\u2019 money for his private use.\u201cOf the amount, 1.6 billion won will be used to create new jobs in the public sector, while the rest will go to recruitment for the security office, which, under the recent circumstances, needs to be reinforced in manpower,\u201d Joo said.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","565":"The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Thursday that it has selected 5,000 recipients for its cash subsidy program for unemployed youth, which will run from July. The subsidy amount is 500,000 won ($439) per month for up to six months. Providing cash is the most practical and effective way to help underprivileged youth to escape long-term unemployment, Seoul officials said. The recipients consist of 2,629 women and 2,371 men who were unemployed for about 20 months on average. About 60 percent of them are graduates from four-year courses in universities.A banner of youth subsidy, put up by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2016. (Yonhap)\u201cAlong with the cash subsidies, the city government plans to provide support in terms of job preparation such as mentoring services,\u201d said Jeon Hyo-kwan, an official of the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The Seoul Metropolitan Government first brought up the idea of the youth subsidy program in November 2015, stressing that cash allowances would help jobless youth to escape \u201ca vicious circle of having to earn money first in order to study to land jobs.\u201d The program, however, was opposed by the previous conservative Park Geun-hye administration. Nevertheless, it distributed the first cash handouts to 2,831 recipients in August last year, prompting the Ministry of Health and Welfare to issue a correction order. After the impeachment of the former president, the ministry reserved its stance on the program. Critics have raised concerns toward the program, questioning whether the money would really be spent on job searches and preparation. City officials argued that the selection process was fair and transparent and that recipients will be required to submit receipts and a report on how they used the stipend. Meanwhile, separate data from Statistics Korea showed that the number of long-term unemployed people here hit a 13-year high in May, with some 120,000 people looking for work for six months or longer.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","566":"South Korea will mark the 67th anniversary of the Korean War's outbreak this week with several commemorative events, bringing together war veterans at home and abroad.The war broke out at dawn on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel, which was then the demarcation line between the two Koreas drawn by the United States and the Soviet Union following World War II.The war lasted three years resulting in huge casualties before the 1953 Armistice Agreement suspended the conflict.This year's official commemoration ceremony, to be held at Jamsil Stadium in southern Seoul on Sunday, will gather together some 5,000 participants, including foreign war veterans and envoys from countries that sent troops to fight for South Korea as part of allied United Nations forces, according to the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.

Last month, the rate was tallied at 3.6 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from the same month last year.At the National Assembly, the political standoff over the budget bill showed no signs of abating.Opposition parties grew more combative as Moon has pressed ahead with the appointments of Kim Sang-jo as Fair Trade Commission chairman and Kang Kyung-wha as foreign minister despite their alleged ethical lapses.A parliamentary deliberation committee has yet to bring the budget bill up for a review, as the main opposition Liberty Korea Party (LKP), People's Party and Bareun Party remain opposed to the idea of using the budget for creating jobs in the public sector.

(Yonhap)People\u2019s Party will boldly support Moon when needed: party chief Japan's education ministry earlier announced its education handbook for elementary and middle schools in which it calls for students to be taught that Dokdo is its territory.The move came as a follow-up measure to its revision to education guidelines in which it repeated its claims to the islets. The guidelines and the handbook serve as a standard by which students are taught and textbooks are written.The handbook is aimed at specifying how to teach students and will be used in schools in phases from 2020. It, in particular, calls for students to be taught that Dokdo is part of Japan's territory and South Korea has occupied it illegally.Dokdo, a set of rocky islets lying closer to the Korean Peninsula in the East Sea, has long been a recurring source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since the liberation of the Korean Peninsula from Japan in 1945 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.Japan has repeatedly claimed that Dokdo is its own territory, drawing strong condemnation from South Korea.This latest territorial claim is expected to worsen the already frayed diplomatic relations between the neighbors as they have been at odds over a controversial deal reached in 2015 on Japan's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women.Under the deal, both agreed to \"finally and irreversibly\" resolve the so-called comfort women issue. Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.Critics, however, call into question the sincerity of the apology, as Japan refused to recognize its legal responsibility for the forced mobilization of the women. They also criticized the deal for being hastily arranged without sufficiently seeking the opinions of the victims.President Moon Jae-in said in his telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe following his inauguration last month that many South Koreans cannot accept the deal \"emotionally,\" hinting that his government might be in pursuit of changes to it. Speaking over the phone with her Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida earlier in the day, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha also called for joint efforts to \"wisely\" resolve the comfort women issue, emphasizing that a majority of people here and victims cannot accept the 2015 deal, the ministry said.Kishida, however, reiterated Japan's stance, saying that the deal reached between governments should be \"faithfully\" enforced, according to Seoul's ministry.

So I think it's important to note that the inspected individuals in this case are not exempt from inspection at our nation's ports of entry or departure,\" she said.\"I understand that this was an action that was undertaken by the Department of Homeland Security, so I would refer you to them for any details. I don't have any other details of the inspection or what was found in the course of the inspection.\" (Yonhap)","580":"President Moon Jae-in's policy advisory panel said Monday that the government will seek to introduce an enhanced public defender system to offer legal aid to low-income citizens in criminal cases starting in the investigation phase.The move is in line with Moon's pledge to strengthen the protection of citizens' human rights.

The world\u2019s average number of used paid vacation days is 20, while Korea is the only country under 10 days, according to the data.The findings also showed that 48 percent of Korean workers answered that a tight work schedule and lack of substitute workers were reasons for not using up all their annual leave.\u201cKorean workers have a very long working time. But they can\u2019t use vacations properly and their leisure time is relatively low, causing a serious imbalance of work and leisure,\u201d said Kim Ji-hak, a researcher at the KCTI.He added that if workers used all of the statutory annual leave, the country may create a considerable number of jobs and it could have a greater economic ripple effect.By Byun Hee-jin (hjbandi9@heraldcorp.com)","582":"President Moon Jae-in on Sunday pushed ahead with the appointment of Kang Kyung-wha as foreign minister, despite fierce resistance from opposition parties over his choice of Cabinet members.The decision put the liberal leader on a collision course with the opposition holding an outright majority in the unicameral parliament when key agendas are pending, including the supplementary budget and government reorganization plans.\u201cIt is regrettable that the parliament (continued to oppose the appointment), but with the imminent Korea-US summit and the Group of 20 summit to follow, we could no longer leave the Foreign Ministry post unfilled,\u201d Moon told Kang, after presenting her with a certificate of appointment.\u201cIt is now up to (you) to show your capacity, as you have done in the international community, so that those who opposed (your nomination) may change their mind.\u201dPresident Moon Jae-in (right) shakes hands with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa after she was formally appointed at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)Kang pledged to exert her best efforts in preparing for the Korea-US summit and to meet with her US counterpart, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, prior to Moon\u2019s departure for Washington later next week.Shortly after the presidential conferment ceremony, Kang headed to the ministry to receive reports on the upcoming summit and updates on North Korea\u2019s nuclear provocations, according to ministry officials.\u201cThe Korea-US summit is just around the corner so I have come to follow up on the preparations,\u201d Kang told reporters while entering the building, saving further remarks until after the inauguration ceremony.Kang\u2018s inauguration as the nation\u2019s first female foreign minister is to take place Monday at the Seoul Government Complex building.The foreign minister\u2019s appointment drew divided responses from the political circle.The ruling liberal Democratic Party of Korea stressed the urgent need to activate the Cabinet and the pressing political timeline for the bilateral summit, while the largely conservative opposition accused the president of a power monopoly and lack of communication.Further kindling the controversies over Moon\u2019s choice of Cabinet members was Ahn Kyong-whan, the justice minister nominee who stepped down Friday amid disputes over his sexist comments and a forged marriage registration in his 20s without the consent of his then-girlfriend.\u201cThe president shall not have the opposition\u2019s cooperation over the (revision of) the Government Organization Act or the supplementary budget bill,\u201d Rep. Kim Myung-yeon, chief spokesperson of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, said in a statement.The hard-line conservative opposition also held a floor meeting in the afternoon to discuss protest actions, including mass boycotts of pending parliamentary schedules.The centrist People\u2019s Party and the minority conservative Bareun Party also complained that the president shut out the opposition\u2019s feedback on Kang\u2019s qualifications.\u201cDuring her confirmation hearing, Minister Kang honestly admitted her faults and offered a sincere apology,\u201d ruling party spokesperson Rep. Kim Hyun said in a statement, welcoming the appointment.\u201cIt is the people\u2019s hope that (the government) should fully brace for the Korea-US summit and the G-20 summit.\u201dPresident Moon Jae-in (right) walks with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha after the appointment ceremony at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)Though announced on May 21, only 10 days after Moon\u2019s swearing-in, Kang\u2019s nomination has been in deadlock for the past four weeks due to what the opposition saw as ethical lapses, including her past record of a false residence registration.Though the flaw had been considered trivial in hearings held under former administrations, the opposition related it to Moon\u2019s earlier vow to strictly exclude rule-breakers from high-profile government posts.The fact that the presidential office had pre-emptively revealed the violation, asking for the people\u2019s understanding on the matter, did little to alleviate the backlash from the opposition camp.The political divide grew even further as Moon decided last Tuesday to appoint Kim Sang-jo as chairman of the Fair Trade Commission without parliamentary consensus.While the appointment of prime minister, Constitutional Court chief, Supreme Court chief, and Board of Audit and Inspection chief require the approval of the full parliamentary floor, minister-level Cabinet members may take office upon presidential designation, if the Assembly fails to set its stance within due time.As the approval of Kang\u2019s nomination was thwarted last Wednesday, Moon immediately requested on the following day for the Assembly to endorse her report by Saturday, effectively telling opposition parties that he would appoint her regardless of their decision.\u201cOur Constitution and laws are very clear on the authority of the president and of the legislature upon government personnel,\u201d Moon said Thursday in his weekly meeting with the secretariat, hinting at moving ahead with Kang\u2019s appointment.The confirmation hearing and the consequent parliamentary process of endorsing the hearing report are supplementary means to thoroughly verify the qualification of minister nominees, he also added.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","583":"A woman in her 30s was detained Saturday after two babies were found dead in her home freezer, police said Sunday.

Known for her experience in human rights and global assistance at the United Nations, Kang was tapped to lead the ministry last month and went through a confirmation hearing.Her official appointment, however, had been delayed due to strong objections by opposition parties which saw her unfit for the post citing her past wrongdoings such as alleged tax evasion and false registration of address for her daughter.Kang's appointment also has raised concerns over her inexperience in the major diplomatic areas such as North Korea and its nuclear crisis. Still she has spawned expectation that she could expand the country's diplomatic horizon by going beyond its major power-oriented diplomacy and reform the organization.Kang is the first woman to lead the ministry and the first case in 14 years in which it is headed by a person who didn't start as a career diplomat. She is to assume her duties officially on Monday. (Yonhap)","585":"WASHINGTON -- South Korea may consult with the United States about scaling back joint military exercises, such as downsizing the deployment of American strategic assets, if North Korea suspends nuclear and missile activities, an adviser to President Moon Jae-in said Friday.Moon Chung-in, a foreign affairs scholar and special presidential adviser, made the remark during a Wilson Center seminar in Washington, saying President Moon has proposed the idea as part of an incremental solution to the nuclear standoff beginning with a freeze of the weapons programs. Moon Chung-in, special presidential adviser for unification, foreign and security affairs. (Yonhap)\"He proposed two things. One, if North Korea suspends its nuclear and missile activities, then we may consult with the United States to (on) scaling down ROK-US joint exercises and training. I think what he has in mind is we may scale down deployment of American strategic weapons over the Korean Peninsula,\" the adviser said.\"Another one is linking North Korea's denuclearization to creation of a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. It is a much more complicated one. It could be much more complicated than the Iranian deal, but anyhow, he laid out those two guidelines to which he would pursue the denuclearization of North Korea,\" he said.The adviser later told reporters that US strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, began participating in joint exercises only since several years ago, and scaling back their participation could help reduce tensions with the North.Chances are low for the North to accept the proposal, but it's still worth a try, he said.\"What's important is to reduce tensions,\" he said.President Moon's idea is to seek an \"incremental, comprehensive, and fundamental solution\" to North Korean problem as he believes \"ultimate denuclearization of North Korea will take much longer period, longer time, most likely not during his tenure if he understands the realistic constraints,\" the adviser said.The offer to downsize joint exercises could be attractive to North Korea as Pyongyang has long denounced such maneuvers as a rehearsal to invade the country and demanded an immediate halt to them. It is unclear, however, how the US would react to the idea because Washington has flatly rejected the North's demand, saying such drills are purely defensive. But the adviser said he believes the US would see little problem with downsizing strategic assets deployment.The adviser also said that the environmental assessment that South Korea plans to conduct over the US THAAD missile defense system could take one year because the study should take into consideration the deployment's impact over four seasons.Earlier this month, South Korea suspended the deployment of an additional four THAAD launchers pending an environmental assessment, spurring doubts the halt might be a precursor to the South ultimately rejecting the THAAD deployment altogether. But Seoul has promised that the environmental review won't lead to a reversal on the deployment itself.Adviser Moon said that it's wrong to say the alliance could break up over THAAD.\"THAAD is a weapons system, defensive weapons system. Does the alliance break up because of that?\" he said. \"It's hard to accept to say as if THAAD is everything about the alliance,\" he said.Adviser Moon, an honorary professor at Seoul's Yonsei University, arrived in Washington earlier this week on a mission to improve understanding among American opinion leaders of the new government's foreign affairs and inter-Korean policy ahead of the summit between the two countries.North Korea is expected be one of the top issues for Moon's June 29-30 meetings with US President Donald Trump, with a focus on how to reconcile Trump's policy of \"maximum pressure\" on the North with Moon's hopes to foster peace through exchanges and cooperation with the isolated neighbor.The adviser said that President Moon plans to seek greater exchanges and cooperation with North Korea within the framework of international sanctions on Pyongyang, a remark seen as aimed at dispelling US concerns that a softer approach by the South's new liberal leader could end up blunting sanctions on Pyongyang.The South seeks a peaceful coexistence or \"de-facto unification\" with the North through trust-building and exchanges and cooperation and won't seek to absorb the North, the adviser said. The new government will also not tolerate the North's provocations, he said.The South should seek dialogue with the North if the North refrains from provocations, the adviser said.\"Is there any reason for us not to have a dialogue when North Korea refrains from provocations?\" he said. \"The point is to improve inter-Korean relations. It's pretty clear that if the inter-Korean relations improved, it would have a positive effect on the missile and nuclear issues.\"The Moon administration also hopes to further strengthen the alliance with the US and take back the wartime operational control of the country's forces from the US in order to reduce its dependence on the US for its security and to enhance its defense capabilities, the adviser said.But he said the OPCON issue is not expected to be a topic for the upcoming summit.

(Yonhap)The apology came 581 days after Baek was knocked unconscious by a blast from a police water cannon and a day after Seoul National University Hospital -- where Baek spent 10 months in a coma before his death -- made a rare correction in his death certificate to change his cause of death from illness to \u201can external cause.\u201dKim Yon-su, vice president of SNUH, told reporters Thursday that Baek\u2019s death was caused by a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a direct blast from a water cannon, a correction made following a monthslong discussion by the hospital\u2019s ethics commission. Doctors had initially stated that his death was due to kidney failure, sparking backlash from Baek\u2019s family and civic groups. Critics have long argued that the doctors, possibly under undue pressure, betrayed their professional conscience so the authorities would not appear responsible for Baek\u2019s death.

Kim Boo-kyum (Yonhap) Do Jong-hwan (Yonhap)Kim Young-choon, also a ruling party lawmaker, was appointed the minister of oceans and fisheries in a ceremony held at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.The appointments came two days after they underwent parliamentary confirmation hearings.With the three new ministers, the number of new Cabinet members appointed under the new Moon Jae-in administration has now come to five. They include Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon, who doubles as the deputy prime minister for economy.The president has 14 more Cabinet members to appoint before what will truly be his first new Cabinet can set sail.Moon has named 11 other nominees for new ministers, but the opposition-led parliament refuses to endorse Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kyung-wha over her past wrongdoings that include the false registration of her address.\u00a0 Kim Young-choon (Yonhap)Transportation Minister nominee Kim Hyun-mee, another incumbent lawmaker from the ruling party, has undergone her confirmation hearing, but the parliamentary hearing committee has failed to issue a report on the outcome of the hearing. The committee is expected to again hold a meeting Monday to discuss its endorsement of Kim.Confirmation hearings for the remaining nine minister nominees are set to be held over the coming weeks.Unlike the prime minister and chief justices of the top courts, new ministers do not require parliamentary approval for their appointments.Still, an appointment of a new minister without the parliament\u2019s endorsement may quickly lead to a strain in relations between Cheong Wa Dae and the opposition-led parliament.President Moon earlier appointed the new head of the Fair Trade Commission, Kim Sang-jo, who had failed to win the parliament\u2019s endorsement.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, controlling 107 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly, nearly single-handedly paralyzed the ongoing parliamentary session through a one-day boycott.The ruling Democratic Party controls 120 seats in the unicameral parliament, the largest number of seats held by any single party, but still falls short of a house majority.The main opposition party has threatened to walk out of the parliamentary session for good if the president appoints his pick for the new foreign minister despite its repeated opposition.Moon has asked the parliament to again try and issue a report on Kang\u2019s confirmation hearing held last week, but noted he may appoint her without the parliament\u2019s endorsement should it fail to do so. (Yonhap)","588":"South Korea and China have made big strides in ties over the past 25 years. The Cold War foes have become \"strategic cooperative partners.\" Trade has surged more than 30-fold with human exchanges up nearly 70-fold. Each is among the other's most favorite tourism destinations. \u00a0However, the quarter-century anniversary of diplomatic ties is in no celebratory mood, as geopolitics are returning with vengeance amid tensions over North Korea's nuclear arms and the deployment of a US missile shield in South Korea.\u00a0 The two countries established formal diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992, leaving behind their animosity stemming from the 1950-53 Korean War and the decades-long Cold War. Communist China fought for the North during the conflict.\u00a0 (Yonhap)Despite many ups and downs, the two countries have never stopped going forward and trending stronger as ties have been widened and deepened, especially in economy and business.According to government data, bilateral trade between South Korea and China, which stood at around $6.4 billion in 1992, surged to $211.39 billion in 2016. China has emerged as the largest export destination for South Korea, which sells more than 20 percent of its products to the world's most populous country.Long closed to each other, the tourism market and personnel exchanges have also been boosted thanks to thawed relations. The data provided by the Korea Tourism Organization showed that just about 152,000 people traveled back and forth between the countries in 1993 but the number increased by 69-fold to some 10,428,000 in 2015. Buoyed by the expanded personal exchanges, around 1,170 flights are now available between the two countries every week.The economic ties culminated in December 2015 when the two enforced a free trade agreement intended to phase out tariffs on more than 90 percent of products over a maximum of 20 years. \"It was a win-win to build diplomatic relations,\" said Yun Duk-min, former chancellor of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. \"South Korea has had significant economic benefits, while at the same time Korea served as a bridge for China to come out of the isolation caused by the Tiananmen Square incident. The Korean economy also provided a major model for China.\" (Yonhap)Jin Jingyi, a professor at Peking University, echoed the view. \"The biggest driving force behind the bilateral ties between China and South Korea was economic exchanges,\" he said. \"In terms of their ties, (the two) have made huge achievements in a very short period of time.\"Their diplomatic ties have also been strengthened ever since. In 2008, they upgraded their relations to a strategic cooperative partnership intended to make exchanges go beyond the economy to cooperation in many other areas including security. The ties got a boost especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2013. Xi paid a visit to South Korea in July 2014, a rare trip by a Chinese leader that preceded a trip to its ally North Korea. About a year later, then South Korean President Park Geun-hye went to Beijing and joined a massive military parade, the centerpiece of the 70th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II.This is not to say that the two have never experienced hiccups in ties.A trade dispute in 2000 sparked by South Korea's safeguard action on Chinese garlic to protect its market which was followed by China banning imports of Korean mobile phones and polyethylene products was one of the lowest points. China's push to include an ancient Korean kingdom in its own history still remains a sensitive issue.With Seoul and China set to mark the 25th anniversary of building diplomatic relations next week, however, their ties seem to be put to the test again as the two remain staunchly at odds over the ongoing installation of a US missile defense system in South Korean territory.In July last year, South Korea and the US unveiled their joint plan to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, saying that it is intended to better defend against missiles from North Korea.China has adamantly opposed the move, claiming it is part of the US missile defense system and its powerful X-band radar, in particular, will hurt its strategic security interests. It has intensified what is seen as retaliation against South Korean companies and products in its markets. China has apparently imposed restrictions on travel to Korea and strictly enforced rules on Korean goods including cultural products.Strained ties with China poses a serious threat for South Korea in terms of the economy due to its heavy dependence on the world's largest market. It might be the last thing that South Korea wants at a time when it seeks cooperation from China, the closest ally to North Korea, to resolve the current nuclear stalemate surrounding the Korean Peninsula.\"Unlike the disputes over garlic or history, the conflict surrounding the THAAD system is a multilateral issue along which the US and China are sharply conflicting with each other. It will not likely be solved just with time,\" said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.Chinese officials also expressed concerns over the prolonged dispute over the THAAD system and its ramifications on ties with South Korea. \"The THAAD issue is the most difficult challenge confronting us over the 25 years,\" Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Qiu Guohong said at a forum held in the southern resort island of Jeju on Thursday. \"Many experts on Korea and China are concerned about the current situation.\"He, however, expressed hope that things would return to normal as the two countries have strong \"momentum\" and \"basis\" for cooperation. \"What I would like to emphasize is that the two countries have made practical cooperation in diverse areas for the past 25 years and that it has created practical benefits for their people,\" he said. \"It has become a trend that cannot be reversed that South Korea and China will advance their ties in a stable and healthy way and it is what everyone wants.\"A senior South Korean diplomat called the recent development caused by the THAAD controversy a \"growing pain,\" saying that it is something that the two countries should overcome to prepare for a better future.\"It is like a growing pain for the relations set to mark the 25th anniversary. We should get over the pain no matter what and try to usher in another 25 years of stronger and healthier ties,\" the diplomat said.

Moon Hee-sang, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party, returns home through Seoul's Gimpo airport on May 20, 2017, after traveling to Tokyo as President Moon Jae-in's special envoy to Japan. (Yonhap)He suggested that Seoul and Tokyo issue a joint declaration aimed at settling the issue just like then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi issued a joint declaration on a future-oriented relationship in 1998. The joint statement, known as \"the Obuchi Declaration,\" included the expression of Japan's remorseful repentance and heartfelt apology for having inflicted unbearable damage and pain on the Korean people.\"The comfort women issue is a universal value of mankind and whatever agreement between the governments are signed, there is no meaning if they are done without the victims' consent,\" Moon said. \"The two countries will mark the 20th anniversary of the Obuchi Declaration's issuance soon, and the leaders of the two countries could issue (another joint declaration) around the anniversary.\"The lawmaker said Seoul and Tokyo are to build future-oriented relations in security, economy, culture and other areas, adding they \"should walk up the third path or the adoption of a two-track approach, differentiating history-related issues and future-oriented ones.\"The two countries signed an agreement in 2015 to settle the long-standing dispute over Japan's sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Korean women during World War II.As part of the deal, Japan agreed to provide 10 billion yen (US$9 million), not in compensation but in support funds, for the Korean women forced into sexual slavery. Moon's stance on the deal is compared with that of the ruling party's leadership, including party chief Choo Mi-ae.

It features three-term lawmakers Kim Young-woo and Lee Hye-hoon, two-term Rep. Ha Tae-kyeung, and first-term legislators Jeong Woon-chun and Ji Sang-wuk.The party was formed in January after its members defected from the then Saenuri Party, a precursor to the LKP amid a factional rift between them and those loyal to the ousted former president.After six rounds of policy debates that begin Saturday, the party will pick its new chief based on a vote by party members and an opinion poll that are weighted 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

(Yonhap)During the meeting, North Korean diplomats agreed to allow Swedish diplomats in the North, who serve as the protecting power for American citizens, to visit US detainees, including Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old University of Virginia student held since January last year, the report said.After the North allowed Swedish officials to visit only one of the four American detainees, the US pressed hard for access to the others and the North requested an urgent meeting with Yun in New York and informed him that Warmbier had fallen into a coma due to food poisoning, according to the report.Following the meeting, Yun and two American physicians flew to Pyongyang on a US plane Monday under orders from President Donald Trump to demand to \"see Warmbier immediately, and, 'if he was in bad shape, to demand his immediate release,'\" the report cited an unidentified official as saying.While in Pyongyang, Yun also visited the three other American detainees, the report said.The Oslo meeting is believed to be the first time officials of the two countries have met face-to-face in a long time. It came as tensions are running high between the two countries with the North carrying out a series of ballistic missile tests and the US working hard to drive up pressure on Pyongyang.The secret meetings might lead to resumption of broader talks between the two sides.

Speaking to lawmakers at the National Assembly, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said the device, discovered last week by the South\u2019s military, could carry biological weapons, warning against the possibility of a terrorist attack using drones. The remarks came a day after the South Korean military announced the discovery of about 10 photos of a battery for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the device\u2019s camera memory.An image of suspected North Korean drone found on a mountain in Inje, Gangwon Province, on Friday. (Yonhap)\u201cI am certain that it was North Korea,\u201d said Han. \u201cI think there is sufficient reason (for the North to acquire the THAAD target through the drone). The drone appears to have engaged in figuring out the location and deployment of the THAAD battery.\u201dHan added, \u201cAs media reports suggested, the drone could inflict harm by mounting biological weapons and a shooting system.\u201d Describing the North Korean\u2019s suspected drone activity as a \u201cgrave\u201d violation of the armistice agreement between the two Koreas, the minister pledged the government would file a complaint against the North through the United Nations\u2019 Command in Seoul. The minister acknowledged that North Korea appears to have made advancements in drone technology with an expanded flight distance and a bigger fuselage, but stressed the drone was not developed enough to send images back to North Korea in real time. His remarks came amid mounting concerns over North Korea\u2019s use of drones for military activities. Although the South Korean military said the drone was designed for \u201csurveillance,\u201d analysts warned the North could turn the device into tools for terrorism. \u201cThe military\u2019s response is a typical example of complacency,\u201d said Shin In-gyun, president of the nonprofit Korea Defense Network. \u201cDrones could be developed into models that can carry toxic gas and anthrax. I don\u2019t have to describe what would happen if the drone sprays toxic substances above Seoul.\u201dThe drone\u2019s payload has yet to be confirmed by the military, but Shin noted that as the device appeared to be an advanced version of a previous model, it could have carried up to 5 kilograms -- capable of delivering toxic materials to the South. According to Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the drone found last week used an advanced twin engine and was bigger than one the military recovered in 2014. Classified as a single-engine drone, the model was able to carry only 400 to 900 grams, capable of carrying a single grenade, the JCS analyzed. Citing a former North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea, the Washington Times reported in May that Pyongyang\u2019s military has 300 to 400 attack drones capable of carrying biological and chemical weapons that could reach Seoul \u201cwithin one hour.\u201dAnalysts acknowledged that there are challenges in detecting and intercepting small drones with current surveillance and air defense assets, but stressed that the military has done little to address what they described an \u201cimminent threat.\u201d After a North Korean drone was found to have flown over the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae and taken pictures of it in 2014, the South Korean military announced plans to ramp up efforts to purchase and develop low-altitude radars targeting drones. The Army decided to acquire 10 RPS-42 radars from Israel, but has yet to complete the purchase. It also began development of an indigenous radar system, but the deployment is expected to take place at least two years from now. \u201cThe North Korean drone threat is an imminent one,\u201d said Shin. \u201cThe military doesn\u2019t need to stick to the idea of purchasing radars from a specific country or developing its own indigenous model. It\u2019s time to put all the options on the table.\u201d Some analyst cautioned the measure would result in massive wastes of taxpayers\u2019 money for extravagant defense spending, criticizing it as the military\u2019s attempt to avoid public embarrassment. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t constrain ourselves when responding to the North Korean drone,\u201d said Chun Young-woo, former presidential secretary for foreign affairs and security. \u201cIt is rather South Korea who has more demand for drones. We should use more drones to detect and strike North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear threats.

The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, centrist People\u2018s Party and splinter conservative Bareun Party, however, remain firmly against the former diplomat, and have called for the president to withdraw the nomination and for Kang to voluntarily resign.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)","609":"Three major parties agreed Monday to deliberate on a 11.2 trillion won ($9.9 billion) extra budget bill, aimed at creating jobs for youth, party officials said, amid a lingering controversy over its legality.The agreement came during a meeting involving National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and the floor leaders of the ruling Democratic Party, and the minor opposition People's Party and Bareun Party. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party did not join the meeting.

(Yonhap)Opposition parties, led by the LKP, initially opposed the bill, saying that it does not meet legal requirements for the supplementary bill.The National Finance Act stipulates that an extra budget can be drawn up in such cases as war or massive natural disasters, economic recession, mass unemployment and crucial changes in cross-border relations.The government and ruling party, however, see the current situation as a case of mass unemployment. The country's jobless rate hit a seven-year high of 5 percent in February and reached 4.2 percent in April, the highest ever rate for the month. In particular, the youth unemployment rate soared to an all-time high of 12.3 percent in February and stayed above the 11-percent range until April.

(Cheong Wa Dae)In the same poll, 14.7 percent disapproved of Moon's job performance, up 0.5 percentage point, while 6.4 percent said they were not sure.The pollster said that the uptick in his rating appears to be attributed to his supporters joining forces to back him during parliamentary confirmation hearings last week for his nominees for the foreign and finance ministers, and the Constitutional Court president.The survey was conducted on 2,022 eligible voters across the country. Its margin of error was plus or minus 2.2 percentage points with a 95 percent confidence level.The poll put support for the ruling Democratic Party at 54.2 percent, down 1.4 percentage points from the previous week, while the rating for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party grew 1.3 percentage points to 14.3 percent.The center-left People's Party garnered 7.3 percent, down 0.7 percentage point. The Justice Party and Bareun Party scored 6.7 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively. (Yonhap)","611":"WASHINGTON -- North Korea could carry out a missile test every 2.1 weeks if the communist regime continues with such banned launches at the same pace it has done so far this year, a US expert said.Troy Stangarone, senior director for congressional affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America, came up with the statistical estimate after analyzing the number of North Korean missile launches since 2012 following North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's rise to power.(Yonhap)\"Since assuming leadership in North Korea, Kim Jong-un averaged 10.8 missile tests per year in the 2012-2016 period. Though, these numbers are driven up by the higher volume of tests in recent years,\" he said in an article posted on the KEI's The Peninsula website.In 2012 and 2013, North Korea conducted a total of eight missile tests, the expert said. If those initial years are excluded and only the more recent period where the rate of testing has increased are examined, the average is 15.3 tests per year in the 2014-2016 period, he said.Since South Korea's new President Moon Jae-in took office last month, the North has conducted five missile tests, but the rate is not unprecedented, the expert said, noting that Pyongyang carried out seven tests, for example, in a four-week time period in 2014.The average number of North Korean missile tests per month was 0.25 in 2012, 0.42 in 2013, 1.3 in 2014, 0.83 in 2015, 1.7 in 2016 and 1.8 in 2017, the expert said.\"If North Korean tests continue at the same pace as they have so far this year, we should expect a new missile test every 2.1 weeks and another 13-14 tests. If that is the case, which it may not be, North Korea would exceed last year's total number of missile tests by 3-4 tests,\" Stangarone said.\"The international community should be prepared to more quickly respond to the advancing pace of North Korea's missile tests by preparing a menu of tightening multilateral sanctions options that have been informally agreed to in advance,\" he said. (Yonhap)","612":"Building a nuclear warhead and a re-entry vehicle durable enough to withstand the extreme heat during a missile's re-entry into the atmosphere is the last-remaining major question North Korea faces in developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile, a US expert said.Jeffrey Lewis, a top expert on North Korean missiles, also said in an article in the Foreign Affairs magazine that the North's Hwasong-12 missile, test-fired last month, showed that its warhead experienced heat loads similar to those of an ICBM and survived. (Yonhap)Mastering warhead miniaturization, as well as re-entry technologies, have long been considered two major challenges Pyongyang must overcome if it wants to develop a nuclear ICBM capable of striking the continental US.Lewis said the North appears to have overcome the miniaturization problem.\"North Korea almost certainly has a compact fission warhead capable of fitting on a future ICBM,\" he said in the article, adding that with five nuclear tests, the North's claim of mastering miniaturization is in line with the progress that other nuclear powers had made at similar points in the development of their programs.\"The major question now is not whether the warhead is small enough to mount on an ICBM but whether it is rugged enough to survive the shock, vibration and extreme temperatures that a nuclear warhead would experience on an intercontinental trajectory, in which it would be shot into space and then re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" he said.The expert also said that a successful intercontinental launch would involve not only the durability of the warhead itself but that of the re-entry vehicle -- the part of the ICBM that protects the warhead from the incredible heat generated by re-entering the atmosphere. \"The warhead fitted to the Hwasong-12 experienced heat loads similar to those of an ICBM (although for a shorter period of time) and survived. Separately, North Korea has published images of an apparently successful ground test of a re-entry vehicle last year,\" he said.Lewis also warned against downplaying the North's capabilities.\"Similar doubts were expressed about China's nuclear warheads in the 1960s, prompting China's leaders to arm a missile with a live nuclear weapon and launch it across the country to dispel any lingering doubts. Fortunately, North Korea has not chosen to take such a step,\" he said. (Yonhap)","613":"The government said Sunday it will ban the trade of live birds for two weeks starting midnight Sunday to prevent the further spread of bird flu.The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs announced the ban as the highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread to 21 farms in 10 days. In this photo provided by the South Gyeongsang provincial government, a quarantine official restricts access to a farm suspected of having chickens infected with avian influenza in Goseong, 466 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on June 11, 2017. (Yonhap)The measure is an extension of a ban the government placed last week on the trade of birds at traditional markets and restaurants that raise their own chickens and ducks.The ministry said it will also ban the transportation of live birds nationwide, rather than only in areas affected by the disease.Under the new measures, vendors who wish to transport or trade live birds will be required to pass clinical tests by quarantine authorities.The latest outbreak is thought to have begun at a farm in Gunsan, 274 kilometers south of Seoul, and spread nationwide mainly through small farms.At a government meeting earlier in the day, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon instructed officials to take all preventive measures as the\u00a0 epidemic could spread over the long term.\"The fact that new cases of AI are appearing through the trade of birds by intermediary vendors and not just through birds that were bought directly in Gunsan means that the current quarantine system is incomplete,\" he said.

Moon Hee-sang, who had also delivered Moon's personal letter to the Japanese leader.Whether Nikai was carrying any message from Abe was not known, but Moon and Abe have agreed to hold a summit in the near future.The two are set to encounter each other at the upcoming Group of 20 summit to be held in Germany's Hamburg on July 7-8, but they are widely expected to hold a separate, bilateral summit.Their meeting, when held, may mark the resumption of what is often referred to as \"shuttle diplomacy\" between the two Asian neighbors that have stalled over the past four years due to a spate of thorny issues that include Japan's territorial claim to South Korea's islets of Dokdo, as well as what is viewed here as a Japanese attempt to whitewash its wartime crimes.The two countries signed an agreement in 2015 to settle the long-standing dispute over Japan's sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Korean women during World War II.As part of the deal, Japan agreed to provide 10 billion yen(US$9 million), not in compensation but in support funds, for the Korean women forced into sexual slavery. President Moon has been critical of the agreement, which was signed by the former conservative administration under ousted leader Park Geun-hye. Moon has said most South Koreans cannot accept the deal, apparently citing a need to renegotiate or even scrap the agreement with Japan.Despite the ongoing dispute over the controversial agreement, both Moon and Abe have stressed a need for their countries to work together to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons.","616":"North Korea\u2019s latest launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile appeared to be a failure, a Seoul-based missile expert claimed Thursday, suggesting that the Hwasong-14 was not equipped with a stable re-entry system that would allow it to survive the heat-intensive process of re-entering the atmosphere.Lee Sang-min, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said there are \u201cthree pieces of scientific evidence\u201d that show the Hwasong-14 test-fired on July 28 lacked the capabilities to enable the warhead to remain intact during re-entry and wreak havoc on the ground One piece of evidence is that when the missile descended back to Earth from outer space, it did not generate a plasma stream, which should have happened if the projectile had made a successful re-entry, Lee said in his report. \u201cI don\u2019t see any trace of (plasma) in the Hwasong-14 launch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is highly likely that the missile\u2019s nose cone did not face extreme heat -- or did not ablate uniformly,\u201d he said, adding that the missile could drift off a target if its nose cone is not ablated properly.\u00a0 Hwasong-14. YonhapAccording to the expert, a straight line of plasma was witnessed in the atmosphere in previous ICBM tests conducted by the US and Russia during the Cold War. It happened regardless of whether it was day or night, he added. Secondly, the missile failed to show a constant flame before splashing down in waters near the Japanese island of Hokkaido, he said, indicating that the projectile\u2019s warhead could have exploded midair during the re-entry phase. Citing an image captured by the Japanese broadcaster NHK, the researcher said if the re-entry vehicle had survived the extreme condition of re-entry, it would have continued to glow until disappearing behind the mountains of Hokkaido. \u201cThe form of flame coming out of the Hwasong-14 looks weird,\u201d said Lee. \u201cConsidering the fact that the missile\u2019s flame suddenly disappeared and there were no further explosions, I suspect that the warhead could have exploded abnormally.\u201dThe last piece of evidence was that the Hwasong-14 appeared to have exploded at an altitude that was deemed too high to wreak havoc on the ground -- even if the missile was outfitted with a nuclear warhead, Lee added. According to the image captured by the NHK, the missile\u2019s re-entry vehicle dimmed and quickly disappeared about 3 to 4 kilometers above ground. At this height, even a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead would bring little damage on the ground, Lee claimed.\u00a0 \u201cNorth Korea was so ambitious about delivering its weapon to the US continent and convincing the international community to believe it had such capabilities.

The Korea Scout Association has been actively pursuing the 2023 event in order to mark 100 years since its establishment in 1922. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also attended the Baku conference to join the campaign and meet with key scout officials there. The Saemangeum area spans 40,200 hectares and is home to the world\u2019s longest man-made seawall at 33.9 kilometers. The seawall was completed in 2010 to attract businesses mostly in the agriculture and renewable energy industry. It was also certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest man-made sea barrier in the world, in the year of its completion. On the other hand, it has also financially burdened the South Korean government for decades, as both environmental and political issues slowed the construction process. A total of 7.3 trillion won is believed to have been invested in the project so far. The Moon administration has been ramping up efforts to invigorate Saemangeum by building roads connecting the area to other key cities. The first phase of the two-tier construction project is slated to be finished by 2022. The 2023 jamboree coincides with the WOSM\u2019s goal to enter China and expand its membership to 100 million. South Korea hosted the World Scout Jamboree in 1991 in Goseong, Gangwon Province. The event is believed to have contributed to the local community through cultural development and road expansion, with 19,000 scout members from 135 nations participating. The World Scout Jamboree was first organized by The Boy Scout Association in London in 1920. The event is attended by scouts aged between 14 and 17.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)","626":"In his first 30 days in office, President Moon Jae-in apparently confirmed the people's willingness and desire for a change as seen in their support for what many of his critics have called the sensational or even radical changes he has initiated.However, his first month in office may have also forced him to recognize certain limitations, partly created by the opposition-led parliament.The new president came into office on May 10, one day after the country held a rare presidential by-election caused by the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye. President Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)Because the election was held to fill the top elected office vacated by the former conservative leader, ousted on March 10, the new president was inaugurated immediately following his victory, with no time whatsoever for a power transition.Unlike most of his predecessors who had their administrations formed and ready to be launched before their inauguration, Moon had to name his prime minister and other Cabinet members after he came into office.So far, he has nominated only seven new Cabinet members out of 19 total.Also, out of the seven nominated, he has only been able to appoint one -- Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon -- with two minister-nominees going through parliamentary confirmation hearings just this week. The other four are scheduled to undergo confirmation hearings next week.Nominations for the 12 other Cabinet members are expected to take more time still, largely for verification amid strong objections from opposition parties against some of the nominees already fielded.Thus the launch of what will truly be President Moon's new administration will have to wait at least for a few more weeks, if not months.The ruling Democratic Party currently controls 120 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly, the largest number for any single political party but still far short of a house majority to provide the type of support the president needs, especially in his first year, to implement the changes he promised while campaigning for office.Still, for many sensational, or even dramatic, changes the president has initiated so far, whether or not the opposition parties approved mattered little amid the strong public support seen in the record figures of Moon's approval rating.President Moon failed to win a majority of votes in the May 9 presidential election, though he did win the election by a record vote gap in the country's history.He won a little over 13.42 million votes, accounting for 41.08 percent of the total cast and a 5.57 million vote lead over runner-up Hong Joon-pyo of the now main opposition Liberty Korea Party.His behavior since the election has often been described as \"humble\" and \"down to earth,\" apparently winning the hearts of many who may have supported other candidates in the election.In the first week following his inauguration, 74.8 percent of 1,516 respondents surveyed by local pollster Realmeter said they expected the new president to do well.After the president embraced a young woman whose father was killed on the day she was born by military forces cracking down on a democratic movement in Gwangju on May 18, 1980, his approval rating shot up to 87 percent in a survey conducted by a separate pollster, Gallup Korea.In addition to the famous embrace that may have been emotional but against many security protocols, Moon has also offered to apologize to the victims of toxic humidifier sterilizers that passed government tests between 2008 and 2011, resulting in dozens of people killed and many more injured.Such an apology, Moon's aides have said, may be long overdue, but not really owed by Moon or his administration.Following his apparently successful first 30 days in office, the president is now expected to begin directing his attention to foreign relations and North Korean issues.He is set to hold a summit with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump in Washington later this month, marking his first-ever summit meeting as South Korea's head of state.The new president has also vowed efforts to restart the six-nation talks on ending North Korea's nuclear ambition, which have been stalled since late 2008.The talks involve both South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia. (Yonhap)","627":"South Korea's major opposition parties urged the government to allow immediate and complete deployment of the THAAD missile defense system Thursday, one day after the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said the deployment will have to be suspended at least for months.The opposition calls came after North Korea fired a series of what appeared to be surface-to-ship cruise missiles from its east coast earlier in the day. (Yonhap)Seoul's defense ministry said the missiles had a short range of around 200 kilometers, but they marked the fourth rocket launch by the communist state since South Korea's new Moon Jae-in administration came into office last month.\"The government is charging at the THAAD deployment and the Korea-US alliance while taking no measures whatsoever against North Korea's missile launches,\" said Rep. Chung Woo-taik, floor leader and acting chief of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party.On Wednesday, a senior Cheong Wa Dae official said the ongoing THAAD deployment should be suspended until the end of an environmental impact assessment.The official did not say how long the assessment will take but noted a US study before the THAAD deployment in Guam had taken 23 months.The US Forces Korea earlier said two THAAD launchers, along with radars and other crucial components, have been deployed in South Korea, making its missile defense capabilities partially operational.At least four more THAAD launchers are waiting to be deployed, earlier reports have confirmed.\"Failing to install a defense system against North Korean missiles will mean neglecting the country's duty. Delaying the deployment (of THAAD), citing an environmental assessment, while North Korea continues to launch missiles every week cannot be accepted by the people,\" Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the main opposition party said. Lee currently heads the parliamentary intelligence committee.The splinter conservative Bareun Party too noted a need to install the US missile shield at an early date.\"The North has already developed nuclear capabilities that target South Korea and is also developing hydrogen bombs. A need to build a defense system at the earliest date possible only requires common sense as the North has been developing nuclear weapons and missiles for a very long time,\" Rep. Kim Se-yeon, secretary-general of the Bareun Party, said in a meeting with party members.The center-left People's Party stopped short of demanding an immediate deployment of THAAD but noted that Cheong Wa Dae should have handled the THAAD issue differently.\"We wish (the government) would also conduct its digging around the THAAD issue quietly, which by the way does not serve our national interest in any way,\" Rep. Lee Yong-ho, the party's policy chief, told a general meeting of party lawmakers. (Yonhap)","628":"South Korea's Constitution leaves no room for pro-North Korea ideologies, the nominee for Constitutional Court chief said Thursday, amid controversy over his ideological orientation.Kim Yi-su, who was tapped by President Moon Jae-in last month, made the remark during the last session of his two-day confirmation hearing at the National Assembly.Constitutional Court chief nominee Kim Yi-su attends a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on June 8, 2017. (Yonhap)\"The Constitution has a democratic republic as its basis,\" the nominee said. \"It cannot blend with certain values that go against the values (of a democratic republic), such as ideologies that follow North Korea.\"Opposition lawmakers have taken issue with his rejection of a petition to disband the far-left Unified Progressive Party in 2014. The party, which was accused of being pro-North, was still disbanded by a majority opinion of the court's nine-member bench.In explaining his reason for rejecting the petition, Kim, who has served on the bench since 2012, claimed the UPP's Rep. Lee Seok-ki and his associates did not have enough power to control the party. Lee is currently in jail for plotting to overthrow the South Korean government in the event of an inter-Korean war.Kim's appointment requires consent from a majority of lawmakers present during a floor vote that can be set up by a majority of all 299 legislators. The ruling Democratic Party, which holds only 120 parliamentary seats, has defended the nominee, saying he has no \"definitive defect.\"During Wednesday's hearing, Kim apologized over allegations that he was at the forefront of judicial punishments for those who participated in the 1980 pro-democracy movement in Gwangju, 350 kilometers south of Seoul. He also pledged to pursue national cohesion.But his opponents said that it is inappropriate to have him helm the court given that Moon has vowed to enshrine the spirits of the popular movement in the Constitution by amending the basic law.On Friday, rival parties are expected to determine whether to adopt a joint report on the outcome of the hearing. Should the report be issued, the confirmation motion could be put to a vote at a plenary session slated for next Monday. (Yonhap)","629":"WASHINGTON -- The US Missile Defense Agency chief expressed serious concern Wednesday about the progress North Korea has made in its missile development, saying the US should assume Pyongyang can strike the US with a nuclear missile.\"I would not say we're comfortably ahead of the threat. I would say we're addressing the threat that we know today. And the advancements in the last six months have caused great concern to me and others,\" Vice Adm. James Syring told a House Armed Services Committee hearing. (Yonhap)\"It is incumbent upon us to assume that North Korea today can range the United States with an ICBM carrying a nuclear warhead. Everything that we're doing plans for that contingency and in addition to looking ahead to what might be developed, what is possible over the next five to 10 years,\" he said.Syring also said that the North has been \"not only testing at an alarming rate in violation of international law but demonstrating technology that feeds development of longer-range missiles and more capable missiles as well.\" (Yonhap)","630":"Daily kimchi consumption can help reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis -- a common skin disease characterized by rashes -- a new study suggested Sunday.photo credit: 123rfResearchers at Seoul\u2019s Kyung Hee University found from a 2010-2012 national nutritional health survey conducted on 7,222 adults nationwide that those who consumed a daily diet including 85-158 grams of kimchi -- or two to three servings a day -- developed an average of 32 percent fewer atopic dermatitis outbreaks compared to those who consumed less. A traditional side dish made from salted and fermented cucumbers, radishes or pickled cabbage, kimchi can be found alongside nearly any Korean meal.The result came after the researchers took into consideration drinking, smoking habits and other external factors of the surveyed people, the research team said.

The government must devise fundamental measures,\u201d Rep. Lee Kai-ho, a member of President Moon Jae-in\u2018s de facto transition team, said during a briefing by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The ministry said it would look further into the sudden outbreak of the H5N8 virus strain, believed to be less likely in the warm season so far, while continuing carry out culls to curb its spread.Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-woo holds a video conference from his office in Sejong, south of Seoul, on June 7, 2017, with provincial chiefs to discuss joint efforts to contain avian influenza. The bird flu alert was raised to the highest level after the virus was found to be of a highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 that has high death rates. (Yonhap)All transportation of live poultry was halted for 24 hours on Wednesday, while small-scale farms with less than 100 livestock were recommended to carry out a cull. Approximately 176,100 chickens and ducks on 66 different farms had been slaughtered as of Wednesday, with the number expected to rise. The first report of the outbreak came Friday, from an owner of a small backyard chicken farm on the southern island of Jeju after his birds died from the disease. All domesticated birds living within 500 meters of the Jeju farm were culled within 24 hours of the first report, and shipments of poultry on and off the island were immediately halted. Amid the ongoing investigation, authorities suspect some infected farms of deliberately delaying reports of the disease and vowed an in-depth investigation into the matter. Min Yeon-tae, head of the Agriculture Ministry\u2019s livestock policy bureau said in a press briefing Wednesday that this year\u2019s sudden outbreak is believed to be largely due to a group of farmers\u2019 efforts to conceal the outbreak. \u201cThe nature of these poultry farms are more like distributors, which is why we suspect the possibility of delayed reports out of fear of financial loss,\u201d said Min. The ministry unveiled plans to strengthen punishments for farm owners who delay reports related to livestock diseases or deliberately ignore signs of an outbreak. The current law allows them to be sentenced to up to one year in jail or a fine of 10 million won ($8,900), but the revised law aims to increase these maximums to 3 years in jail or a 30 million won fine. Concerns over a lack of relevant agricultural knowledge among small-scale farm owners have also been raised. Unauthorized \u201chobby farms\u201d on 10-square-meters of land or less, which were not subject to government surveillance are now obligated to register with the government. A special quarantine unit will be formed to inspect the trade of poultry and sanitation of bird houses. Close watch over the illegal slaughtering of birds in traditional markets will be initiated and more hygienic packaging methods will be suggested to the vendors. According to government reports, outbreak is thought to have started in a group of birds at a farm in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, which were later shipped to areas including Paju, Gyeonggi Province, and Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province. The Agriculture Ministry suspects the signs showed up in early May based on a retrospective analysis. The outbreak this year follows one of the worst-ever bird flu outbreaks last year, which resulted in the demise of a fifth of the total poultry population here. President Moon Jae-in pledged not to repeat the sluggish reaction shown by the previous government by encouraging authorities to take strong preventive measures and instructing Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon to keep tabs on the issue.By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)","632":"South Korean quarantine officials culled nearly 700 birds Wednesday on the country's southern resort island of Jeju in the latest attempt to contain the spread of avian influenza.Quarantine workers gassed a total of 695 chickens and ducks from three poultry farms and packed them in plastic bags with carbon dioxide before burying them in fields near the chicken and duck farms, Kim Ik-chan, an official handling the issue at the Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, spoke by phone from Jeju.(Yonhap)The move highlighted South Korea's desperate efforts to try to block the spread of a highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 that hit the resort island on Friday.Separately, quarantine officials have already killed more than 144,000 poultry in Jeju following the latest outbreak of bird flu -- the first in two months in South Korea.The culled birds accounted for about 8 percent of the total 1.67 million chickens and 43,000 ducks on the island.Besides Jeju, quarantine officials have also slaughtered more than 30,700 poultry in several other cities, including Gunsan and Iksan, both located in the country's southwestern region, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.As of Wednesday, five suspected bird flu cases were confirmed to be a highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 while lab tests are underway to identify the AI strains in 13 other suspected cases.On Monday, the officials said the five suspected cases from farms in the southern city of Ulsan and Yangsan were confirmed as the H5N6 strain.Highly pathogenic bird flu refers to viruses that spread quickly and result in high death rates, according to the World Health Organization.South Korea slaughtered more than 30 million poultry to contain the worst outbreak of bird flu that hit the country in November.It was forced to cull 14 million birds in 2014.

In July 2008, it suspended the tour project at the mountain on North Korea's east coast after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort.

(Yonhap)The system has been and currently is subject to a \"small, informal\" environmental assessment afforded by what Seoul's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae has referred to as systematic efforts by the country's defense ministry to make the THAAD battery appear smaller in size and scale.Under an agreement, Seoul is set to provide some 700,000 square meters of land for the deployment of the missile defense system to be operated for and by US Forces Korea but will boost the country's own defense capabilities as well.Under the law, any new installation of equipment or facilities that affect more than 330,000 square meters of land must first be assessed for their environmental impact before being deployed or built.The THAAD system, however, was able to be deployed here as the defense ministry provided only 320,000 square meters of land first, subjecting it only to the ongoing \"small and informal\" evaluation.The remaining 380,000 square meters of land promised under the THAAD agreement is set to be provided later, again exempting the THAAD deployment from a full-blown environmental impact assessment, Cheong Wa Dae said earlier, citing the outcome of its recent probe on the issue.The special probe was initially triggered by suspicions that the defense ministry had omitted the delivery of four THAAD rocket launchers into the country in its report to the president and his de facto power transition team.Cheong Wa Dae said the probe has confirmed an \"intentional omission\" of such facts by a ministry official. He was relieved of his duty after the probe.A new investigation is now under way to find out who had designed the supply of the land for THAAD in such a way that it was successfully kept from a full-blown environmental impact assessment.\"The order to conduct an environmental impact assessment is a guideline to enhance the procedural legitimacy of the deployment, so the defense ministry will review ways to conduct such a study,\" Defense Minister Han Min-koo has said.The problem is that a new full-blown test may take up to a year and also delay or suspend the ongoing deployment of the THAAD system over the period.The THAAD agreement was signed by the former administrations of both South Korea and the US, and the new Donald Trump administration is already showing signs of reservations, with the US president also mentioning a need to renegotiate the terms to have Seoul pay for the US defense system.Cheong Wa Dae maintains the controversy over the THAAD deployment is strictly local and that Washington understands that as well.In a meeting with USFK commander Gen. Vincent Brooks and the visiting director of the US Missile Defense Agency V. Adm. James Syring in Seoul on Monday, Chung Eui-yong, Seoul's top security adviser to the president, again explained that the recently concluded probe on the THAAD deployment and the proposed study on its environmental impact were moves to secure or enhance the legitimacy of the deployment, the presidential office said earlier.Brooks and Syring expressed gratitude for his explanation and said they fully understood the South Korean government's position, it added.

The Seoul Central District Court partially ruled in favor of five English teachers who filed a suit in September 2015 against their former employer, a private language education chain in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province which refused to acknowledge them as regular employees and offer severance pay. The group is made up of three US citizens, one South Korean and one Canadian.(123RF)The verdict ordered the institute to give the plaintiffs a total of 187 million won ($167,000) in severance pay, along with compensation for unused annual leave and vacation.In court, the institute\u2019s attorneys argued the teachers were hired under \u201cservice contracts for instructors,\u201d which provide wages at an hourly rate and consider them privately contracted workers. The contracts did not stipulate basic or fixed pay and a guaranteed registration of social insurance programs, nor require them to pay earned income tax. The team also insisted benefits like pensions were already included in the wage package. But the court dismissed such claims, stating that the terms of the contracts represented an \u201carchetypal\u201d employer-employee relationship. \u201cThe contract terms on codes of conduct regarding termination of contract, probation, and workplace punctuality policies represent the nature of direct employment,\u201d the verdict reads. \u201cThus the contract should be viewed as an official labor contract.\u201dBy Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)","643":"The ruling and opposition parties agreed Monday to push for a resolution calling for the reunions of families separated across the inter-Korean border in time for Aug. 15 Liberation Day, party officials said.The agreement came during a meeting among National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and the floor leaders of the ruling Democratic Party and two minor opposition parties.

(Yonhap)The UNSC passed Resolution 2321 after the isolationist regime detonated its fifth nuclear device in early September. Under the guidelines set by the international community, North Korea can only ship out 7.5 million tons of coal worth $408.7 million this year. All United Nation members states are obliged to report transactions undertaken with the North on a monthly basis.The committee said that in January, the North shipped out 1.44 million tons of coal, with numbers reaching 1.23 million tons and 6,300 tons in February and March, respectively. It said just one country, presumably China, imported coal from the North.North Korea's trade with China made up 90 percent of external transactions, with coal and iron ore making up 40 percent of goods traded between the two neighboring countries.As of April, the North coal shipments already reached 57 percent of its maximum export limit in terms of value for this year.

This provokes nothing but regret.\"Another deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov criticised the move as \"showing a lack of ability to look at things more broadly and a knee-jerk return to a discredited approach\" in comments to TASS state news agency.\"I got a sense of bad deja-vu,\" he added.Thursday's announcement listed Moscow-based Ardis-Bearings LLC and its director, Igor Aleksandrovich Michurin, for business they do with North Korean firm Korea Tangun Trading Corporation. Tangun was already placed under sanctions in 2009 for its involvement in North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, the Treasury said.Another Russian firm, the Independent Petroleum Company, has a contract to sell oil to North Korea and \"may have\" worked to help the country circumvent sanctions, it said.","649":"South Korea is poised to complete the installment of a US missile shield next week, officials said Friday, despite unabated controversy over the Moon Jae-in government\u2019s flip-flopping on the timing of the deployment. The stationing of the remaining four launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system comes as the Environment Ministry wraps up a small-scale environmental review. The equipment will join the already operational two launchers, radar and other assets to form a full-fledged battery. The move will also coincide with a maiden face-to-face meeting between South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo and US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, set for Wednesday in Washington. \u201cCurrently a small-scale environmental impact assessment is under way, and I can\u2019t say it for certain, but the results are likely to come out around Monday,\u201d a Cheong Wa Dae official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. This photo shows a launcher of the US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system at its site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The Ministry of National Defense echoed the view, saying the four launchers and related apparatus will be brought to the site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, as soon as the survey is finished. \u201cThe assessment is now in its final phase and we\u2019re working to meet the Environment Ministry\u2019s requests to supplement the process,\u201d a Defense Ministry official told reporters, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter and referring to tests of electromagnetic waves and fine dust. \u201cThe necessary equipment and materials should be transferred when the EIA ends, so we will set the exact date through consultations with the US and notify the press and local residents (of Seongju) at least one day before the system\u2019s delivery.\u201d The official noted the issue of electromagnetic waves emitted by THAAD, which some lawmakers and activists have argued may be harmful to human health, would not postpone the deployment. The Defense Ministry carried out another electromagnetic waves check at three locations in the nearby city of Gimcheon early this week and found levels to be safe. It tested Seongju on Aug. 12 after a prior attempt crumbled due to the resistance of some residents. But the two officials refused to confirm Thursday\u2019s remarks by the main opposition Liberty Korea Party\u2019s Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, who chairs a parliamentary intelligence committee, that Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon is \u201cbothering his mind\u201d because of the Donald Trump administration\u2019s demand for the four THAAD launchers to be put in place by Wednesday. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office and ruling Democratic Party of Korea called Lee\u2019s comment \u201cgroundless.\u201d The lawmaker on Friday again defended his claim, saying though he does not have any recording to prove it, the PMO would have contacted him to lodge a complaint \u201cif it was a lie.\u201d\u00a0The on-site analysis began about a month ago in line with Moon\u2019s instruction to speed up the THAAD deployment shortly after North Korea test-fired a second intercontinental ballistic missile. The move marked a reversal of the fledgling leadership\u2019s earlier decision to conduct a formal, comprehensive environmental review, which would delay the installment to at least late next year, triggering Washington\u2019s discomfort and the opposition\u2019s criticism at home. Asked whether the THAAD installment would be finalized within this year at a parliamentary session Thursday, Chung Eui-yong, chief of the presidential National Security Office, also said it would be completed \u201cfar earlier than that.\u201d The swift deployment is expected to ease the burden for Song, who has a slew of sensitive items on the agenda other than North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear and missile threats.

The prosecutors from Seoul will arrest her aboard the plane. The 51-year-old is accused of embezzling 49.2 billion won ($43.8 million) from subsidiaries of her father's company, Cheonghaejin Marine Co.According to French authorities, the top administrative court Conseil d'Etat has dismissed Yoo's appeal she filed against the ruling that approved her extradition. She fled to France three years ago when the South Korean prosecution summoned her for questioning soon after the ferry disaster. In May of that year, she was arrested by the French police in Paris but asked to be investigated without detention on grounds that she had a teenage son to look after. She served 13 months in jail, until she was released in June 2015, on condition that she needs to report her whereabouts to the police regularly.

(Yonhap)The North said that it fired the missile at the highest angle and the missile reached the maximum altitude of more than 2,111.5 kilometers before landing in the East Sea 787 km away. Experts said the missile could have flown about 4,500 km if it had been fired at a normal angle. Michael Elleman, senior follow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the missile's engine is very much different from that of the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile that the North was believed to be working on as a step toward ICBM development.\"This, to me, is a big deal,\" Elleman said during a briefing organized by 38 North. \"It's highly unlikely that it was indigenously designed, developed and produced. My working hypothesis at this point, given the performance of the engine, its appearance, it likely is derived from an old Russian engine called the RD-250.\"The expert also said that the North could have sourced it from Ukraine.\"What is important here is it comes from a different manufacturer than all the other engines that we've seen, and missiles we've seen, used in North Korea,\" he said. \"We could be in for surprises in the future. It's very difficult to bound their capabilities and what might occur in the future, because we don't know if they have access to new and improved engines.\"Elleman said that the Hwasong 12 is the \"first step\" towards developing an ICBM capable of striking the US.Asked how close the North is to developing such an ICBM, the expert said that the North would need at least three years to conduct enough tests if they want to have 75 percent confidence in an ICBM.\"So I don't foresee an operationally viable ICBM before 2020, maybe 2021,\" he said. \"For emergency use, they could shorten that timeframe, but at the risk that one or a large fraction of their missile force would fail.\" (Yonhap)","653":"President Moon Jae-in on Thursday held phone talks with Denmark\u2019s prime minister to discuss North Korea\u2019s nuclear issue and ways to strengthen their countries\u2019 ties, the presidential office said.Moon expressed his thanks to Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen for Denmark\u2019s support of Seoul\u2019s move to seek North Korea\u2019s denuclearization, according to Cheong Wa Dae.

Beijing has been adamantly opposed to the move, claiming that it is part of the US missile defense system that will hurt its strategic security interest.The forum is seen as one of just a few joint events between the two countries at a time when the friction over the THAAD system seems to be intensifying.\"I think friends refer to relations in which each understands and respects different views, not to agree on everything.

When Kwon Ji-hyun, a 36-year-old working mom, decided to bear it and relocate to an unheard-of village in west Seoul four years ago, there was only one thing on her mind: a daycare center where her child can be in good hands.\"I was at a loss for what to do when my mother said she had to move out of town. She was of great help in taking care of my son,\" she said, asking for an alias to be used.She couldn't find anyone to help her care for the baby who was just four years old at the time. All child care centers were booked up and she was so desperate.While searching the Internet for days, Kwon stumbled upon a child care center with one opening located in a village called Sungmisan. As soon as she heard that her baby was accepted, she didn't hesitate at all to move. South Korea`s first \"shared\" child care center (Yonhap)The child care center might seem to be no different from others but it is the country's first \"shared\" child care facility where parents are actively engaging in caring for and educating their kids, not to mention its management.In 1994, a few young couples pooled their money and launched this child care center here in a bid to help each other in caring for babies and actively getting involved in ensuring transparency and getting more access to food, education and so on.In pursuit of alternative child care and more involvement in raising their kids, more young couples moved in, naturally turning the neighborhood into what is now commonly known as Sungmisan Village.Building on the initial child care infrastructure, Sungmisan residents -- estimated at around 1,000 in 2015 -- are now jointly running around 70 community activities ranging from a school, cafe, small theater, and food cooperative to small stores tailored to meet their own needs.Through such joint activities, many meet quite often to have drinks over their kids and daily life which brings them closer to the level of first-name friends. An annual festival, group learning classes, and info and news bulletin boards are also making their friendship and community more closely knit. Food cooperative (left) and community cafe (Yonhap)\"Joining in activities at the child care center, I have made many friends, though most of them are older than me. We talk about kids, how to raise and educate them and sometimes share our views on our daily life and jobs,\" Kwon said.\"We have gotten close enough to leave our children with those living next door in times of emergency, which you cannot begin to expect while living in a big city like Seoul,\" she added.Sungmisan Village, named after a small mountain in the region and located in Mapo-gu, west Seoul, has emerged as a rare but vibrant urban community steadily growing and getting attention from people fed up with typical life in a large city like Seoul.Seoul, home to around 10 million people, has turned into a megacity teeming with high-rise apartments and buildings over the past few decades.Long gone in the process are the close-knit communities and friendly neighbors, and even casual greetings with those living just next door have become few and far between. Bulletin boards in which villagers share community news (Yonhap)Sungmisan has been attracting people especially nostalgic about the \"good old days\" where many things were shared among neighbors, including food and worries about their daily life, jobs and family issues. Such nostalgia and longing to return to those days was stirred recently by a popular cable TV drama \"Reply 1988,\" which featured the daily life of friendly neighbors in a cohesive village in the 1980s. Still, child care and education are the top reasons for many opting to settle in Sungmisan Village.Kong Byung-gak in his late 40s was one who came to the village for education. He sent his two children to an alternative school launched in the early 2000s here, which focuses less on textbooks and rote learning and more on hands-on and ecological experiences. \"It was like an escape from education that makes our kids unhappy. I couldn't have my kids get education solely focused on college entrances,\" Kong said.He now leads a de facto community operation council where major decisions in the village are discussed and made. He recently opened a beer shop that serves as a meeting place for the council and other neighbors. \"This is a place where people get together and chit-chat. Sometimes, a party is held on the spur of the moment. This is fun and we like this small happiness,\" he said. \"You can experience what was featured in such dramas as 'Reply 1988.'\" Sungmisan map (Yonhap)There was a crisis that put the fate of the village in jeopardy.When the Seoul government pushed to build a new water distribution system in the Sungmisan region in the early 2000s, its residents staged a strong protest and campaign against it. The movement went on for about two years and the city project was withdrawn.The worst, however, could be yet to come. One of the potential threats is the steadily rising rent of buildings and houses in the region partly buoyed by brisk development and hot spots springing up in neighboring regions such as Mangwon, Hongdae and Seogyo.\"Ironically, as we are getting more attention, the rent is rising due to hot spots springing up in nearby regions. This is forcing some of our landmark stores out of the market,\" Kong said.\"People say that we can buy happiness with money, but that belief, I think, is destroying human relationships and making them unhappy. I think that enjoying happiness through relationships with people, albeit small, is genuine happiness,\" he noted.

North Korea is not a member.On the sidelines of the session, Han is expected to hold a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with some of his counterparts, such as US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Japan's Tomomi Inada.In talks with Mattis, North Korea's growing missile and nuclear threats will be high on the agenda.It's almost certain that the THAAD issue will be raised as well, as it comes ahead of summit talks between South Korea's new President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart Donald Trump slated for late this month.The US Forces Korea has positioned two THAAD rocket launchers and a cutting-edge X-band radar at the designated site in Seongju, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, under a bilateral deal signed in 2016.Four more launchers remain stored at a nearby US military base to be installed there.Han has come under fire amid allegations that he has sought to conceal the dispatch of the four extra launchers to the country.The presidential office said the defense ministry \"intentionally\" dropped a related explanation from a report to Moon on pending defense issues.The THAAD equipment apparently arrived here before Moon took office on May 9 in a process that the Pentagon says was transparent.But Moon has stated that THAAD was brought into the country without public consent and due procedures. He wants to review Seoul's decision on THAAD or renegotiate it with the Trump administration.

The test is the \"the next step to not only improving reliability but improving performance against the evolving threat,\" Syring said.\"We want to exercise the GMD (Ground-Based Midcourse Defense) system with more than one interceptor to gather data for what a first interceptor would do in terms of kill and what the second interceptor would see,\" he said.

It could send Washington a message that Seoul may not stand by it in a crunch,\" said Lee Sang-hyun, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute in Seoul.\"South Korea has no choice but to take its time and persuade China over the need for the THAAD installment.

It has also closed several stores of Lotte Group, which provided the golf course in return for a military-owned land plot near Seoul.Lee said South Korea should also make an effort to explore leverage against China by diversifying its diplomacy as it has learned the lesson the hard way that Seoul has no tools of its own to counter Beijing's retaliation.During the campaign for the May 9 presidential election, South Korean President Moon Jae-in was critical of the decision to host THAAD, insisting that it was made without due process to collect public opinion. Presidential aides say the stance does not necessarily mean Moon is opposed to the deployment.US President Donald Trump has fueled opposition to THAAD among the South Korean public by demanding the South pay for the $1 billion system. The demand runs counter to a deployment agreement in which the US agreed to pay for the system if the South agreed to host it and provide land.At the forum, Jang Hyung-soo, a professor of Hanyang University in Seoul, predicted that China's rise will likely change the world economic order but Beijing may not outstrip Washington as the world's No. 1 economy at least by 2050.\"Both domestic and foreign media forecast China's economic size to overtake the US by 2030 several years ago, when China's economic growth hovered around 10 percent,\" Jang said. \"Even under the most optimum conditions it will not be until 2035 and 2040 at the earliest that China becomes No. 1 and there is a low possibility of China outstripping the US overwhelmingly.\"As of 2015, America's per capita gross domestic product came to $60,000, while the figure for the world's second-largest economy ranged from $7,000 to $8,000, he said, adding it would take at least 50 years for China's number to match half that of the US.Meanwhile, Cho Nam-hoon, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, predicted China may not be able to overtake the US in military power even after 2050.

Safety guidelines that repair crew should work in pairs and train operation should be halted while they are on tracks were ignored to minimize the convenience of passengers. The victim, surnamed Kim, was all by himself on the tracks, and the train\u2019s conductor was not informed of the ongoing maintenance work. One year later, nine officials at subway operator Seoul Metro and its subcontractor in charge of door maintenance work, the employer of the victim, were prosecuted Monday for failing to observe safety guidelines. However, subway workers still feel they are at risk -- not just on subway railroads, but at shipyards, factories and other risky workplaces. Many workers say money often comes before their safety.A foreigner lays a flower at Guui Station in Seoul on Sunday, marking the one-year anniversary of the death of a 19-year-old mechanic who died while working on a malfunctioning screen door on May 28, 2016. (Yonhap)\u201cA lot of news went on about more surveillance cameras and emergency exits installed around tracks at subway stations after the accident. But those emergency doors that open from the tracks are only installed at a few stations,\u201d said Lim Seon-jae, 34, a contract worker from Seolleung PSD, another subcontracted subway platform maintenance company.After the death, Seoul Metro hired 50 new employees to augment workplace safety. Now, employers must strictly abide by the rules and have to work in pairs. But without a supply of sufficient new workers, it has only increased their workload, the company\u2019s labor union said. Seventeen workers work 15 hours a day, covering over 30 subway stations, it claimed. \u201cUnlike regular employees who work on a double shift rotated by four teams, contract workers only have three teams working a double shift,\u201d a labor union member surnamed Kim told The Korea Herald.\u201cNot many people know that non-regular workers are still demanding improved treatment, because the changes (following the accident last year) were only applied to regular employees.\u201dHe said that at least 40 more workers are needed to guarantee safety. Experts agree that subcontracted employees, who take up high-risk jobs that are outsourced, remain vulnerable to industrial accidents. According to statistics, about 87 percent of all workers who died from industrial accidents last year were working for subcontracted companies. \u201cWhile the current law is insufficient to secure the safety of workers from subcontracted companies from industrial accidents, the entire labor environment will not easily improve,\u201d said Lee Byung-hun, a professor of sociology at Chung-Ang University.\u201cThere should be stronger legal penalties for safety violations in environments such as construction or maintenance sites,\u201d he added.Some civic groups claim that a fundamental fix is possible only when those assuming high-risk tasks are treated equally with regular workers. When outsourced, workers\u2019 safety could be sacrificed for the sake of cost reduction as small companies compete to land a contract. \u201cThe current employment system can only fundamentally changed when more regular jobs are created with equal wage and treatment,\u201d said Lee Nam-shin, director of Manwonhaengdong, a civic movement calling for the minimum wage to be set at 10,000 won ($8.90) and the abolishment of non-regular jobs. \u201cThe only way to prevent deaths like Kim\u2019s is to start off by transferring irregular workers in the public sector to regular status,\u201d he said. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon vowed to prevent subway workers\u2019 accidents. \u201cI admit that all those errors that occurred a year ago from the accident are yet to be completely corrected. I will try and try again to protect the dreams and safety of young workers like Kim.\u201dIn a Facebook post, Sim Sang-jeong of the progressive Justice Party urged the National Assembly to pass a bill to better protect subcontracted workers from workplace accidents.\u201cLast year in June, a revision to the current Industrial Safety and Health Act was submitted to the National Assembly but was discarded after lawmakers failed to endorse it. A year later, I request lawmakers again to carry out their responsibility and make change in irregular workers\u2019 lives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf the current employment system continues as it is, accidents like the Sewol ferry sinking and the death of the young worker at Guui Station will happen again.\u201dBy Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","681":"The South Korean government said Monday six dammed reservoirs set aside for irrigation will remain open from Thursday as part of an effort to prevent water quality from deteriorating further.Six out of 16 dammed pools on the \"four rivers\" built for irrigation will be opened from 2 p.m. in a move to help resolve their serious green algae problems.

As for the remaining 10 dams, the government plans to gradually open them after checking for their possible environmental impact and effects on farming in nearby areas, he said.The 16 dammed reservoirs are on the country's Han, Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan rivers, which underwent a mega-scale restoration project to prevent water shortages, improve water quality and create riverside tourism spots under the Lee Myung-bak administration whose five-year term ended in February 2013.As some of the dammed pools turned completely green with algae after the massive development project, environmentalists have called it a failure and claimed they have caused serious damage to the environment.On May 22, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae ordered an inspection of the four rivers development project. It will be the fourth round of inspections carried on on policies implemented by previous governments. There are two probes underway for policies made under the Lee government and one carried out while impeached President Park Geun-hye was in power.Under the 22 trillion won ($20 billion) project, the Lee government spent 11.9 trillion won, about half of the budget, on works on the Nakdong River, the longest river in Asia's fourth-largest economy.

Reflecting such calls, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party adopted a demand Wednesday for the redeployment of US tactical nuclear arms as its official party line during a general meeting of its lawmakers.\"If we say we're going to have nuclear weapons while putting forward the goal of North Korea's denuclearization, it will end up undermining the justification of our demand for denuclearization and further accelerating nuclear armament in Northeast Asia,\" Lee said in an interview with YTN television.

However, the outlook for reform legislation looks uncertain, and the June plenary session will test the so-called cooperative governance envisioned by the government.The National Assembly holds a plenary session at the parliamentary building in Seoul on March 30, 2017. (Yonhap)One of the more contentious issues is whether deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD system should be put to a vote in the Assembly.While Seoul\u2019s Ministry of National Defense insisted that the deployment is not a matter for parliamentary consent, Moon\u2019s ruling Democratic Party of Korea repeatedly has said that it needs ratification as the previous administration did not build public consensus in making the crucial decision. Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party said he would not stand by and watch the government make the wrong decision.\u201cThe deal has already been made and it is covered under the South Korea-US mutual defense treaty already approved by the National Assembly,\u201d he said.The conservative Liberty Korea Party also stands to oppose the Democratic Party. Opposing factions are also divided over on the new government\u2019s plan to expand the supplementary budget to increase jobs in the public sector. During the electioneering period, Moon had pledged to create 810,000 jobs in public institutes and government organizations, which the opposition parties called \u201cunrealistic and short-sighted.\u201dMoon also said he would like to plan a supplementary budget of 10 trillion won ($9 billion) for the employment scheme. Opposition parties, while agreeing on the need to set a supplementary budget, showed skepticism at the idea of using tax to create more jobs. \u201cThe plan lacks fundamental details of the plan. It would be a waste of taxpayers\u2019 precious money,\u201d Rep. Lee Yong-ho, the chief policy maker of the centrist People\u2019s Party said. \u201cIncreasing tax to create more jobs would be passing the burden to the next generation.\u201dThe splinter Bareun Party also said they would look into the details of the source of the finance. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party maintained that employment should be increased in the private sector.\u201cMaking jobs with extra budget is only a temporary plan. The private sector should take the role of boosting employment and lead the increase of tax revenues,\u201d Rep. Lee Hyun-jae, the Liberty Korea Party\u2019s policy chief said. Another point of dispute is the three-part reform -- restructuring of the prosecution, National Intelligence Service, and the media. While the issue of an overhaul of the nation\u2019s prosecution has been on the negotiation table in previous governments, an agreement was never reached.As the new government seeks to establish a new government body to watch for corruption in public offices, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, which holds 107 seats at the 299-member parliament, showed disapproval. \u201cIt is a unilateral decision made by the government without a thorough review or a clear direction (to create the watchdog body) on such an important issue related to the nation\u2019s fate,\u201d Rep. Bak Maeng-woo, the conservative party\u2019s secretary-general said. The ruling Democratic Party is seeking to win the other parties around through negotiation.\u201cThe National Assembly was often divided when one side pushes too hard to pass a reform bill,\u201d said the party\u2019s spokesperson Rep.

But Beijing has opposed the system, arguing it could be used against it.Meanwhile, the country's air cargo traffic also rose 6.6 percent to 353,063 tons in April from 331,293 tons a year earlier, the statement said.\"An increase in exports of semiconductors and other information-technology products pushed up the monthly cargo traffic,\" it said. (Yonhap)","689":"The Group of Seven member countries on Saturday said North Korea poses an increasing threat to the peace and stability of the international community, according to news reports.\"North Korea, a top priority in the international agenda, increasingly poses new levels of threat of a grave nature to international peace and stability,\" read a communique issued following the two-day G-7 summit held in Taormina, Italy, according to Russia's Itar-Tass news agency. (Yonhap)The leaders also insisted that Pyongyang \"must immediately and fully comply with all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and abandon all nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.\"The joint declaration also called on the international community to \"redouble its efforts to ensure the sustained, comprehensive and thorough implementation of relevant UNSCRs.\"Reuters reported that the G-7 leaders said they were \"ready to strengthen measures against North Korea unless it abandons all nuclear programs.\"The South Korean foreign ministry said it welcomes the joint statement by the G-7 leaders.\"The government welcomes the statement by the leaders as it delivers strong messages demanding the North denuclearize and resolve its human rights and humanitarian problems,\" a senior ministry official said. The United Nations Security Council earlier this month condemned North Korea for its latest ballistic missile test, warning that it will implement further sanctions over its provocative acts.In a statement, adopted unanimously on May 16, the 15-member council urged the communist nation to show \"sincere commitment to denuclearization through concrete action.\" \"To that end, the Security Council demanded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conduct no further nuclear and ballistic missile tests,\" the council said, using the official name for the North. (Yonhap)","690":"President Moon Jae-in's first 100 days in office got mixed scorecards Wednesday as opposition parties denounced his appointment mishaps, policy disputes and cross-border tensions, while the ruling party touted his push for reform and peace.A day before the 100th day since Moon's inauguration, the conservative parties accused the president of unilaterally pushing for the liberal agenda dear to his heart on the back of public support that has been hovering well above 70 percent.The governing Democratic Party countered that Moon has laid the groundwork for restoring democracy and justice that has been rattled by a massive corruption scandal involving former conservative President Park Geun-hye.Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, staged a press conference to highlight its discontent with the young government's handling of state affairs, claiming that it has been \"incompetent, self-righteous and populist.\" Chung Woo-taik (C), the floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, speaks during a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Aug. 16, 2017. (Yonhap)Chung, particularly, took issue with Moon's ongoing reform drive to eliminate the \"accumulated evils\" of past governments, portraying it as \"political retribution\" that has exacerbated ideological division.\"The Moon administration was elected with pledges to remove the accumulated evils, but there seem to be little it has redressed.... Rather, it has accumulated new evils in terms of security, personnel and policy,\" Chung told reporters.\"The removal of accumulated evils has now become synonymous with political retribution, ideological bias and rough-and-ready (policies),\" he added.He also lambasted Moon's contentious personnel appointments and nominations, which led some to quit in the face of searing public and political opprobrium, and his seemingly dovish stance over an increasingly belligerent Pyongyang.\"Moon has pledged to take the driver's seat in handling issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula but aren't we in a situation where we are taking a back seat let alone a passenger's seat,\" Chung said. \"If we just beg for dialogue with the North and pass our time without substantive measures, we will face the so-called Korea passing,\" he added, referring to a situation in which Seoul is sidelined by major powers in important security affairs concerning the peninsula.The North's continued provocations, including its long-range missile tests last month, have provided political fodder for the conservative bloc to accentuate its professed security forte and sharpen criticism of the liberal camp's traditionally dovish approach.Yoo Seong-min, the former presidential candidate of the Bareun Party, joined the criticism, urging Moon to retract his key security decisions, such as shortening the mandatory military service period for draftees and suspending the full deployment of a US missile defense system pending an environmental impact assessment.\"For genuine peace, we have to make perfect preparations against any potential warfare,\" he said in a lengthy Facebook post.Brushing aside all criticism, ruling party leaders stressed that Moon's high approval rating attests to public satisfaction with his policy initiatives. They mentioned the government decisions to raise the minimum wage and tax rates for top-earning individuals and conglomerates, and efforts to address unfair business practices and real-estate speculation as the Moon government's major feats.\"We want to cautiously evaluate that we got the passing mark from the public regarding Moon's 100 days in office,\" Woo said in a radio interview.The ruling camp also sought to close ranks ahead of a regular parliamentary session slated to begin next month. The session is expected to be a political battleground over a series of legal revisions the Moon government is pursuing to retool the tax code and reform power organs such as the prosecution and spy agency. (Yonhap)","691":"North Korea's state media claimed Saturday that the South Korean military's unmanned aerial vehicle violated its airspace this week, calling it a \"grave military provocation.\"An official from the South Korean military dismissed the claim as \"untrue,\" saying it carried out a \"normal operation as planned.\"The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that the South's surveillance plane, called Heron, flew over its western border area four times between 7:46 a.m. and 8:40 p.m. on Friday.The KCNA said that the alleged violation was grave as it came when the United States brought its four Global Hawk spy drones and some 100 military personnel to Yokoda Air Base in Japan from their base in Guam on the pretext of avoiding a typhoon. It also blamed the South for escalating military tensions, warning of a \"merciless retaliatory response.\"In recent weeks, Pyongyang has ratcheted up military tensions through a series of ballistic missile tests, which many observers said indicated it is on course to develop a longer-range missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.On Sunday, the North fired an intermediate-range missile with its leader Kim Jong-un approving its deployment for combat use.The latest provocation followed the May 14 test of another missile, which experts presumed could have a range of around 5,000 kilometers. (Yonhap)","692":"The Moon Jae-in government will make a presidential panel to map out a long-term environmental road map and coordinate policies for sustainable development, his policy advisory panel said Friday.The \"sustainability\" panel will be formed by merging the two existing bodies -- the commission on sustainable development under the environmental ministry and the committee on green growth under the prime minister's office, the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee said, citing a government policy briefing.Park Kwang-on, the spokesman for the committee, said that the panel will set national environmental goals by next year based on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).The SDGs aim to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice and tackle climate change by 2030. The goals were endorsed in 2015 following a 15-year campaign to tackle poverty, disease and other global challenges under the Millennium Development Goals.During the environment ministry's policy briefing the same day, participants also reportedly discussed the idea of setting up a body on crafting measures to tackle fine dust under the presidential office. (Yonhap)","693":"Washington has recently finalized a four-point policy plan on North Korea that calls for applying \u201call available sanctions and pressure\u201d to incite the country to change its course and ultimately resolve the nuclear standoff through dialogue, South Korean lawmakers said Thursday. Joseph Yun, special representative for North Korea policy at the US State Department, introduced the plan to a group of visiting lawmakers led by Rep. Kim Kwan-young of the minor opposition People\u2019s Party.\u00a0(Yonhap)The department established four principles on North Korea: it will not recognize the communist country as a nuclear weapons state; impose all available sanctions and pressure; pursue no regime change; and resolve the problem through dialogue. The guidelines reflect the department\u2019s efforts to flesh out the so-called \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement\u201d policy line unveiled earlier. US President Donald Trump approved a comprehensive report detailing the strategy about two weeks ago, Kim quoted Yun as saying. While leaving open the possibility for talks, Yun stressed the current focus should stay on sanctions and pressure and that there would be no dialogue before Pyongyang shifts its attitude toward denuclearization. \u201cThe department officials questioned the possibility that the North would agree to talks, saying we should continue the sanctions campaign given no change in the North\u2019s position,\u201d the lawmaker told reporters in Washington. This may indicate possible future discord between Seoul and Washington, with President Moon Jae-in looking to a restart of inter-Korean dialogue and economic and humanitarian exchanges including the Kaesong industrial park and tours to Kumkangsan. The lawmakers also expressed concerns about the confusion in South Korea over the ongoing deployment here of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. Moon has pledged to seek parliamentary approval for the program but his ruling Democratic Party of Korea remains opposed to it. \u201cIt seemed if the THAAD dispute escalates to the extent where the deployment decision may be reversed, the US officials would take it very seriously,\u201d Kim said, noting that if put up for a vote, the plan will likely pass. \u201cThe US officials apparently didn\u2019t understand why we debate about a defensive weapon,\u201d said Rep. Jun Hee-kyung of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party. Democratic Party Rep. So Byung-hoon conveyed skepticism among US academics toward a resumption of the Kaesong and Kumkangsan initiatives in the face of North Korea\u2019s provocations and nuclear development. \u201cSome of those at think tanks were very negative about their restart, asking what economic benefits South Korea would gain from that,\u201d So said.\u00a0By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","694":"There will be no more police water cannons and bus barricades at street rallies, a ranking police officer said Friday, signaling a dramatic shift in the police\u2019s treatment of protestors after millions-strong demonstrations expelled a sitting president from power. \u201cFrom now on, we plan to make it a principle not to dispatch police forces, water cannons and bus barricades,\u201d said Lee Dae-hyung, a human rights protection officer from the National Police Agency during a forum on human rights and police held in Busan.\u00a0 (Yonhap)\u201cThe basis is likely to change that we allow rally organizers to autonomously run public assemblies.\u201dThat, along with other measures to uphold human rights during investigation or use of police authority, will be included in the National Policy Agency\u2019s briefing to President Moon Jae-in\u2019s de-facto transition committee, he added. The briefing to the State Affairs Policy Planning Committee is scheduled for Saturday. South Korea was once plagued by violent street demonstrations by university students and unionized workers, but the past winter\u2019s rallies against former President Park Geun-hye earned international praise as a peaceful, yet powerful grassroots movement. After Park was ousted, a human-rights lawyer turned liberal politician -- Moon Jae-in -- rose to the presidency. On Thursday, he ordered empowerment of the nation\u2019s human rights watchdog, while his civil affairs secretary pressured the state prosecution and police for better protection of basic rights of citizens. Human rights activists have been criticizing the police, in particular, for use of excessive forces at street protests and restricting the freedom of public assembly. In 2015, a blast from police water cannon knocked down activist farmer Baek Nam-gi during a demonstration in which protesters were attacking police buses. He died last year, after 317 days in coma. The police have in the past said that the dispatch of forces, police bus barricades and the use of water cannons are essential for them to maintain public order.

The man, showing no remorse, signs of being intimidated or fear for his own fate, confessed to killing two boys in 2004 and more. His cool-headed confession made investigators shudder. It was then that criminal profiler Kwon Il-yong was brought in.\u00a0 Kwon Il-yong (Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea Herald)Through a series of interviews with the suspect, Kwon managed to help resolve the case, analyzing Jeong\u2019s motives and obtaining full confessions to the killings of 13 people from January 2004 to April 2006. \u201cIt was the case that I will never forget for my entire life,\u201d recalled Kwon, now retired and enjoying life away from the world of crime. Jeong was sentenced to death in 2007 -- the death penalty remains in South Korea, but no executions have been carried out since 1997. Two years later, he hung himself in jail, with a noose that he made from plastic dust bags. Before his death, he is said to have remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to quit smoking, but not killing.\u201d \u201cPure evil itself -- I saw it in him,\u201d Kwon said during an interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Kwon started off his 28-year career with the police, as a patrol cop. After he was selected to become the nation\u2019s first criminal profiler 17 years ago, he was part of investigations into almost every major crime. He has interviewed over 1,000 criminals, including Yoo Young-chul, a serial killer and self-confessed cannibal who murdered 20 people, and Kang Ho-sun, who murdered eight women and killed his wife and mother-in-law by arson. He also pioneered the police\u2019s behavioral science-based investigation. Before his retirement in April, he was the head of the Criminal Behavior Analysis Team at the National Police Agency. In person, Kwon, 53, is a cordial man, with a disarming smile and observant eyes. When he spoke of his past work, his intensity and focus was a reminder of his trailblazing path in South Korea\u2019s approach to criminal investigation. \u201cEverybody reacts differently in a situation. A monster is born when a person\u2019s genetic factors meet with a bad environment,\u201d he said.As society changes, so does crime. In South Korea, breakneck economic development and social changes has had its impact on crime patterns and motivations, Kwon explained. \u201cBefore the early 1990s, criminal motivations were pretty clear. There was no need for investigators to adopt such modern investigation techniques such as criminal profiling. Most criminal activities at that time had something to do with poverty, personal revenge or love affairs, and could be explained as easily as they seemed on the surface.\u201dKillers who randomly selected their victims began to emerge noticeably in the 1990s, when social and political changes beset the country following democratization and the advent of global free trade. One of the most notable cases was that of the \u201cJijon clique,\u201d created in 1993 with the specific intention to kill.The seven members of the gang, all in their 20s, shared a grudge against their well-off, kidnapped victims and took them to the cellar of their rustic hideouts. There, they murdered, dismembered victims\u2019 bodies and ate their flesh. Five people -- all ordinary citizens not superrich-- lost their lives at their hands. \u201cHate crimes, which mostly target women and the weak, are an example that shows a growing sense of deprivation and alienation among underprivileged people of that time,\u201d said Kwon. Crimes of today are increasingly driven by \u201crage and anger\u201d caused by social inequality, he noted. \u201cFeeling deprived of opportunities to take roles in society, people commit horrendous acts of violence against others who they have no ties with, simply to feel superior to them and show their anger toward society. They believe that their actions are justified. These are certainly not a common type of crime you could see a few decades ago,\u201d said Kwon. He said he also grew up in a poor family, but the major difference between himself and such criminals was that \u201cI\u2019d never considered myself as being isolated from friends, colleagues and society.\u201d \u201cCriminals tend to believe they are deprived of the opportunities (to be part of society).\u201d Kwon acknowledged that he had battled with post-traumatic stress in the course of his work with brutal criminals. \u201cMemories linger on for quite some time,\u201d he said.He was also not free from fear. He recalled the shock he felt when he learned that a photo of him was found at the home of a suspect. To avoid letting work affect his upbeat personality, Kwon made it a rule to have a party after closing a case at a nearby pub, simply to talk. \u201cIt could be an unbearable burden if we (policemen) have to endure such mental pain all alone. We gather together often, just to exchange idle chitchat sometimes,\u201d he said.Having grown up in a Catholic family, faith also helped him to get through the day, Kwon said, quoting Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s admonishment that those who fight monsters risk becoming monsters themselves. Despite being a Catholic, Kwon said he supports capital punishment.\u201cIt seems to me that our judicial system is better than some people worry with regard to the possibility of executing falsely-charged, innocent citizens. I also believe that the statute of limitations should be abolished for serious crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cOr we could also consider allowing judges to give imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, like they do in the United States, to curb crimes.\u201d\u00a0By Bak Se-hwan (sh@heraldcorp.com)","696":"When Jeong Nam-kyu was first arrested for housebreaking and attempted murder in 2006, few imagined that the diminuitive, 37-year-old man would turn out to have been the perpetrator of a string of murders that shook the country for years.\u00a0The man, showing no remorse, signs of being intimidated or fear for his own fate, confessed to killing two boys in 2004 and more.

(Yonhap)The reform panel will also explore ways to restructure the military's top commanding structure, enhance the arms acquisition process, upgrade key weapons systems and boost the morale of the country's 625,000 troops.\"All these (reform) tasks are related to the budgetary issues,\" Park said, noting that the new government will seek to jack up defense spending.Moon has called for a phased increase of the country's defense budgets to around 3 percent of the gross domestic product, tallied at US$1.47 trillion, from 2.4 percent now.The spokesman also said that the defense reform will be carried out in a way that will ensure the \"balanced\" development of the Army, Navy and Air Force and promote seamless cooperation among all armed services.The defense briefing was part of a series of policy presentations to the advisory committee formed to make up for the lack of a transition period for Moon. The new president was sworn in earlier this month without any preparatory time due to the March 10 ouster of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye.A major issue at the defense briefing was whether the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on the peninsula requires parliamentary approval although its key elements have already been delivered to the site.On his campaign trail, Moon repeatedly said that the THAAD deployment requires parliamentary ratification, noting that the former government failed to build public consensus on the crucial security decision.Those supportive of Moon's position have mentioned a constitutional clause stipulating that the legislature has the right to consent to any treaty involving an \"important financial obligation.\" Seoul has provided land worth around 89 billion won ($79.6 million) to host the US battery.However, the defense ministry has insisted that the deployment was not a matter for parliamentary consent as it is covered under the South Korea-US mutual defense treaty already approved by the National Assembly.At the briefing, the issues of retaking wartime operational control from Washington were also expected to be discussed.During the election campaign, Moon pledged to push for the transfer of wartime operational control within his five-year term that ends in 2022. In 2014, Seoul and Washington agreed to a \"conditions-based\" OPCON transfer in light of evolving North Korean threats, delaying the transition previously scheduled for December 2015. They did not set a specific date for the transfer, but observers presume it may come in the mid-2020s.Lee Su-hoon, the chief of the committee's subpanel on security, stressed that the nation has to be able to provide for its own defense -- an apparent allusion to the need for the OPCON transition.\"We should strengthen our capabilities to respond to the North's nuclear and missile threats, and push for the OPCON transfer while ensuring a firm South Korea-US alliance,\" Lee said during his opening remarks.\"It is time to ensure security not just in our words ... but real security capabilities that can ably safeguard the lives of our citizens and their properties ... The Moon government will, for sure, ensure security.\"He also stressed the need to stamp out deep-rooted corruption in the defense industry and enhance the welfare and human rights conditions for military draftees.

A day later, it said that it was probably a balloon.(Yonhap)The General Staff of the Korean People's Army said that the South fired more than 450 shots at \"a flock of birds into the North Korean side, sparking another armed provocation across the border.\"The recent military provocation is a stopgap measure to check the war-weariness sweeping the puppet army in the face of the rapidly developing nuclear and ballistic rocket technology of the DPRK,\" a spokesman at the military was quoted as saying by North Korea's state agency.The DPRK refers to the abbreviation of North Korea's full name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.North Korea said that South Korea has blamed the North for high-profile incidents including landmine explosions near the border in 2015 and the torpedoing of a South Korean warship in March 2010.\"The KPA is closely following the new confrontation hysteria of the provokers getting all the more reckless,\" the spokesman said.South Korea's military dismissed the North's claims.\"It is the North Korean military's one-sided argument.

President Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)The new president has been striving to swiftly round out his government to minimize any policy vacuum. He took office soon after his victory in the May 9 election triggered by the March 10 ouster of his scandal-hit predecessor, Park Geun-hye.Moon has so far announced his picks for prime minister, deputy prime minister for economic affairs, foreign minister, spy chief and Constitutional Court president, as well as some top presidential officials.For the post of deputy prime minister for social affairs, Kim Sang-gon, former superintendent of Gyeonggi Province Office of Education, has been mentioned. He was deeply involved in the formation of Moon's campaign pledges for education.Kim Boo-kyum, four-term lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party, has been floated as new interior minister. Kim served as one of the chief campaigners for Moon during the election period.Former Chief of Naval Operations Song Young-moo is being talked about as a possible defense minister.

(Yonhap)\"The North Korean nuclear issue could never be resolved through war. That's impossible,\" Song also quoted Putin as saying during their 45-minute meeting in Moscow. \"The problem should be solved through dialogue because using sanctions alone has limitations, and it could also work against North Korean people and incur humanitarian issues.\"The president also stressed the need to resume the forum of the six concerned countries, known as the six-party talks, to negotiate ways to deal with the North Korean issue as well as the need to open direct talks between North Korea and the United States.Putin said he will hold a phone conversation with US President Donald Trump to talk him into resuming dialogue with Kim Jong-un, according to Song, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party.Touching on South Korea's staging of the US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, Putin reiterated Russia's opposition.\"The THAAD system has limits in its effectiveness to fend against North Korea's long-range artillery. ... The problem of (North Korean nuclear and missile development) cannot be resolved by military responses only,\" Putin was also quoted as saying. Also discussed in the meeting were several trilateral economic cooperation projects involving the two Koreas and Russia, which were suspended in early 2016 following North Korea's nuclear tests and missile provocations. They include the trilateral logistics project aimed to link the three countries' sea ports to transport Russian coal to South Korea via North Korea. Putin expressed intentions to resume those economic projects, stressing that such joint work could help resolve tensions on the peninsula. They shared the understanding that South Korea needs to make efforts to pursue trilateral economic projects and agreed to discuss the issue further during a future summit between Moon and Putin.A free trade agreement between South Korea and the Russia-led regional block, the Eurasian Economic Union, and a bilateral project to jointly develop Arctic shipping routes were also suggested during the meeting, according to Song. Moon and Putin are set to meet in July on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Germany. Putin expressed his expectations for the summit and invited Moon to the Eastern Economic Forum that Russia is to host on Sept. 6-7.Song conveyed Moon's handwritten letter to Putin and Moon's messages indicating that he is eager to step up bilateral relations with Russia.With the meeting with Putin, Song wrapped up his Russian trip and plans to head back to Seoul on Thursday.

He previously served as the Defense Ministry\u2019s arms control team chief and represented the ministry in several key negotiations including the six-party talks. Kim Ki-jung (Yonhap)Kim Ki-jung, chief of Yonsei University\u2019s Graduate School of Public Administration, was named the second chief of the office to supervise diplomatic affairs, unification policies and cyber national security.Speculations had been rampant earlier in the day that the Blue House would tap a former senior military official for the first deputy chief position in order to achieve balance within the national security office. This arose due to concerns that the office needs more military officials in order to respond to military provocations from North Korea and forthcoming summits with key partner states.President Moon, upon restructuring his secretariat on May 11, reallocated the role of the senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security to the national security office, seeking integration and improved response capacities.The two deputy advisers are to work under recently appointed national security chief Chung Eui-yong to steer the presidential office\u2019s actions concerning foreign affairs, national defense and North Korean issues.\u201cWith the Korea-UN summit planned (in June) prior to the Group of 20 summit (slated for July), we are pressed for time and need to establish the national security office as soon as possible,\u201d Chung told reporters Sunday, following his appointment to the post.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","707":"An international youth environment organization said Wednesday that it will hold a peace march and a tree-planting to call for the creation of a \"peace forest\" inside the Demilitarized Zone bisecting the two Koreas next month. \"Some 300 youth from around the world and diplomats (stationed in South Korea) will join the Peace March set for June 23 at Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, north of Seoul, under the slogan of \"Above politics.

The event has been held annually since 2012 under the auspices of South Korea's Unification Ministry. (Yonhap)","708":"A senior ruling party official Wednesday rejected conservatives' growing calls for the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, saying it would amount to recognizing the North as a nuclear power.During a radio interview, Woo Won-shik, the floor leader of the Democratic Party, also warned that the redeployment could also provoke China and Russia, spark an arms race in Northeast Asia and thus destabilize the Korean Peninsula.Amid heightened tensions triggered by the North's repeated missile tests and bellicose rhetoric, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party has demanded the redispatch of the US arsenal, which was withdrawn following an inter-Korean declaration for a nuclear-free peninsula in 1991. Woo Won-shik, the floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party, speaks during a forum at the National Assembly in Seoul on Aug. 16, 2017. (Yonhap)\"If the LKP claims the need for the redeployment, (South Korea) will immediately fall into a case of self-contradiction as it would be like making the North's nuclear-armed status a fait accompli,\" Woo told local broadcaster CBS.\"The main opposition party must not make dangerous remarks without serious consideration just to oppose the government's policy line,\" he added.Woo went on to say that the call for the redeployment is a \"claim that would benefit the North.\"\"If we recognize the North as a nuclear-armed state, then it would become a de facto nuclear power. How can we then demand the North's dismantlement of its nuclear program?\" he said. The liberal Moon Jae-in government has pursued a peaceful resolution of the North's nuclear conundrum based on its two-pronged policy of sanctions and dialogue. But the LKP has railed against the policy, calling on the government to take more stringent measures, such as pursuing a \"nuclear balance of power\" with the North.Touching on the criticism, Woo urged the opposition parties to stop any political moves that would undercut Seoul's negotiating power in future talks with the reclusive regime. The politician also called on the North to stop its provocative acts and rhetoric, and discard its \"adventurous thinking,\" stressing that only its denuclearization and change in its behavior would guarantee its future.

He said that if the Trump administration wants peace on the Korean Peninsula it should replace the Armistice Agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War with a peace accord and halt its anti-North Korea policy, \"the root cause of all problems.\"The Trump administration has said there should be no talks until North Korea takes steps toward getting rid of its nuclear arsenal. During Tuesday's Security Council meeting, members were briefed by UN political chief Jeffrey Feltman, mainly on technical aspects of the weekend launch.Uruguay's UN Ambassador Elbio Rosselli, the current council president, said it was the 11th this year \"which basically means a quantum leap and determined effort to acquire aggressive capabilities, and that is of major concern.\"Japan's UN Ambassador Koro Bessho told reporters afterward that \"North Korea is acting in triumphant and emboldened manner by this most recent launch, and is now clearly demonstrating that it is determined to further bolster its nuclear build-up.\"Calling the provocations \"an enormous global threat,\" he said \"the international community must not leave this total defiance of the Security Council unanswered.\"Bessho said Japan hopes the council will \"strengthen the measures and strengthen the sanctions mechanism.\"He said Japan is talking to the US, South Korea, and close neighbors Russia and China to make sure pressure on the North is continued \"and even strengthened so that North Korea will change its policy.\" (AP)","711":"The chief of the presidential policy planning advisory panel said Tuesday that it would explore ways to stamp out deep-seated corruption in the defense industry, long blamed for eroding the country's military capabilities.During a regular press briefing, Kim Jin-pyo also said the panel would seek a \"comprehensive\" approach to ensure that any anti-corruption campaign will not compromise the competitiveness of local defense firms. Kim Jin-pyo, the chief of the presidential policy planning advisory panel, speaks during a press conference at his office in Seoul on May 23, 2017.

It serves as a power transition team for Moon as his five-year presidency began without any preparatory period due to the March 10 ouster of his scandal-hit predecessor, Park Geun-hye.During Moon's election campaign, he warned that he would sternly deal with any irregularities in defense deals, comparing them to \"activities benefiting the enemy.\"Meanwhile, Kim also said that his panel will review whether to scrap a performance-based wage system that the former government pushed to introduce in public corporations on the grounds that it would increase productivity and efficiency. The wage system had drawn much flak with critics arguing it was unilaterally introduced without due consultations with or consent from trade unions. \"As this issue was raised strongly during the election campaign, the panel's division in charge of social affairs will look into it,\" Kim said.Touching on the five-year state management plan in the making, Kim said that the panel will compress Moon's 201 campaign pledges into 100 to more effectively set up policy goals to deliver on them. \"It is a matter of categorization... it is not like reducing the number of pledges to 100,\" Kim said.

He was quoted as telling the military to put the missile into actual operation.\"Saying with pride that the missile's rate of hits is very accurate and Pukguksong-2 is a successful strategic weapon, he approved the deployment of this weapon system for action,\" the Korean Central News Agency said.It added Kim was satisfied with the images of the Earth sent in real time from a camera mounted on the missile.The North appears to be taking a dual-track approach in its nuclear program, seeking to develop the Pukguksong-2 missile that can be launched on a mobile launcher and the liquid-fueled Hwasong-12 IRBM with the aim of mastering technology for an intercontinental ballistic missile.Asked if the Pukguksong-2 is presumed to be capable of striking Guam, the JCS official said, it seems like the North is not there yet, citing an analysis by related authorities here.Roh wouldn't be drawn into a question related to Pyongyang's claim of the Earth photos.\"It's a matter that needs to be confirmed (through additional analysis),\" he said.He was also cautious about whether the North has the missile technology for atmospheric re-entry.

Kim Jin-pyo, the head of the state affairs planning advisory committee, speaks during a meeting at its office in Seoul on May 22, 2017. (Yonhap)The committee was formed as the Moon administration was launched without a ual two-month government transition period due to the March 10 oter of scandal-hit former President Park Geun-hye. It is set to run for up to 70 days.\"The president has advocated for changing the overall social and economic paradigm into income-based growth,\" Kim told reporters, referring to Moon's economic formula aimed at addressing income disparities and boosting growth by creating jobs and increasing hoehold revenue.\"What matters the most is creating many jobs .... We have to create a 'golden triangle' in which growth, employment and welfare go together,\" he added.During his election campaign, Moon vowed to create 810,000 new quality jobs in the public sector during his five-year presidency that began on May 10. For this, he pledged to ask parliament for 10 trillion won ($8.9 billion) in a supplementary budget. Kim, the former deputy minister and four-term lawmaker, also pointed out that economic and social policies mt be formulated and implemented in an \"integrative and organic\" fashion. \"That is what the Moon Jae-in administration thinks about (how these policies should be crafted and work),\" he said. \"These policies will not be separately made or have any vertical relationship among one another.\"Stressing the importance of reflecting public opinion in the policy formulation process, Kim said that the committee will run an apparat to ensure citizens' participation and be in close contact with them through regular policy briefings.\"So as to guarantee active popular sovereignty, we will run a communication body ... We will actively solicit citizens' opinions,\" he said. Kim also warned committee members against \"acting as if they were occupying forces,\" calling on them to show a leadership that can command respect and support from public servants and citizens.The committee plans to receive briefings from government ministries and agencies from Wednesday to Friday, Park Kwang-on, its spokesman, told reporters.

Chung Eui-yong, a former ambassador to Geneva who was named chief of the National Security Office, also said the deployment of the US advanced missile system lacks \u201cprocedural legitimacy\u201d and that as far as he understands neighboring countries also respect Seoul\u2019s position on the defense equipment. \u201cIt is quite unnatural to see suspension in the talks between the two Koreas. As far as the inter-Korean relations, I am convinced that we should take the lead to restore the relations,\u201d Chung told reporters at Cheong Wa Dae after his appointment was announced. The security chief, however, noted that an immediate change to the two-Korea relations is unlikely -- such as the reopening of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic project that was regarded as a symbol of cross-border cooperation until it was \u201ctemporarily\u201d closed in 2016 by former President Park Geun-hye.\u00a0 South Korea`s National Security Office chief Chung Eui-yong. YonhapHis remarks appear to signal a shift in the new Moon administration\u2019s foreign policy and inter-Korean relations from a military-based, hawkish and bilateral approach under the previous administration to diplomacy-based, conciliatory and multilateral one, observers said. \u201cUnlike the previous Park Geun-hye administration, the Moon Jae-in government will pursue a proactive approach in foreign policy and inter-Korean talks to bring the North to a negotiation table,\u201d said Chung Seong-jang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute in Seoul.Over the past Park Geun-hye administration, inter-Korea relations and major diplomatic decisions were mostly discussed among former generals who served as defense ministers, like Ret. Army Gen. Kim Gwan-jin who has worked as a security chief since 2014. But those military figures were under criticism for worsening military tension by disregarding diplomatic approaches toward North Korea.\u00a0 \u201cWhen it comes to North Korea\u2019s nuclear crisis, diplomacy should play more of a role,\u201d said Moon when he announced his appointment of Chung. \u201cThe past governments have viewed security in the context of national defense. But diplomacy is another side of security.\u201d High on the agenda is how to reconcile the new government\u2019s shift in focus with the US government\u2019s assertive stance against North Korea, which fired a ballistic missile later in the day in defiance of international condemnation. On Tuesday, Chung met with US delegates led by Matt Pottinger, senior director for East Asia at the White House\u2019s National Security Council. During the meeting, both sides agreed to seek \u201cbold and pragmatic steps\u201d in resolving Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambition pledged to mobilize all available means including sanctions and dialogue, though dialogue with the North is possible only under the right conditions. Regarding the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Chung is known to have told his counterpart that there are \u201cissues\u201d with the procedure leading to the deployment, indicating that the measure needs parliamentary approval. Pottinger later said the deployment was a \u201csettled matter.\u201d Along with Chung, Moon also appointed a renowned pro-engagement scholar Moon Chung-in as his special adviser for unification, foreign affairs and national security. The Seoul-based Yonsei University professor had led the rapprochement policy with North Korea under the previous liberal administration of President Roh Moo-hyun. The professor had long stressed that restoring two-Korea relations is the key to resolving decadeslong military confrontation on the peninsula. Former chairman of presidential committee on Northeast Asia during the Roh administration, Moon Chung-in had asserted that Seoul should assume \u201cthe role as a balancer\u201d to coordinate interest among surrounding regional powers such as the US and China.\u00a0By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","723":"Following weeks of yellow dust storms and high fine dust levels, South Korea is seeing a rise of ozone concentration levels in the air, which experts said are just as harmful as dust particles.

According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, a daytime high in Seoul on Sunday reached 28 degree Celsius, a summer heat normally expected at around mid-July to August. Daytime highs reached 29 degrees Celsius in Daejeon and Gwangju, and 30 degrees Celsius in Gangneung and Daegu. Citizens resting by water to beat the summer heat at Han River Park in Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)The KMA said daytime highs will hover around 30 degree Celsius across the nation until Tuesday.With the mercury rising, the ozone concentration and ultraviolet index are likely to rise as well, according to a local weather forecast agency K-weather.As of Sunday afternoon, ozone concentration levels were \u201cbad\u201d in metropolitan areas, inculding Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungcheong, and Jeolla Provinces.Hot and dry summer weather normally intensifies ozone problems as sunlight reacts with emissions from cars, trucks and other sources to create ozone, the main ingredient in smog, experts say.Experts warn that breathing ozone can trigger health problems such as chest pain, coughing and throat irritation. Children, older adults and those already suffering respiratory problems are advised to take extra precautions when the ozone concentration level is high.\u201cWe are still experiencing a somewhat still bad quality of air after the country\u2019s worst fine dust earlier this year, but I guess it is not the time to take masks off outside yet, with high ozone concentration problem to peak this summer,\u201d said 31-year-old mother living in Suwon.South Korea\u2019s ozone concentration figures were seen worsening over the recent decades. The ozone concentration went up from 66 micrograms per cubic meter in 1990 to 68 micrograms in 2015. The OECD average fell slightly from 61 to 60 micrograms during the same period. Weather forecast encouraged citizens to avoid outdoor activities and to put on sun screen for protection during the daytime when ozone concentration is at its peak. Skies will be relatively clear until Wednesday when sporadic rainfall is expected in parts of the country, reducing the temperature temporarily, the weather forecast said.\u00a0By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","724":"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday Washington has no intention for a regime change or invasion of North Korea, urging it to abandon its nuclear program in return for regime security and an end to hostility, according to Seoul\u2019s special envoys.Tillerson made the remarks during his meeting with Hong Seok-hyun, a former chairman of JoongAng Media Network who is visiting Washington as President Moon Jae-in\u2019s special envoy. During the 40-minute talks, Tillerson expressed the country\u2019s willingness to return to dialogue with Pyongyang if it shows sincerity through actions such as a halt in nuclear and missile tests, an official at Hong\u2019s delegation said.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference at the State Department in Washington, DC.

But the official said Tillerson\u2019s remarks did not appear to mean any easing of preconditions for dialogue, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the North\u2019s nuclear program remaining unchanged. \u201cThe US\u2019 first-stage objective is that Pyongyang does not carry out additional nuclear and missile tests,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the level of preconditions is quite high, and North Korea is supposed to take substantial activity first by refraining from the tests for a while before the atmosphere for talks starts to form.\u201dUS special envoy Hong Seok-hyun (Yonhap)Hong also quoted Tillerson as saying there are a multitude of US businesses willing to invest in the North which would help rebuild the crumbling economy if it makes the right choice. \u201cI was most impressed to see the US\u2019 resolve for engagement that it pursues sanctions and pressure not to harass North Korea but to foster an opportunity for its development by opening its doors and abolishing its nuclear program in the long term,\u201d Hong said. With China taking economic retaliation against South Korea over the deployment of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile shield, Tillerson noted Beijing is moving to relax its sanctions on Lotte Group, which provided land for the system, another delegation member said. \u201cChina knows that THAAD poses absolutely no threat to its own security,\u201d Tillerson was quoted as saying. \u201cThe issue regarding the range of X-Band radar is not a problem China should be worried about.\u201d On his second day in Washington, Hong held a series of meetings with congressional leaders including Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep.

Delivering Moon's letter, Lee said that he was asked to express gratitude on his behalf for Xi's congratulatory phone call and message following his election and inauguration last week.Lee's visit to China came amid Beijing's continued protest against South Korea's decision last year to allow a U.S. missile defense system called THAAD to be installed on its soil. China has taken what appeared to be retaliatory steps against South Korean companies in diverse areas, apparently in a bid to put pressure on South Korea to withdraw its plan for the THAAD installation, which it sees as a threat to its own strategic security interests.Lee, who served as prime minister under the Roh Moo-hyun government from 2004-2006, embarked on his trip to Beijing on Thursday when he met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Wang told him that he hoped South Korea's new government will take measures to \"remove the obstacles\" in order to improve their bilateral relations.Earlier in the day, Lee also met with Chinese State Councilor for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi, who told the South Korean envoy that the meeting was an important opportunity for Beijing-Seoul communication and that China is willing to keep exchanging views with South Korea on issues of mutual concern. Some are cautiously raising hopes that both countries might be moving toward mending their ties frayed over the THAAD issue, with China apparently easing some restrictions on South Korea taken in retaliation.During his stay in Beijing, meanwhile, Lee is expected to discuss key pending issues with China, including the THAAD controversy, cooperation against North Korea's nuclear threat and near-future summit talks between the two countries.

But I decided to step down believing I must be the first one to give up what I have in order to win the people's trust in regard to the recent incident,\" Lee Chang-jae said.Lee, a vice minister, has been serving as an acting head of the justice ministry since late November when former minister Kim Hyun-woong stepped down, citing the then ongoing investigations against the person who had appointed him to the top judiciary post, Park Geun-hye.South Korea's acting justice minister Lee Chang-jae (Yonhap)Lee's resignation offer came one day after the ministry launched an internal investigation against a ranking ministry official, Ahn Tae-geun, over providing what he earlier claimed to be cash bonuses to prosecutors who had questioned a former prosecutor and the former president's top aide for civil affairs, Woo Byung-woo.The money, however, is widely considered kickbacks for their failure to have Woo detained.The former chief secretary for civil affairs to Park currently faces a trial on several charges that include abuse of power. But he is one of a very few to face trial without physical detention in relation to the corruption scandal involving the former president and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.Many believe the prosecution's failure to detain Woo may have been intentional.Such suspicions have apparently prompted President Moon Jae-in to order a special investigation.The justice ministry launched a 10-person team Thursday to investigate Ahn and others involved in the incident.The state prosecutors' office has also set up a 12-person team to question its own officials, including Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul district prosecutors' office.The investigation teams were said earlier to have demanded a written report from each and every person involved.This combined photo shows Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office (L) and Ahn Tae-geun, ranking official at the Ministry of Justice.

It couldn\u2019t have been more different this year. Liberal President Moon Jae-in, taking office after two conservative presidents, turned the otherwise dull, perfunctory event into an emotional revisit of the nation\u2019s turbulent path to democracy, paved with the blood of Gwangju citizens.President Moon Jae-in hugs Kim So-hyung, whose father was killed during the May 18th Gwangju Uprising, during a ceremony marking the 37th anniversary of the democratic movement in the southern city of Gwangju on Thursday. (Yonhap)\u201cI dare tell you here and now that the new Moon Jae-in government stands in line with the legacy of the Gwangju Democratization Movement,\u201d said Moon in his address at the national cemetery, vowing to protect and further advance the country\u2019s hard-earned democracy. The 37th-year anniversary was honored with the biggest number of participants, some 10,000, including President Moon himself, since the day was designated as a national anniversary in 1997. For the first time in nine years, the crowd sang \u201cMarch for the Beloved,\u201d a song symbolic of the spirit of the 1980 civilian uprising. Many shed tears and expressed satisfaction at the way the day was remembered and patriots honored. The May 18 Democratic Uprising was a pro-democracy movement in 1980, where citizens protested against the military dictatorship of Gen. Chun Doo-hwan. He took power through a military coup and expanded the martial law throughout the country, shutting down universities and banning political speeches. As more than 200,000 Gwangju citizens took to the streets, hundreds were killed and wounded during the nine-day protest as Chun ordered the most violent crackdown in the nation\u2019s modern history.At the time, it was defined as a riot with North Korea masterminding the developments. Although the massacre was later officially recognized by the government as a grassroots rebellion against the dictatorship, Gwangju\u2019s strong association with the liberal political faction amid the acrimonious rivalry between the left and the right has made it difficult for many conservatives to truly accept it. The previous conservative presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye only paid tribute in the annual event in their first year in office. After that, prime ministers and other high-ranking officials took on the role. During their term, \u201cMarch for the Beloved\u201d couldn\u2019t be sung by the participants. It was only allowed to be played by a choir. President Moon ordered last Friday that the song be sung as part of the ceremony. President Moon said he would conduct a thorough investigation into the killings and find out who is responsible for the bloody attack, indirectly pointing at the then-commander in chief, Chun himself. \u201cThe new government will exert efforts in finding out the truth about that day, including who ordered the first shot (at civilians) and hold (the person in charge) to account.\u201dMoon also reiterated his earlier promise to include the May 18 spirit in the nation\u2019s Constitution, so people can learn about and remember the country\u2019s history of democratization.The new leader\u2019s support uplifted the sentiments of the survivors and the bereaved families. \u201cWhat Moon is doing is for the people of the nation. I am glad he has acted to acknowledge the historical event,\u201d Yang Don-sil, 87, told The Korea Herald. She lost her sixth son, Kim Yong-pyo in the bloody crackdown.Lee Chang-hee was arrested, tortured and jailed only two months after he enrolled at the Chonnam National University in 1980. \u201cI feel guilty to be alive in front of all the victims here,\u201d the 55-year-old said, sitting in a wheelchair in the front of the stage. He said that he can now finally breathe, as he could not for the past 10 years with the conservative presidents in office.

Still, he felt strongly about the song, \u201cMarch for the Beloved.\u201d For liberal politicians, the ceremony epitomized the change of the era, or the arrival of their era. Many turned emotional. \u201cI was touched how the whole new Republic of Korea revealed itself in a symbolic way through the May 18 memorial ceremony,\u201d said the newly elected floor leader Woo Won-shik of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, hailing the renewed tone of the long-neglected ceremony.South Chungcheong Gov.

Hong Seok-hyun, a former chairman of JoongAng Media Network who also served as an ambassador to the US, met with Trump on his first day of a visit as President Moon Jae-in\u2019s special envoy. During the 15-minute talk, the sides discussed what would be the first summit between the two leaders, slated for late June in Washington. They are expected to coordinate policy on North Korea, the deployment of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile shield here and other key issues.US President Donald Trump (Yonhap)\u201c(Trump) spoke about sanctions on North Korea and cooperation with China. He also said he looks forward to working closely with President Moon in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue so as to attain results,\u201d Hong told reporters after the meeting. \u201cThough we\u2019re now at the stage of pressure and sanctions, (Trump) said he is willing to build peace through engagement if certain conditions are created. But he said he will not have talks with North Korea for the sake of talks, but those that could produce an outcome.\u201d Hong delivered Moon\u2019s letter, conveying the president\u2019s gratitude for Washington\u2019s unwavering security commitment and the early summit plan. Among other participants in the session were Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.The envoy dispatch set in motion Seoul\u2019s summit diplomacy following a seven-month void that has fueled concerns that the country may be losing its voice on critical matters, including North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear and missile threats.US special envoy Hong Seok-hyun (Yonhap)Moon\u2019s messengers to China and Japan, senior Democratic Party of Korea lawmakers Moon Hee-sang and Lee Hae-chan, are currently in their respective mission countries. Sogang University economist Cho Yoon-jae departed for Brussels earlier in the day as the representative to the European Union and Germany, while other envoys to Russia and the Vatican are expected to begin their journeys shortly. With about a month left before the summit with Trump, concerns have been rising over potential discord between the two leaders, due chiefly to Moon\u2019s pursuit of a restart of dialogue with Pyongyang despite escalating international sanctions and a pressure campaign. The liberal president also seeks parliamentary approval for the ongoing THAAD stationing, for which Trump has called for Seoul to pay $1 billion. \u201cPresident Trump talked largely about the big picture and stressed that we can achieve an outcome through the strong unity of the alliance and international cooperation,\u201d Hong said.But the THAAD issue was not brought up at the meeting with Trump, he noted, though McMaster expressed his understanding of the related controversy in South Korea during separate talks. \u201cI spoke on the controversy that aroused during the deployment process, as well as the need for the National Assembly to discuss the matter,\u201d Hong said. \u201c(McMaster) said he is aware of the procedural problem in South Korea and understands it.\u201d In Beijing, Lee said Moon may have his first face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference in July in Hamburg, Germany. \u201cA first summit is possible in Hamburg, and another one around Aug. 24 to mark the 25th anniversary of the relationship\u2019s establishment, which I plan to offer to (Xi),\u201d he told reporters upon his landing in Beijing. Given China\u2019s economic retaliation over the THAAD program, he will also urge Xi\u2019s understanding during his trip, which he said would be a chance to lay the foundation for a thaw in relations. \u201cNow the relations are severely strained so I will focus on resolving problems on economic exchanges, Hallyu and tourism,\u201d Lee said. In Tokyo, Moon Hee-sang met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for about 30 minutes, during which the premier expressed his resolve for \u201cfuture-oriented\u201d ties with what he called the country\u2019s most important neighbor that shares strategic interests.While President Moon signaled opposition to a December 2015 settlement on a wartime sex slavery row in last week\u2019s phone call, Abe reiterated his hopes for its \u201csteady\u201d implementation, stressing its nature as an intergovernmental accord. Moon said he also delivered the president\u2019s desire for future-oriented ties, a resumption of \u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d between the two leaders and greater cooperation on North Korea\u2019s threats. \u201cThe keyword in the president\u2019s letter is that let\u2019s meet often and exchange often,\u201d the lawmaker told reporters. \u201cI talked about the recovery of shuttle diplomacy (to Abe) and he welcomed it.\u201dThe two leaders are also likely to meet on the margins of the G-20 summit. Abe also raised concerns about the president\u2019s remarks during the campaign that he would visit Pyongyang and the Kaesong industrial park first, instead of Washington, saying it may be \u201ctoo hasty.\u201d The envoy, in response, explained the precondition that significant progress should be made on nuclear issues, as well as sufficient consultations with the US and Japan, before any reconciliation with the communist state were to take place. But Moon declined to elaborate on their discussions on the sex slavery deal or its renegotiation, though he reiterated the public sentiment that \u201ccannot accept\u201d the agreement during a separate session with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida a day ago.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","732":"Former President Park Geun-hye's doctors received prison terms Thursday for treating her without meeting due legal procedures or perjury in relation to a corruption scandal that removed Park from office.

Kim's wife was also found to have given an extra 31 million won worth of kickbacks to the couple and 10 million won to another presidential aide between 2015 and 2016.She was sentenced to a year in prison, and Kim was ordered to pay a fine of 3 million won. Dr. Kim Sang-man was ordered to pay a 10 million-won fine for fabricating medical records to conceal his treatments of Park.The court took into consideration that he inevitably faked the records as the president asked that her identity be concealed and that he did not seem to have gained any profits through the wrongdoing. Medical professor Chung Kee-yang at Yonsei University was sentenced to a year in prison for perjury. He served as Park's dermatology consultant from 2013 to 2014. He is accused of denying during the parliamentary inquiry that he planned to give Park a beauty treatment that was developed by Dr. Kim Young-jae. \"The defendant lied to prevent possible backlashes to himself and his hospital,\" the court said. \"It is equivalent to lying to the whole nation.\" Lee Im-soon, medical professor at Sunchunhyang University, who was also indicted for perjury, received a 10-month prison term, suspended for two years. The court considered her acknowledgment of her wrongdoing.At the parliamentary hearing she lied, denying that she introduced Kim Young-jae and his wife to Suh Chang-suk, CEO of Seoul National University Hospital.

The envoy's visit to Japan came amid protracted friction over a controversial deal reached in 2015 between the two countries to end a long-running dispute over Japan's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women. Under the December 2015 deal, Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to launch a foundation dedicated to supporting the surviving victims of sexual slavery. It also promised to contribute 1 billion yen (US$9.97 million) to the foundation launched last year. Critics still doubt the sincerity of the apology and also criticized that the deal was hastily arranged without sufficiently seeking the opinions of victims. In a telephone conversation with Abe last week after his inauguration, President Moon said that many Korean people cannot accept the deal emotionally, hinting at a possible move to renegotiate the deal. The special envoy echoed the president's view Wednesday when he met with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. He also called for joint efforts to resolve the problem with wisdom.Asked whether they discussed the issue during the meeting with Abe, the envoy told reporters that they did but declined to go into detail.He still answered \"yes\" to a question whether he sufficiently explained President Moon's stance to the Japanese leader.

It was a chance for me to wake up to the seriousness of misogyny and discrimination in Korean society,\u201d Suh Jung-hyun, a 19-year-old university student told The Korea Herald. \u201cBefore the murder, I was not happy about having to be careful at night just because I was a girl.

He waited for about 50 minutes in the restroom, while six men entered and left, before he killed the first woman who entered the bathroom, according to CCTV footage. Kim said he had committed the crime because he had been \u201cignored and belittled\u201d by women many times in the past.Mourners march across Gangnam, southern Seoul, Wednesday, marking the first-year anniversary of the Gangnam Station murder. (Yonhap)After the incident came to light, exit 10 of Gangnam Station transformed into a memorial site with people leaving flowers and written notes to mourn the death of the young woman and express their anger toward violence targeting women. A year after the killing, justice has been done. The murderer is locked up in prison, where he is to stay for 30 years. Yet, many mourners who gathered felt their fight against misogyny and hate crimes had a long way to go.\u201cI still fear violence against women.

These threats are not welcome',\" Haley told reporters ahead of the meeting.Nikki Haley (center), US ambassador to the United Nations, arrives for a press briefing before a meeting of the United Nations Security Council concerning North Korea (AFP-Yonhap)\"If you are a country that is supplying or supporting North Korea, we will call you out on it,\" Haley said.\"We will make sure that everyone knows who you are and we will target those sanctions towards you as well.\"Despite the push for a tougher stance, Haley held out the prospect of direct talks with North Korea, saying \"we are willing to talk but not until we see a total stop of the nuclear process and of any test there\".North Korea launched Sunday what appeared to be its longest-range ballistic missile yet, saying it was capable of carrying a \"heavy nuclear warhead\" in a test aimed at bringing the US mainland within reach.The United States, Japan and South Korea called the emergency meeting to press international demands that North Korea change course and dismantle its missile and nuclear programs.No draft resolution was circulated to the full council, but Haley said the United States was working with China on a text.\"That's what we are working on now. We don't have it done yet,\" Haley said.\"Absolutely, sanctions (are) something that we are looking at and we are going to continue to see where that takes us.\"During the closed-door meeting however, China made no mention of a new sanctions resolution and renewed its appeal for talks to de-escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula, according to diplomats.Sanctions a way to goAddressing reporters after the meeting, the council president, Uruguay's Ambassador Elbio Rosselli, said that \"clearly sanctions are a way to go\" but stressed support for diplomacy to engage with Pyongyang.North Korea has carried out two atomic tests and dozens of missile launches since the beginning of last year in its quest to develop a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States.In a unanimous statement backed by China, the council on Monday agreed to take further significant measures, including sanctions.Among the possible measures could be an oil embargo, trade bans and targeted sanctions on North Korean individuals and companies, but these hinge on China's willingness to apply such measures.The Security Council adopted two sanctions resolutions last year to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang and deny leader Kim Jong-Un the hard currency needed to fund his military programs.In all, six sets of sanctions have been imposed on North Korea since it first tested an atomic device in 2006.Under UN resolutions, North Korea is barred from developing nuclear and missile technology.Successful launchIn Washington, A US defense official told AFP the missile fired on Sunday appeared to be a liquid-fueled KN-17, marking what appeared to be the most successful launch of such a device.\"It's the furthest we've seen one fly,\" the official said, adding that military experts were assessing the missile's re-entry capabilities.But the Pentagon is skeptical whether Pyongyang has mastered the re-entry technology needed to ensure it survives returning into Earth's atmosphere.Sunday's rocket, which Pyongyang dubbed the Hwasong-12, could prove to be a more reliable alternative to the Musudan and marks a significant milestone in its development of an ICBM that could ultimately be tipped with a nuclear warhead, experts said.The launch represented a \"significant success,\" Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, told AFP.North Korea was also under scrutiny by investigators looking for the source of a major cyberattack affecting more than 150 countries, but the European police agency said it was still too early to determine who caused the chaos. (AFP)","746":"North Korea has \"ample technical reason\" to carry out yet another nuclear test as the regime seeks to develop a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can deliver nuclear weapons, a US nuclear scientist said.Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor known for having a first-hand look at North Korea's uranium-enrichment facility during his 2010 visit, also said in an interview with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that it's imperative for President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to develop a unified strategy on the North.(Yonhap)\"North Korea has ample technical reason to test again as it moves toward developing a credible nuclear-tipped ICBM. The test site appears to be ready,\" Hecker said. \"I believe the only thing that inhibits them from testing is the political fallout they would face, particularly from China and the new South Korean administration.\"Hecker said that the North, through five nuclear tests since 2006, is believed to have learned to make nuclear warheads small and light enough to mount on smaller missiles that can reach targets anywhere in South Korea and Japan.He also said the North is estimated to have enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium for 20 to 25 nuclear weapons.\"All estimates are to a large extent based on the observations my Stanford colleagues and I made during my last visit to Yongbyon in November 2010. To my knowledge, no outsiders have been in their nuclear complex since,\" he said. \"The rest of the estimate is based on indirect evidence ? that is, satellite imagery, and what North Korea chooses to publicize, combined with modeling of their capabilities and acquisitions.\"Noting that President Moon favors diplomatic engagement with the North, Hecker said it is imperative for Seoul and Washington to \"craft a unified strategy on North Korea and speak with one voice.\" \"That voice should reflect the new South Korean president's views on finding a diplomatic resolution,\" he said. \"I hope that the Trump administration will support President Moon, and that Pyongyang won't pre-empt diplomacy with a nuclear or long-range missile test.\"Hecker also said he would suggest Trump send an envoy to Pyongyang.\"There is a danger that overconfidence or miscalculation by Kim Jong-un, or an unpredictable reaction to a crisis, could result in a nuclear detonation. I also have serio concerns about a nuclear-weapon accident in North Korea, particularly if Pyongyang feels threatened and begins to deploy its nuclear arsenal,\" he said.

It's America first and the rest of the world last.\" \"But the world I see is also filled with profound opportunities. Our relationships are not zero sum. They should be mutually beneficial,\" Rice said. (Yonhap)","748":"The radar of an advanced US missile defense system in South Korea detected the launch of a North Korean ballistic missile two days ago, South Korea's defense minister told lawmakers on Tuesday. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which became operational earlier this month in South Korea, aims to destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles amid growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea. North Korea test-launched what appears to be a long-range ballistic missile on Sunday, claiming that it can carry a \"large nuclear warhead.\" Defense Minister Han Min-koo said at a meeting of the National Assembly's defense committee that the THAAD's radar in South Korea detected North Korea's launch on Sunday, citing confirmation from the US.Defense Minister Han Min-koo (Yonhap)Han said South Korea's military separately detected the Sunday launch, using its own intelligence assets. The remarks by Han suggested that the South Korean and US militaries closely shared data on the operation of the THAAD in South Korea. Seoul and Washington say the THAAD is defensive in nature and not a threat to Beijing and Moscow.

President Moon ordered the temporary halt of the outdated plants as a step to reduce fine dust.During his campaign, Moon pledged to lower fine dust concentration levels by 30 percent by reducing the nation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels and moving to cleaner energy alternatives.","750":"Former President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday asked a Seoul court to separate her case from her friend's, who is at the center of a corruption scandal that brought Park down from office. During the second preparatory session for her trial at the Seoul Central District Court, Park's legal representatives denied all charges leveled against her and said her case should be reviewed apart from Choi Soon-sil's case.The former president was indicted last month over a string of corruption allegations, including bribery and abuse of power, in many of which she was named as an accomplice to Choi, who has been already standing trial since last year. This file photo shows former President Park Geun-hye entering the Seoul Central District Court on March 30, 2017, to attend a hearing on her arrest warrant. (pool photo) (Yonhap)Prosecutors suspect that Park took or solicited bribes worth 59.2 billion won ($51.9 million) from three local conglomerates -- Samsung, Lotte and SK -- for her or her friend.Park's indictment was delayed as she was immune from prosecution until the Constitutional Court dismissed her as the country's president in a March 10 ruling. \"Merging the two cases is inappropriate as it can prejudice the judges against the defendant,\" attorney Lee Sang-chul said. Her lawyers also pointed to the fact that Choi was indicted by a special prosecutor who was designated to look into the scandal, and Park was charged by state prosecutors. They claimed that the testimonies and evidence provided by the special prosecutor should not be used in Park's trial. Still, it is unclear whether the court will accept Park's request. \"The two defendants' criminal allegations, as well as the list of witnesses, perfectly coincide with each other,\" the presiding Judge Kim Se-yun said during the session. \"If we separate the cases, we need to summon the same witnesses twice.\" Judge Kim also said there were precedents where a case filed by a special prosecutor was merged with a case filed by the prosecution. He said he will further review the request and make a decision. Park was absent from Tuesday's session as her attendance was not mandatory.The first formal hearing is slated for May 23. It will be the first public appearance made by the former leader, who has been jailed since March 31.She is the country's third former president to stand trial over corruption allegations, after Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were convicted in the early 1990s. (Yonhap)","751":"North Korea may be behind the ransomware attacks that disrupted computer systems across the world over the weekend, cyber security experts said Tuesday, suggesting a link between the latest attack and a hacking group associated with Pyongyang. Researchers from two cybersecurity providers, US software company Symantec and the Russian-based Kaspersky Lab, said that some of the code found in the latest \u201cWannaCry\u201d ransomware was nearly identical to code used by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean-run hacking operation. An early version of WannaCry is similar to the code used in a 2015 backdoor created by Lazarus Group, which was implicated in a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and an $81 million heist on a Bangladeshi bank in 2016. The group has allegedly used Bitcoin in their hacking operation.(Yonhap-ESTsecurity)\u201cThis is the best clue we have seen to date as to the origins of WannaCry,\u201d Kaspersky Lab researcher Kurt Baumgartner told Reuters.Choi Sang-myung, security researcher at Seoul-based software firm Hauri, echoed the view, saying the ransomware attack is attributable to North Korea because they have used their own cryptic hacking logics that have never been found in other malware. US-based security researchers, however, stuck a more cautious tone, saying the indication is far from conclusive. The researchers said while they did not rule out North Korea as a suspect, it is too early to confirm the link. Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec, told The New York Times, that all the findings are \u201ca temporal link.\u201d FireEye researcher John Miller told Reuters that the similarities are \u201cnot enough to be strongly suggestive of a common operator.\u201d The connection was first hinted by Google security researcher Neal Mehta, who posted a cryptic tweet containing only a set of characters. They referred to two portions of code in a pair of malware samples, suggesting potential evidence linking North Korea to the ransomware attack. The cyberattack, which has crippled around 300,000 computer systems in more than 150 nations since Friday, came amid international condemnation against North Korea\u2019s test-firing of a new type of ballistic missile on Sunday, which Pyongyang said is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Noting that the attack coincided with North Korea\u2019s missile launch, South Korean security experts suggested that the communist regime might have used the attack as an opportunity to demonstrate their capability to defy international pressure against its nuclear ambitions. \u201cI think there was political motive for North Korea to demonstrate their willingness in time for the establishment of a new government (in South Korea),\u201d said Im Chong-in, professor at Graduate School of Information Security at Seoul-based Korea University. \u201cNorth Korea is quite likely to use ransomware to secure foreign currency.\u201dSecurity Researcher Choi agreed with the idea, saying that North Korea had manufactured ransomware since last August and the cyberattack served as a \u201cperfect opportunity\u201d for the regime to show off their cyber and military capability.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","752":"As part of postelection shake-ups, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea elected a third-term reformist to be its floor leader Tuesday, while the opposition centrist People\u2019s Party welcomed a new chief of its own. Rep. Woo Won-shik beat out Rep. Hong Young-pyo to take the leadership position in a vote by the party\u2019s lawmakers. In his pledge before voting began, he said he would \u201cput forth everything for the success of President Moon Jae-in and the new liberal administration.\u201d\u201cThe key to success lies in how well the ruling and the opposition parties cooperate,\u201d he said.Newly elected Floor Leader Rep. Woo Won-shik (center) of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea is surrounded by journalists after a party meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The new floor leader vowed to set up a \u201c100-day committee\u201d to oversee issues related to people\u2018s livelihoods and attend to the demands of citizens.He was the chief of the party\u2019s labor rights committee dealing with work-related issues involving temporary workers and social discrimination. Woo led the committee since its establishment in 2013 to 2016. In a press briefing after his victory Tuesday, Rep. Woo also stressed the need to maintain close ties with the centrist People\u2019s Party.\u201cThere are many policies and election pledges that came from the People\u2019s Party (in the run-up to the election) that we can work on together. The People\u2019s Party fundamentally shares the same root with our party,\u201d said Rep. Woo, echoing President Moon\u2019s words when Moon met with then-party chief Park Jie-won of the People\u2019s Party. The People\u2019s Party also elected its new floor leader, who is to take on an interim chief role. Rep. Kim Dong-cheol and Rep. Lee Yong-ho were chosen as the floor leader and policy panel chief, respectively. Their tenures will end in May next year. The new floor leader garnered victory in a second primary, racing neck and neck against two other candidates, Rep. You Sung-yop and Rep. Kim Kwan-young.Kim Dong-cheol will help set the direction of the party and lift the gloomy sentiment of the People\u2019s Party after its candidate came in third in this year\u2019s presidential election. Although Rep. Kim expressed openness to cooperation with the ruling Democratic Party, he also added a barbed remark. \u201cThe ruling party seems to be very excited and is following a show-off trail,\u201d he said after his election. \u201cWhen we need cooperation, we will cooperate, but the People\u2019s Party will stand firm to watch over the wrongdoings of the government.\u201dWhen asked about a possible political alliance with the government, Kim insisted such agreements are to be made between parties. \u201cA political alliance does not refer to recruiting individuals from different parties.\u201dAttention is on whether he will be able to lead the People\u2019s Party to act as the \u201ccasting vote\u201d in the National Assembly, as the ruling Democratic Party holds only 120 seats, less than a majority in the 300-seat parliament. The People\u2019s Party holds 40 seats. President Moon Jae-in is planning to meet the floor leaders of the four largest political parties Friday, according to a presidential office worker. Jun Byung-hun, the new president\u2019s chief political aide, will meet the two new floor leaders Wednesday and confirm the meeting with the president.On the same day, the presidential office named Park Soo-hyun its chief spokesman. A former lawmaker and the spokesman for the ruling Democratic Party, he worked with South Chungcheong Province Gov. Ahn Hee-jung in the party\u2019s primary before the presidential election. \u201cI believe a good spokesperson is one who listens well.

We will know them when we see them.\"Earlier Pottinger met with President Moon Jae-in and presidential and foreign ministry officials in Seoul and agreed to hold a summit between Moon and US President Donald Trump in Washington in late June.The thorny issues involving the deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea were also discussed during the meeting, Pottinger said. \"That is a settled matter,\" he said, being asked about the defense system. \"We look forward to continuing the conversation.\"During his presidential campaign, Moon vowed to review the deployment decision made under his predecessor Park Geun-hye. Key elements of the THAAD battery were installed in the host county of Seongju last month and the initial operational capability has been achieved. \"I am happy to report that the status of the alliance is strong. I am fully confident that it's only going to grow stronger between our administrations,\" Pottinger added.Touching on South Korea's recent transition of power following the impeachment of the former President Park, Pottinger said, \"I really feel a sense of awe about what South Korea has achieved over the past couple of decades... South Korea makes democracy look easy.\"I have to say how impressed I am with how smooth the transition is going here. It makes me a little jealous.\"Pottinger arrived in Seoul for a two-day visit on Tuesday to prepare for the first meeting between the South Korean and American leaders.One day after taking office as president, Moon talked to Trump over the phone on Thursday to reaffirm the countries' alliance and close collaboration to denuclearize North Korea. Pottinger was dispatched to Seoul to follow up on the Moon-Trump talks.Moon has said he will continue to seek dialogue with North Korea to resolve the security issues stemming from the North's prohibited nuclear weapons development, a clear departure from the sanctions-only approach under Park toward North Korea.In the latest of its continuous provocations, North Korea test-fired what it claimed a new mid-to-long-range ballistic missile that can carry a large nuclear warhead on Sunday.

(Yonhap)\"There's a possibility of various strategic and tactical provocations in case of the strengthening of international pressure,\" the ministry said during the session convened to discuss the North's latest provocation. \"North Korea maintains conditions to carry out a nuclear test in Punggye-ri on a standing basis.\"It was referring to a nuclear test site in the northeastern mountainous region where the North conducted its five previous nuclear tests, including two last year.The Hwasong-12 rocket landed in waters 787 kilometers away after reaching a maximum altitude of 2,111.5 km, according to Pyongyang's state media.The ministry confirmed the announcement, saying it is estimated to have flown 4,500-5,000 km if fired on a standard angle. The missile launch at around 5:27 a.m. on Sunday was detected by South Korean Navy's Aegis destroyer, Yulgok Yi I, two minutes later.It's viewed as an intermediate-range ballistic missile, the ministry said, adding additional analysis is needed to check if the North has secured a \"stable\" missile technology for atmospheric re-entry. The North seems to be trying to develop a new delivery means for its nuclear weapons after a series of failed missile launches, the ministry said.It is also apparently seeking to test the new government of South Korea in a bid to take the initiative in inter-Korean relations, it said.The North test-fired 10 ballistic missiles this year alone.

The team consists of five divisions in charge of policy, personal vetting, political affairs, publicity and administrative affairs.\u00a0 Interpretations have varied as to whether the prime minister can only exercise the right to recommend ministers to the president.Some observers say that Yoo Il-ho, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs who currently serves as acting prime minister, should be allowed to exercise the minister recommendation authority, while others say the method is not in line with the law.Moon's Democratic Party once pushed for a legal revision to allow the prime minister-nominee to exercise the recommendation authority, but the move failed as critics argued that it runs counter to the Constitution.

In South Korea in 2015, a bank opened to help modern-day Jean Valjeans, poor petty offenders who go to jail because they can\u2019t afford to pay a few million won in fines and penalties. \u201cAs long as their offenses are not grave, we consider lending,\u201d Oh Chang-ik, head of the Jean Valjean Bank said during an interview with The Korea Herald.\u00a0 Oh Chang-ik, head of Jean Valjean Bank poses in an interview with The Korea Herald. (Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea Herald)Every year, approximately 40,000 small-time offenders go to jail and endure prison labor because of their failure to pay penalties, he explained. Since its inception two years ago, the microcredit scheme has offered some 460 minor criminals loans totaling 8 billion won ($7 million). Of them, 66 debtors have fully paid off their loans, while 241 others are in the process of doing so, as of this week, according to Oh. The bank provides up to 3 million won per person, with no interest and no collateral. Debtors are asked to repay six months to a year later. All it asks for is a written statement of why they need the money and a copy of the applicant\u2019s family registration document via email or mail. Of course, it has its own screening standards. \u201cWe look at how much they need the money and their family situation, for example whether the applicant is a single mother with young children,\u201d said Oh who doubles as the secretary-general of Citizens\u2019 Solidarity for Human Rights, which initiated this project in February 2015. \u201cWe do not give out loans to offenders of sexual crimes or those caught for drunk driving. The money is for offenders of a crime that did little social harm,\u201d he said. Those who committed heinous crimes such as murder and robbery, economic crimes like bribery and embezzlement and habitual offenders are also ruled out. Oh said the bank receives approximately 180 applications monthly. Priority is given to teenagers living by themselves, young heads of the family, recipients of the basic livelihood security benefits and people living just above the poverty line.\u201cPersonally, I want to help young offenders in poverty so that they don\u2019t have to spend time behind bars,\u201d he said.The microcredit bank started with just 10 million won from Citizens\u2019 Solidarity for Human Rights. Relying entirely on donations, Oh had some concerns in the beginning that the bank may run out of funds, if donations fall short or loan defaults rise. \u201cBut thankfully, that has not happened,\u201d Oh said. Quite to the opposite, its loan pot has grown to 800 million won at this moment, as donations grew and many debtors paid off in full. Nearly 4,300 individuals and groups have made contributions. Among them are some former debtors. \u201cInterestingly and gratefully, some people, a few years after they received our loans, sent us their donations from 10,000-20,000 won,\u201d Oh said.Oh\u2019s ultimate dream is that one day Jean Valjean Bank is not needed anymore. \u201cIf no one goes to prison because of poverty, our bank will have no work to do. I hope that day will come,\u201d he said.The activist also said that the government has a key role to play. Under the current law, one who is sentenced to a financial penalty must make the full payment in 30 days. \u201cI believe the current disciplinary provision has a lot to improve. Making criminals do labor in prison just because they cannot afford to pay fines is meaningless and gives them unnecessary pain.\u201d Quoting Article 11 of the Constitution that all citizens are equal before the law, Oh stressed that the system is unfair for poor offenders. Rich offenders walk free, while poor ones go to jail to make up for the financial penalty which is set regardless of one\u2018s income level. \u201cIn our society, income inequality is leading to unequal punishment.\u201dBy Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","765":"A Seoul court said Friday it has ordered former President Park Geun-hye to appear as a witness at a trial of her aide in connection with a corruption scandal that removed her from office.The Seoul Central District Court said she will be questioned at the trial of Lee Young-seon on May 19 at the request of special prosecutors.\u00a0 (Yonhap)It is yet unclear whether Park will appear at the hearing.

Yes, that's called war, if they shoot at us.\"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (Yonhap)He made clear that if the North shoots at the US, then it's \"game on.\"\"We'll take it out,\" Mattis said.If the missiles land in waters short of Guam, the decision will be left to President Donald Trump, he added. Trump, in turn, would consult with America's allies.In unusually strong rhetoric last week, Trump said the North would experience \"fire and fury\" if it continued to threaten the United States. He later added that the US military is \"locked and loaded\" to respond to its provocations.Mattis initially declined to comment on how the US would react to a North Korean missile attack, saying the president had made it clear.Guam, he said, is well protected. The island is home to some7,000 American military personnel and some strategic assets including bombers and a THAAD missile defense battery.Last week, the secretary warned the North to \"cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people.\"But he has also emphasized the need to diplomatically resolve the standoff with the recalcitrant state.In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Trump administration will aim to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula through diplomatic and economic pressure.\"While diplomacy is our preferred means of changing North Korea's course of action, it is backed by military options,\" they said.

New wine must be put into fresh wineskins,\u201d were Lee\u2019s words upon inauguration last year, which some cited as reason for his resignation.But to this, Lee explained that his previous words should be read within the given context back then.His intention was to resign in February 2018 -- when former President Park\u2019s term would have ended, if not for her abrupt ouster -- without making it to the end of his two-year term in August so as not to stay in office after his retirement age, according to the police chief.Despite his reasoning, however, his plan to stay triggered some backlashes as it apparently ran counter to the new president\u2019s move to refresh and reform the government organization.Lee is largely considered a pro-Park figure, having served as presidential secretary for social security under the former president in 2014-2015.(tellme@heraldcorp.com)","772":"North Korea said Tuesday that leader Kim Jong Un was briefed on his military\u2019s plans to launch missiles into waters near Guam as part of an effort to create \u201cenveloping fire\u201d near the US military hub in the Pacific.The comments, while typically belligerent, are significant because they appeared to signal a path to defuse a deepening crisis with Washington over a weapons program that is seen as having the ability to be able to send a nuclear missile to the US mainland.During an inspection of the army\u2019s Strategic Forces, Kim praised the military for drawing up a \u201cclose and careful plan\u201d and said he would watch the \u201cfoolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees\u201d a little more before deciding whether to give an order for the missile test, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said. In the May 2, 2017 file photo, a TV screen shows images of US President Donald Trump, left, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea. Tensions between the United States and North Korea tend to flare up suddenly and then fade away almost as quickly, but the latest escalation won`t likely go away quite so easily.(AP)Kim said North Korea will conduct the planned missile launches if the \u201cYankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity\u201d and that the United States should \u201cthink reasonably and judge property\u201d to avoid shame, the news agency said.Lobbing missiles toward Guam would be a deeply provocative act from the US perspective. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United Sates would take out any such missile seen to be heading for American soil and declared any such North Korean attack could lead to war.Kim\u2019s comments, however, with their conditional tone, seemed to hold out the possibility that friction could ease if the United States made some sort of gesture that Pyongyang considered a move to back away from previous \u201cextremely dangerous reckless actions.\u201dThe United States and South Korea plan next week, however, to start annual defensive military drills that the North claims are preparation for invasion.On Monday, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford held a series of meetings with senior South Korean military and political officials and the local media. He also made comments that appeared to be an attempt to ease anxiety over tit-for-tat threats between President Donald Trump and North Korea while also showing a willingness to back up Trump\u2019s warnings if need be.Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States wants to peacefully resolve tensions with North Korea. But Washington is also ready to use the \u201cfull range\u201d of its military capabilities in case of provocation, Dunford said. Joint Chief Chairman Gen.

The liquid-fuel missile is designed to be fired from road mobile launchers and has been previously described by North Korea as built for attacking Alaska and Hawaii.The North followed the May launch with two flight tests of its Hwasong-14 ICBM last month. Analysts said that a wide swath of the continental United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, could be within reach of those missiles, once perfected.The latest Korea Central News Agency report said Kim ordered his military to be prepared to launch the missiles toward Guam at any time. If the \u201cplanned fire of power demonstration\u201d is carried out because of US recklessness, Kim said it will be \u201cthe most delightful historic moment when the Hwasong artillerymen will wring the windpipes of the Yankees and point daggers at their necks,\u201d the news agency reported.North Korea is angry about new United Nations sanctions over its expanding nuclear weapons and missile program and annual military drills between Washington and Seoul beginning later this month that Pyongyang condemns as invasion rehearsals.Kim said that the United States must \u201cmake a proper option first and show it through action, as it committed provocations after introducing huge nuclear strategic equipment into the vicinity of the peninsula\u201d and that it \u201cshould stop at once arrogant provocations\u201d against North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency said.Trump has declared the US military \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and said he was ready to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.South Korean President Moon on Monday called for a peaceful solution to the nuclear standoff, saying that \u201cthere must not be another war on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d according to his office.In a meeting with top aides at the presidential Blue House, Moon said South Korea would work to safeguard peace on the peninsula in cooperation with the United States and other countries.

But the report came at a delicate time when liberal politician Moon Jae-in was elected as South Korea's new president early Wednesday.The Ministry of Unification said that it would be foolish if North Korea carries out another nuclear test at this juncture.\"Moon earlier warned that if North Korea conducts an additional nuclear test, everything including inter-Korean dialogue will not proceed,\" Lee Duk-haeng, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.On the campaign trail, Moon vowed to seek a dual-track approach of pushing denuclearization and dialogue with Pyongyang.He earlier raised the need to resume the now-suspended joint industrial complex and a tour project at Mount Kumgang on the North's east coast, but he later struck a cautious note over hasty resumptions of the two projects.\"If North Korea comes to talks for denuclearization after freezing its nukes, we would be able to resume the Kaesong complex and the tour program,\" Moon told a forum in late April.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year alone following those in 2006, 2009 and 2013, in defiance of international condemnation.

(Yonhap)Lee, who has been detained since February, was found guilty of all five charges -- bribery, embezzlement, concealment of criminal proceeds, illegal transfer of assets overseas and perjury.The court said Lee and Samsung executives offered large bribes to the president, who held \u201cimmense power and the ultimate authority,\u201d and embezzled company funds, hid assets overseas and concealed profits from criminal acts in the process, all expecting a favor in the form of Samsung Group\u2019s smooth leadership transition. Lee is the first member of Samsung Group\u2019s ownership family to be sentenced to jail. He is set to appeal the decision. The special counsel claimed Samsung had offered 43.3 billion won ($38.3 million) in donations to three entities controlled by Choi and in sports sponsorships to Choi\u2019s horse-riding daughter Chung Yoo-ra. It saw the money as a bribe to win the government\u2019s backing for a controversial 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates -- Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T; -- which was a crucial step for a smooth leadership transition from the ailing Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. The merger was opposed by many shareholders who viewed it as only serving to help Lee tighten his grip. Former President Park, in return for the money, is suspected of having pressured the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, to vote in favor of the controversial merger, according to the counsel. Prosecutors sought a 12-year jail sentence for Lee. But the court acknowledged only part of the amount -- 1.6 billion won provided to a winter sports foundation and 7.3 billion won for Chung\u2019s equestrian training -- as bribes. Donations worth 22 billion won to the K-Sports Foundation and Mir Foundation \u2013 to which other local firms also contributed money -- were not in return for favors, it said. The court said Lee had been closely involved in making the money-for-political favors deal with the then-president. But it said Lee \u201cpassively\u201d accepted Park\u2019s requests for donations, rather than actively seeking favors. Four former and incumbent Samsung Group executives, who stood trial along with Lee, were also jailed.Choi Gee-sung, the former head of Samsung Group\u2019s now-defunct control tower Corporate Strategy Office, and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were sentenced to four years in prison for their \u201cheavy\u201d involvement in implementing the bribery scheme. But they were not direct beneficiaries from it, the court said. Former Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin received a three-year jail term, suspended for five years, and former Executive Vice President Hwang Sung-soo was sentenced to 2 1\/2 years, suspended for four years.Lee was immediately taken to the Seoul Detention Center,\u00a0 south of Seoul, where he has already served nearly six months. Choi and Chang, who had been on trial without detention, will be taken behind bars. \u201cWe cannot accept the verdict,\u201d Lee\u2019s lawyer Song Woo-chul told reporters following the ruling. \u201cIn the appeal, we are certain to have all charges proven not guilty.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Handcuffed and bound with rope around his black suit, Lee stepped out of the Justice Ministry\u2019s bus at around 1:36 p.m. to hear his verdict at courtroom No. 417. As the verdict was delivered, he showed no particular reaction. The courtroom is the same where his father Lee Kun-hee received a suspended jail term for bribery and tax evasion in 2008. Reflecting public interest, the room was filled with the accused\u2019s family members, lawyers and reporters, as well as spectators. More than 450 people applied for just 30 seats in the 150-seat courtroom to witness what has been dubbed Korea\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d Lee denied all charges, saying the donations were made without his knowledge. He also said all key decisions from the controversial merger to the donations to the Choi-controlled entities had been signed off on by his mentor, former Samsung Group Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung. Samsung did not deny donating money to the Choi-controlled foundations, but the four executives said they had been forced to donate out of fear of what Park and Choi could do to their business.The ruling is likely to deal a heavy blow to former President Park and her friend Choi, who are at the center of the corruption scandal that drove millions of Koreans into the streets last winter and eventually removed Park from office. They are on trial over charges of receiving bribes from local firms, including Samsung, with a ruling expected in October. The court said Park and Choi had a close relationship and the ex-president helped Choi pursue personal interests through the bribery scheme involving Samsung Group. \u201cThe ex-president conspired with Choi to actively and specifically ask for financial support through three one-one-one meetings from 2014 to 2016, and Lee met the demands in anticipation of Park\u2019s help in the company\u2019s leadership transfer,\u201d the court said. The ruling on Samsung\u2019s heir apparent is widely seen as a sign of growing intolerance toward decadeslong corrupt ties between politicians and family-run conglomerates, or chaebol.There had been pressure on the court to convict Lee, amid public anger in the face of the corruption scandal, which people believe symbolizes an unfair and unjust society that only benefits the most powerful in the country. Chaebol owners have long gotten away with light or suspended sentences, with courts citing their contributions to the nation\u2019s economy. Lee\u2019s father also had his terms suspended and was set free through a presidential pardon.\u00a0About 800 riot police were deployed around the court to prevent possible clashes between protesters present both in favor and against Lee\u2019s verdict. They were gathering to either call for a heavier punishment or his release from prison.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","781":"South Korea's new labor minister promised Monday to improve working conditions and treatment for non-regular workers by removing discriminative measures and setting up fair principles in the employment system. \"The ministry will work to minimize non-regular jobs that are insecure and make sure the positions in the public sector that deal with the safety of our people are full-time based,\" Minister of Employment and Labor Kim Young-joo said in an inauguration speech released by the ministry.

The ratio increased to 21 percent of all votes cast in the National Assembly elections held last year, according to the NEC.Over 42.4 million people are eligible to cast ballots in the upcoming election, marking the largest number of voters in the country's history, the NEC noted earlier.NEC officials and local observers believe the early voting system may help raise the overall turnout by about 4 percentage points, citing a similar number of people who failed to cast their ballots in previous presidential elections but said they would have done so had they been allowed to vote in advance.The last presidential election held in 2012 had a voter turnout rate of 75.8 percent, following 63 percent five years earlier.Many believe the upcoming election may see a high turnout rate of around or over 80 percent, helped by the first-ever early voting and a two-hour extension in voting hours on election day slated for Tuesday.The upcoming election marks a rare presidential by-election caused by the March 10 ouster of former President Park Geun-hye over corruption allegations that have also led to her arrest and formal indictment.Voting hours in by-elections are extended by two hours to 8 p.m. to allow those unable to take the day off to vote after getting off work.But unlike local and assembly by-elections that elect replacements who only serve the remainder of their predecessors' terms, the presidential by-election will only mean an early election to fill the now vacant top executive office with the single five-year term of the next chief executive starting immediately following his or her election. Dozens of people stand in lines at Seoul's Incheon International Airport on May 4, 2017 to cast their ballots in early voting for the upcoming presidential election before embarking on trips over the three-day Children's Day weekend. (Yonhap)To help further boost voter turnout, the election commission said it has also set up polling booths at major ports, including the Incheon International Airport and Seoul's major train stations, in anticipation of people going away on trips over the three-day weekend created by Children's Day that falls on Friday.Absentee voting for people with disabilities and those away from the country aboard ships has been held since Monday and was set to end later Thursday. A six-day voting period for voters staying overseas was held late last month.All votes cast in advance will be kept sealed with those locked overseas to be brought here for official counting following the end of the presidential election on Tuesday, the NEC has said.The election watchdog is also seeking to boost the turnout rate of Internet-savvy voters, allowing online posts of photographs confirming their participation in the election for the first time.Previously, posting such photos had been prohibited out of concern over possible election law violations. The NEC said pictures showing actual ballot papers will continue to be banned, along with pictures of other people at polling stations with possible publicity issues.\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, 13 hopefuls are vying for the presidential office after two candidates dropped out of the race.The latest poll on the presidential election published Wednesday showed Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party in the lead with 42.4 percent, followed by two runner-ups -- Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party and Hong Joon-pyo of the former ruling Liberty Korea Party -- who were tied at 18.6 percent.The other major candidates included Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party, who in the latest poll stood in fourth place with 7.3 percent, and Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party with 4.9 percent. (Yonhap)","794":"The state election watchdog said Wednesday it has launched an investigation into possible election law violations surrounding a news report that appeared to slander presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in.On Tuesday, private broadcaster SBS reported that Moon of the liberal Democratic Party was behind the delay in the salvaging of the ferry Sewol, which sank off the southwestern coast in April 2014, killing more than 300 people aboard. This image shows Moon Jae-in (left), presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, and Hong Joon-pyo, presidential candidate of the Liberty Korea Party, with the salvaged ferry Sewol in the backdrop. (Yonhap)Citing an official of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the broadcaster said the ministry delayed the operations to win favors from Moon in terms of expanding its staff number and affiliated organizations.The National Election Commission has asked SBS officials about the allegations and the ministry official whose identity was withheld in the report, a commission official said.The investigation is aimed at determining whether the broadcaster or the official violated election laws by disclosing false information to prevent the election of a particular candidate.South Korea is to pick a new president next Tuesday, with Moon leading polls by a wide margin. In the latest opinion surveys published Wednesday, the former human rights lawyer beat his closest competitor Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party with support of about 40 percent against some 20 percent.His campaign has lodged a strong complaint with SBS, saying the report is \"fake news.\" The broadcaster deleted the report from the Internet and later issued an apology, claiming it had no intention of affecting the election or slandering a particular candidate.It also claimed the report was deleted to stop the allegations from spreading, not due to external pressure.Other presidential contenders, however, demanded the truth.\"This is not time to delete the truth but to reveal it, and apologize before our children,\" Park Jie-won, chief of the People's Party, said on Facebook, referring to the 250 high school students who died in the sinking. \"Don't burn your own soul in the desire for power.\"Park also accused Moon's campaign of strong-arming the media.Meanwhile, the campaign of Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party demanded Moon immediately quit the race if the allegations are true. (Yonhap)","795":"The first-ever early voting in a presidential election will begin Thursday, ahead of the main vote Tuesday. This is the first time early voting, in which voters can use any polling station, is being provided in a presidential election. According to the National Election Commission, there are 3,507 advance polling stations across the country, including Seoul Station, Yongsan Station and Incheon Airport.\u00a0 National Election Commission officals install advance polling facilities in a community center in Sejong on Wednesday. (Yonhap)With a significant number of voters expected to cast their ballots early, presidential candidates encouraged voter engagement Wednesday. \u201cDemocracy lives on votes. The votes are the meals of democracy. Only voting can change the world and fix injustice and unfairness,\u201d Democratic Party of Korea candidate Moon Jae-in said in a press briefing at the party\u2019s headquarter in Yeouido, central Seoul. He also pledged to do a \u201cfree hug\u201d event in Seoul if the advance voting turnout reaches over 25 percent. The other four mainstream candidates also launched campaigns for early voting as to gear up for the final stretch.The conservative Liberty Korea Party started a campaign it dubbed \u201cAdvance voting for Hong Joon-pyo,\u201d offering early voters a chance to visit the presidential office if Hong is elected. The centrist People\u2019s Party, conservative splinter Bareun Party and progressive minor Justice Party have also started similar campaigns. Voters are allowed to take photographs after voting and can express who they have voted for. They cannot, however, photograph the ballot.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)","796":"TOGANE, Japan -- Korean conscripts of the Japanese Imperial Army who were stricken with mental illness during World War II suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to copies of Japanese hospital-kept clinical records obtained Monday by Yonhap News Agency.Asai Hospital in the city of Togane, Japan's Chiba Prefecture, has kept clinical records on about 8,000 former soldiers who developed mental illness on Japan's battlefields in the Pacific War, including about 100 former conscripts who hailed from the Korean Peninsula. Before and during the war, Japan placed the peninsula under its colonial rule from 1910-45 and forced many Korean people to fight for the country.Located about a 2 1\/2 hour drive from Tokyo, the hospital specialized in the treatment of mental illness has kept stacks of the records in a warehouse on its grounds.\u00a0Toshio Asai, the deceased former chief of the hospital, had them in his custody after working as a psychiatrist at the Japanese Army's Konodai Hospital in the city of Ichikawa, Chiba, that was designated as a military medical facility for soldiers hit by mental illness. This photo, taken on Aug. 14, 2017, shows a book of copies of the medical records of soldiers hit by mental illness during World War II at Asai Hospital in the city of Togane in Japan`s Chiba Prefecture. (Yonhap)Asai had hidden the records, a collection of 1,000 books classified by the years when the patients were evacuated to be treated for illness, defying an Army order to have them burned following Japan's defeat in the war.According to the copies, the agony of a Korean conscript surnamed Kim suffering mental illness included a description of the extent of the war's terrible situation and his unwanted participation in the conflict inflicted on him.Born in 1924, the native of Gyeonggi Province near Seoul was conscripted in April 1945 before being diagnosed with a case of mental illness in October the same year. \"He got up all of a sudden at night and began to cry, saying 'Aigo,' and sometimes he beat his head with both of his hands,\" the records said.Kim also went on the rampage and broke panes of glass in a bathroom before the hospital took measures to restrain him.Even though the war ended in 1945, his illness continued to plague him until he died at the hospital in 2000 at the age of 76.Hiroshi Shimizu, an 81-year-old honorary professor at Japan's Saitama University who carried out research on the clinical records along with Asai, has delivered the records of Kim's case to his younger brother living in South Korea.Learning about Kim's death four years later, the younger brother contacted Shimizu for the medical records on Kim.\"His mother passed away without knowing about his son's fate,\"Shimizu said, adding that he sent Kim's bereaved family a report based on his sickbed records.Shimizu lamented, \"I can't imagine how miserable the family members were when they read the report.\" (Yonhap)","797":"A lawmaker of the conservative Bareun Party said Wednesday that he has withdrawn his earlier decision to leave the party along with a dozen of his colleagues in support of the presidential candidate of a rival party.Rep. Hwang Young-cheul told reporters that he has decided to stay in the party, an about-face from his announcement Tuesday to defect, along with 12 other party members, expressing support for Hong Joon-pyo, a major presidential candidate of the conservative Liberty Korea Party. Rep. Hwang Young-cheul (Yonhap)\"After the announcement, I had to go through much thinking and agony,\" Hwang said at the National Assembly. \"I have received a great deal of messages full of criticism and disappointment from the people who gave me much support and encouragement. I felt really sorry to them.\"The Bareun Party is a spinoff from the former ruling Saenuri Party, the predecessor of the Liberty Korea Party. The separation came as the Bareun Party supported the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye over a massive corruption scandal.The lawmakers' departure is aimed at raising the chances of a conservative presidential candidate winning the election scheduled for Tuesday next week over current front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party.It was also apparently motivated by the lackluster support rating for the Bareun Party's presidential candidate Yoo Seong-min.Hong, meanwhile, has seen his support rate rise sharply in recent weeks after appealing to the pro-Park and conservative base.With Hwang's withdrawal, the Bareun Party controls 20 seats, maintaining its negotiating bloc status in parliament.But at least one lawmaker has already expressed his intention to leave the party in the coming days.While Hong has welcomed the defections, some members of the former ruling party have chastised the lawmakers for trying to return to a party they initially abandoned.Aside from Hwang, one or two more lawmakers could also reverse their decisions, according to a party official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. (Yonhap)","798":"US has expressed no desire to alter the terms of an agreement with South Korea to deploy the THAAD missile defense system, a senior South Korean official said Tuesday, following a dust-up over who should pay for the $1 billion system.US President Donald Trump sparked a firestorm in South Korea with his repeated demand that Seoul pay for a THAAD unit installed in the country to bolster defenses against North Korea. The demand runs counter to an agreement under which\u00a0US pays for the system while the South hosts it and provides land.\u00a0(Yonhap)The office of South Korea's national security adviser said after a phone call with US National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster that US promised to abide by the existing agreement, but McMaster later gave a different account, saying that what he said during the call was that the US will stick to the agreement \"until any renegotiation.\"\"It is true that there has been no desire (expressed) or consultations (between the two countries) to change the existing agreement,\" a senior South Korean official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. \"The same is with FTA,\" the official said.The remark means that\u00a0US has not expressed its desire to renegotiate the free trade agreement with South Korea despite Trump's assertion that he would renegotiate or terminate the deal. Trump made the remark in an interview with Reuters last week, denouncing what has been touted as an economic alliance between the two countries as \"horrible.\" (Yonhap)","799":"US\u00a0should be careful about holding negotiations with North Korea, former US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Tuesday, after President Donald Trump said he would be \"honored\" to meet with the North's leader under the right circumstances.\"The North Koreans are always interested, not just Kim Jong-un but his father before him, were always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position.

(Yonhap)","800":"North Korea is trying to use its nuclear weapons as an \"instrument of blackmail\" to force the US to leave South Korea so as to realize \"coercive reunification\" of the divided peninsula, a senior White House official said Tuesday.Matt Pottinger, senior Asian affairs director at the National Security Council, also said during a security forum that the US has now been left with no other choice but to ramp up pressure on the communist nation to move it toward denuclearization.\u00a0(Yonhap)\"They have made no secret in conversations they've had with former American officials, for example, and others that they want to use these weapons as an instrument of blackmail to achieve other goals, even including perhaps the coercive reunification of the Korean peninsula one day, after they then attempt to coerce the US to leave the peninsula and to abandon our alliances,\" Pottinger said.\"It's also no secret that North Korea has proliferated just about every weapons system that they've ever created... We really have no choice but to increase pressure on North Korea, diplomatically isolate them, to bring greater economic pain to bear until they are willing to make concrete steps to start reducing that threat,\" he said during the Sasakawa Peace Foundation forum.Pottinger said, however, that US policy is not to seek regime change. \"Our policy is not one seeking regime change,\" Pottinger said.\"Our ultimate goal is to achieve denuclearization of the peninsula. That's the goal China shares with us. It's certainly the goal that our closest allies, including Korea and Japan, share with us.\" (Yonhap)","801":"Heavyweight US Republican senators and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillery Clinton expressed concern Tuesday after President Donald Trump said he would be \"honored\" to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Trump made the remark in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, arguing that he would \"absolutely\" be willing to meet with Kim if such a meeting takes place \"under the right circumstances.\"The use of the word \"honored\" toward the autocratic leader raised eyebrows.

In media interviews last week, Trump praised Kim, and even called him a \"pretty smart cookie,\" for taking over power from his father at a young age while dealing with \"very tough people\" trying to take power away from him, including his uncle, whom Kim executed.McCain said that US Republicans have always stood up for human rights and against dictatorships.\"This is a dramatic departure from the kind of approach to foreign policy and human rights that I admired Ronald Reagan so much for. And I think one of the reasons why he was one of the most successful presidents in history,\" he said. \"it's very disturbing.It's disturbing because we are proud Republicans and we stand for human rights.\"Trump also came under fire for his \"very friendly\" phone call Saturday with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.\"I wish that the president would consider much more carefully his comments, particularly in praise of a North Korean.

Under local regulations, the results of polls conducted from six days prior to the voting day cannot be published over concerns that opinion polls may \u201cimpede fairness and affect the election results.\u201d However, polls can be conducted during the six-day period, provided that results are not published and the National Election Commission has been informed beforehand. Violators are subject to up to two years in jail or fines of 4 million won ($3,500).Five leading candidates for the May 9 presidential election attend a joint debate forum at a TV station in Seoul on April 28, 2017. (Yonhap)With the poll results closed and early voting taking place for two days from Thursday, the candidates are gearing up for the last stretch. All of the five candidates cut electioneering to a minimum Tuesday to prepare for the last live TV presidential candidate debate hosted by the national election body later in the evening. Front-runner Moon, who is leading the race, is seeking to cement his victory. He topped the list of party-backed contenders with 42.6 percent of support in the latest poll by Realmeter on Sunday.Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party took 20.9 percent of support, while conservative Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party chased him in a tight race with 16.7 percent. With conservative voters appearing to be rallying behind him, Hong seeks to become the main rival to the leading candidate Moon.On Tuesday, 13 lawmakers from the conservative Bareun Party declared their support for Hong, opting to back the Liberty Korea Party candidate over their own Yoo Seong-min. Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party posted support of 7.6 percent and Yoo came in last with 5.2 percent. While political pundits say it is difficult to be certain of the results, the final polls of previous elections show that it is not easy for a runner-up candidate to turn the game around. The last poll for the 2012 presidential election by Gallup showed former President Park Geun-hye garnering 47 percent of support, while liberal candidate Moon took 42 percent. The final results showed that Park won the race with 51 percent of votes, while Moon had 48 percent. In 2007, former President Lee Myung-bak stood at 45 percent of support against Chung Dong-young with 18 percent. The actual turnout mirrored the poll, with Lee garnering 49 percent of votes and Chung taking 26 percent.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)","803":"South Korea did not have any prior knowledge that the US might charge it for the deployment of a new missile shield, Cheong Wa Dae said Tuesday, as controversy escalated here over US President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise remark last week about possibly billing Korea $1 billion for the system, which the allies said is now \u201coperational\u201d with \u201cinitial capability.\u201d The presidential office\u2019s clarification came in response to a local report that claimed that a transition team for then President-elect Trump had sent a document to Seoul in December to propose bilateral talks over the cost of deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here.The Ministry of National Defense, in a separate press meeting, called the report \u201cbaseless.\u201dSouth Korean Defense Ministry's spokesman Moon Sang-gyun (Yonhap)\u201cThe report is simply not true,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesperson Moon Sang-kyun said. \u201cI have confirmed it myself after speaking to the minister (about the issue).

Citing an unidentified government source, local daily Hankook Ilbo earlier reported that Cheong Wa Dae had received a request from Trump\u2019s transition team in December to pay for the cost of stationing the battery for THAAD.Despite the request, Cheong Wa Dae had proceeded with the deployment of THAAD, sending its security chief Kim to the US, where he met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn in January and with the current adviser H.R. McMaster in March, the report added Noting that Kim visited the US during former President Park Geun-hye\u2019s suspension from power upon her parliamentary impeachment last December, the report claimed Kim felt compelled to complete the THAAD deployment before the May 9 election, resulting in Washington demanding financial burden from Seoul in return. The report came amid growing pushback in South Korea against the THAAD deployment as the Trump administration has increased pressure against Seoul to pay for the platform, hinting at a renegotiation of a bilateral deal. \u201cWe should not decide whether to deploy THHAD right now.

The device, obtained by a local TV channel, contained documents related to state affairs, some of which the prosecution concluded were official secrets.Lee Jae-yong, de facto leader of the nation's largest business group Samsung, was also arrested on charges of providing or pledging 43.3 billion won to Choi and, in effect, Park, in return for her help in securing group control through a merger of two key units.Park is the country's third former president to stand trial over corruption allegations, after Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were convicted in the early 1990s.The court is expected to hold two or three more preliminary hearings before opening the first formal hearing around June.\u00a0(Yonhap)","807":"WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump said Monday he would be \"honored\" to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un if such a meeting takes place \"under the right circumstances,\" the first time Trump has expressed his willingness to meet with Kim since taking office.\"If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,\" Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \"If it's under the, again, under the right circumstances.

That possibility is not there at this time.\"It was the first time that Trump has expressed his willingness to meet with the North's autocratic leader, though he said during last year's campaigning that he would \"accept\" the North's leader to the White House and hold nuclear negotiations with him while eating a \"hamburger.\"Trump's latest remark suggests that the US and the North could ultimately be headed toward negotiations, even though the sides have rattled sabers, flexed muscles against each other and traded belligerent rhetoric warning of war over the past weeks and months.Last week, the Trump administration also hinted it's considering dialogue. While unveiling its North Korea policy, the administration said it would ramp up pressure on Pyongyang \"through economic sanctions and diplomatic measures\" while remaining open to negotiations.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in an interview with NPR the following day that the US is willing to hold \"direct talks\" with the North if the communist regime is ready to hold negotiations about the \"right agenda\" of ending its nuclear program.In recent days, Trump has made a series of positive comments about the North's leader. In an interview with the Washington Times Friday, Trump called the North's leader a \"pretty smart cookie,\" saying Kim took over power from his father at a young age while dealing with \"very tough people\" trying to take power away from him, including his uncle that Kim executed.Trump made a similar remark in an interview with Reuters the previous day, saying it would not have been easy for Kim to take over the North at a young age.During campaigning, Trump repeatedly stressed he's an excellent negotiator and is ready to use the skill to regain American interests lost under Democratic administrations. It was believed in that context that he expressed his willingness to meet with the North's leader. Trump first expressed the willingness in May last year, drawing criticism not only from critics, but also from his own party that such a meeting would end up bolstering the dictator. He didn't back down, however, saying the following month that he would \"accept him\" if the North's leader visits the US.\"Who the hell cares? I'll talk to anybody,\" Trump said at the time.Trump also said at the time he will only \"make a good deal\" if he were to hold talks with the North's leader, and that there's a\"10 percent or 20 percent chance\" he could talk Kim out of developing nuclear weapons.Meanwhile, Trump has expressed concerns about the North's threats.In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Trump said the North \"weighs on me.\"\"But we have to be prepared for the worst,\" he said. \"We have to be prepared to do what we have to do. We cannot allow this to go on.\"Trump also said in an interview with Fox News set to be aired later in the day that nobody is safe.\"Nobody's safe. I mean, who's safe? The guy's got nuclear weapons,\" Trump said, according to Fox News. \"I'd like to say they're very safe. These are great brave solders, these are great brave troops and they know the situation. We have 28,000 troops on the line and they're right there. And so nobody's safe. We're probably not safe over here.\"If the North's leader \"gets the long-range missiles, we're not safe either,\" Trump said. (Yonhap)","808":"North Korea pledged Monday to bolster its nuclear weapons program at maximum speed, issuing the country's first official response to the recently released North Korea policy by the US administration, which focuses on \"maximum pressure and engagement.\"\"Now that the US is kicking up the overall racket for sanctions and pressure against the DPRK, pursuant to its new DPRK policy called 'maximum pressure and engagement', the DPRK will speed up at the maximum pace the measure for bolstering its nuclear deterrence,\" a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement.DPRK is the abbreviation of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. (Yonhap)\"The DPRK's measures for bolstering the nuclear force to the maximum will be taken in a consecutive and successive way at any moment and any place decided by its supreme leadership,\" according to the statement, carried by the state news wire Korean Central News Agency.The North has long justified its nuclear weapons development as a deterrence against what it calls US hostility, and the recent pledges mean it will continue its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The North had been widely speculated to conduct a nuclear test in April, during which two of the country's key national events fall -- the birthday of North Korean founder Kim Il-sung and the anniversary of the formation of its military.As the speculation sparked security jitters, the US has sent a strike group led by aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and nuclear-powered submarine USS Michigan to waters off the Korean Peninsula.The Trump administration also unveiled its North Korea policy line last month, which vowed to step up sanctions and engagement to get the North to give up its nuclear program. In the statement, the North accused the US of escalating tensions on the peninsula with the naval deployment and military threats.\"The US aggression hysteria has never reached such a height and the situation on the Korean Peninsula has never inched close to the brink of nuclear war as in the period of the recent drills,\" according to the KCNA.\"The DPRK is fully ready to respond to any option taken by the US ... (it) will continue to bolster its military capabilities for self-defense and preemptive nuclear attack with the nuclear force as a pivot,\" it noted. If North Korea had not had nuclear capabilities, \"the US would have committed without hesitation the same brigandish aggression in Korea as what it committed against other countries,\" it said, apparently referring to the recent US air strike on Syria.

Bang Tae-hyun has been accused of taking a bribe of 100 million won ($87,950) from match-fixing brokers in exchange for throwing a bout at the Ultimate Fighting Championship event in South Korea in 2015. He will face a trial without detention. According to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Bang agreed to lose the contest against Leo Kuntz at UFC Fight Night 79 in Seoul. The scam, however, didn't succeed as the lightweight fighter apparently changed his mind at the last moment and went on to beat Kuntz with a split decision. In this file photo, taken on Nov. 28, 2015, South Korean mixed martial arts fighter Bang Tae-hyun (L) lands a punch on Leo Kuntz of the United States during their lightweight bout at the UFC Fight Night 79 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. (Yonhap)Bang reportedly decided not to throw the match after UFC officials warned him about fight fixing following a sudden shift in betting patterns on gambling websites. The 34-year-old was first listed as the slight favorite against Kuntz, but just hours before the fight the UFC officials caught drastic changes in odds that made him the underdog and his American opponent the overwhelming favorite. Bang is no longer with the UFC, the world's largest MMA promotion. After the UFC event in Seoul, Bang fought once more in Germany at the UFC Fight Night 93, where he lost to Nick Hein by unanimous decision. Bang was the seventh South Korean to enter the Octagon after he signed with the UFC in late 2013.The prosecutors also indicted fight-fixing brokers and those who helped them, adding that one of them was former MMA fighter Kim Dae-won. Kim, who previously completed in Japan-based MMA promotions like DEEP and Pride, told his acquaintances that he can fix the UFC bout by persuading Bang and later consulted with the brokers for fixing, according to the prosecutors.

Pyongyang has claimed that the exercise is a rehearsal for an invasion.North Korea said in June that it can place a moratorium on its nuclear and missile tests if the US suspends the military drills, but Seoul and Washington rejected the idea.\"The government has not considered adjusting the size of the military drill.

The number of co-signing professors are expected to rise further as organizers plan to collect signatures through Monday. Park, a former biology professor appointed to the post Monday, has been under pressure to step down due to her link to the 2005 scandal of Hwang Woo-suk, the country's leading stem cell scientist, using fabricated data in a research paper. Park Ki-young (Yonhap)Hwang was found to have used forged data for the paper to claim to have created the world's first cloned human embryo. Park, who was a co-author of the paper, resigned as a senior adviser to then-President Roh Moo-hyun after the scandal broke.Despite the pressure, however, Park has refused to step down. During a meeting with science community leaders Thursday, Park apologized over the stem cell scandal but said she wants to redeem herself by working to move the country's science and technology forward as a chief innovation official. \"At the time of the Hwang Woo-suk scandal in 2005, Park was the presidential science and technology secretary, a position that required her to take the most responsibility, but she never repented or apologized,\" the professors' statement said.\"Should professor Park hold on to the position, it would amount to exonerating Hwang Woo-suk and those protecting him,\" the statement said. \"This would be ignoring the efforts that South Korea's university and academic society puts into establishing research ethics. It would be a head-on affront to the science community.\"All opposition parties have also called for Park to step down.

(Yonhap)Last month, a woman lodged the first complaint with the prosecution, claiming her 5-year-old daughter now has permanently damaged kidneys due to hemolytic-uremic syndrome after eating a Happy Meal burger served with an undercooked patty. A few other families and an individual followed suit, putting the total number of claimed victims at five.Yet, the KCA said no enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, known to cause HUS, was found in any of the 38 hamburgers tested.The announcement came shortly after a regional court dismissed an injunction filed by the local unit of McDonald's seeking to stop the disclosure of the report.McDonald's claimed that the probe did not follow the proper procedures in transporting the food. It said the consumer watchdog official carried the burger in question in a shopping bag instead of a sealed and sterilized container designed to maintain a low temperature.The court, however, dismissed the fast-food chain's request earlier in the day. Following the ruling, McDonald's immediately released a statement saying that it is reviewing whether to file a separate suit against the KCA for disclosing the report results and failing to meet due procedures in the course of carrying out the inspection.

A 31-year-old freelancer, who only gave her surname Choi, also experienced health problems. \u201cSince I began to use the Lilian pads early this year, my period has shortened from seven days to two days. At first, I never thought it could a problem stemming from sanitary pads,\u201d Choi said. \u201cAfter I started to use organic cotton pads, the amount of menstrual blood increased,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just so furious at the unconscientious company as well as the government.\u201d A women\u2019s health advocacy group, Korean Women\u2019s Environmental Network, on Thursday released a survey on 3,009 women who said they had experienced abnormal symptoms after using the Lilian pads. According to the survey, 65.6 percent of them said that their menstruation cycle changed. Nearly 86 percent said that the amount of menstrual blood diminished. Some 68 percent said that their menstrual pain worsened, while 55.8 percent said that their menstruation or vagina-related diseases got worse.\u00a0 However, the Lilian brand passed government regulations in the latest April-May inspection. The firm initially refused to give refunds to consumers who purchased the Lilian pads, denying any links between health problems and use of its products. It said it had officially requested that the Korea Consumer Agency run a safety test on its products. But it reversed its stance and issued an apology Wednesday amid growing public outcry. Anyone who purchased the product can get a refund with a receipt whether the product was opened or not, starting on Aug. 28, it said. The country\u2019s leading retailers -- E-mart, Homeplus and Lotte Mart -- as well as major convenience stores and drug stores pulled the Lilian sanitary products from their shelves as of Thursday. Ko Kum-sook, an activist from the Korean Women\u2019s Environmental Network, said that the government should first find out whether the health problems are directly related to the use of pads.\u00a0\u201cAlso, there should be a nationwide inspection in all sanitary pads, but not by the current standards. Currently, all sanitary pads live up to the government\u2019s standards, but there are still women suffering from side effects,\u201d she said. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety currently checks nine types of chemicals, such as formaldehyde and fluorescent brightening agents, to check the safety of sanitary pads. But the chemicals\u00a0at the center of the controversy, volatile organic compounds, are not tested for. VOCs are not regulated in other countries either. Activists demand the government tighten its regulations by testing more types of chemicals potentially harmful to human health on sanitary pads before they are approved for sale. They also want the chemicals used in sanitary pads to be disclosed from now on. The ministry carried out on-site inspection on five sanitary pad makers Thursday including the controversial Klean Nara. But whether there are harmful levels of VOCs in the sanitary pads will not be confirmed because they are not included in the inspection. It is separately conducting a study on what impact VOCs have on human health. \u201cWe will bring forward the date of completion of the study as much as possible to relieve public concerns as it is an urgent issue,\u201d an official from the ministry said. \u201cIf VOCs are found to be harmful to human health, we will take necessary measures. Women\u2019s health advocacy groups have long raised concerns about the safety of sanitary pads, demanding thorough research into the safety of tampons, pads and other feminine hygiene products. In March, the Korean Women\u2019s Environmental Network released a result of a safety test on 10 disposable sanitary pads and panty liners sold by foreign and local firms here. The study, conducted by professor Kim Man-goo of Kangwon National University, showed that all the sanitary pads contained more than 200 types of VOC, including cancer-causing benzene. VOCs, which are released from products at ordinary room temperature, include a variety of chemicals which may have short and long-term adverse health effects. Among the pads sold here, Lilian sanitary pads and panty liners were revealed to contain the highest concentration of VOCs. But the safety of sanitary pads was brought into the spotlight only recently after women began to share online complaints that their menstrual cycles were interrupted when they were using the product. Some are now turning to menstrual cups, which will be approved for sale here from September, and reusable cotton sanitary pads, instead of the possibly chemical-ridden disposable pads. But such options are still new to many Korean women. \u201cOrganic cotton pads are too expensive and menstrual cups are difficult to carry around,\u201d Seo said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to use.\u201dAccording to a survey by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety released in May, some 81 percent of women use sanitary pads, and only 11 percent use tampons. Most of them, or 36.4 percent of them, considered convenience the most important factor.

This photo, taken on July 20, 2017, shows President Moon Jae-in and Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party, talking during a state finance strategy meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. (Yonhap)The party leadership informed its 120 lawmakers of the invitation through a text message earlier in the day.The party lawmakers are scheduled to hold a two-day workshop in Sejong, about 150 kilometers south of Seoul, and move to the presidential office for the luncheon with the president, the officials said.A series of Moon's policy initiatives require legal revisions.Among others, his push for the tax code revision is expected to go through tough scrutiny as the main opposition Liberty Korea Party opposes it, claiming it could hamper corporate investment and competitiveness. (Yonhap)","834":"President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday introduced a government move to significantly reform the state-run health care program that will greatly reduce the medical expenses of patients, especially those in the low-income bracket, while providing new and enhanced benefits.At the same time, the president vowed to keep the rise in insurance payments at a minimum. (Yonhap)\"Medical expenses continue to increase. The number of people spending more than 5 million won ($4,406) a year stands at around 460,000. Medical costs are leading to failures of families,\" he said while meeting with patients at a local general hospital, according to a script of his remarks released by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.The president also noted high medical spending was the second largest cause of households dipping into the lowest income bracket, following unemployment.He said efforts to improve the health care system will immediately begin and continue throughout 2022.\"We will build a country where every person is free of concern over medical costs and can receive treatment for any disorder without having to worry about expenses,\" Moon said.First, the government will expand the type and number of treatments entitled to insurance coverage.Currently, patients must solely bear the cost of any treatment that is not specifically covered by the state insurance program.In the future, all will be covered by the state insurance program except for treatment that is clearly not included, such as plastic surgery, Moon said.Also, the upper ceiling on the annual medical spending that must come out of one's own pocket will be lowered, more than doubling the number of people who will benefit from the annual limit to 1.9 million in 2022 from the current 700,000, the president noted.\"In addition, the upper limit for those in the lower 30 percent income-bracket will be reduced to 1 million won per year,\" he said.Emergency financial support will be expanded to provide up to20 million won in emergency financial support to patients in the lower 50 percent of the income-bracket.Such measures, once implemented, will help reduce annual medical spending of all people by an average 18 percent, and 46 percent for the low-income population, Moon noted.The president said the additional benefits will require an additional 30.6 trillion won over the next five years.About 10 trillion won will come from the accumulated profits made by operating the massive health care fund, while the government will shoulder the rest, he added.\"The government will work to make sure that insurance payments will not increase at a greater rate than the average rate of the past 10 years,\" the president said.\"We will continue to move toward building a fair and just Republic of Korea that will ache when the people ache and will only smile when the people smile,\" he said.

They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\" Trump told reporters at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to a pool report.(Yonhap)The warning comes after the North threatened to retaliate and take \"physical\" action against the US over the United Nations' adoption of new sanctions on Saturday.The sanctions followed Pyongyang's two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles last month.Shortly before Trump's warning, the Washington Post cited US intelligence officials as saying that the reclusive regime has succeeded in producing a nuclear warhead that can fit atop its missiles.The assessment was made by the Defense Intelligence Agency last month, the paper said, marking another alarming development in the communist country's pursuit of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles that can reach the US mainland.\"The IC (intelligence community) assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,\" the assessment said, according to the Washington Post.In response to queries from Yonhap, both the Pentagon and the State Department declined to comment, saying the assessment falls under the realm of intelligence.The Post said a separate intelligence assessment concluded the North has built up to 60 nuclear warheads, a number far larger than independent experts' estimates.North Korea claimed in September that it had successfully tested the kind of nuclear warhead described in the report. Experts have remained skeptical.Ken Gause, a North Korea expert who is director of the International Affairs Group at CNA Corp., was cautious to embrace the assessment.\"It's been almost a year since the fifth nuclear test. What has taken so long to reach this conclusion by the IC?\" he said in an email to Yonhap. \"Does it represent a general conclusion of the IC or only parts of it? And why has this new projection emerged at a point of heightened tensions on the peninsula?\"Last week, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the US is preparing for a \"preventive war\" with North Korea.\"If they have nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States, it's intolerable from the president's perspective. So of course, we have to provide all options to do that. And that includes a military option,\" he told MSNBC.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told NBC days earlier that the president told him there would be a war with the North if it continued to try to hit the US with an ICBM.

(Yonhap)It was when Korea was under Japan's harsh colonial rule from 1910-1945.\"It is difficult to see that individual rights to damages are included in the Korea-Japan reparations treaty,\" the court said, referring to the 1965 agreement between Seoul and Tokyo on resolving colonial-era issues. Japan has claimed that all colonial-era issues, including individual compensation, were resolved with the treaty.\"In cooperation with the Japanese government, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries forced young women to toil under dangerous and poor working conditions without giving pay,\" the court said in the verdict. \"The plaintiffs (victims) either lost their lives or sustained severe burns and lived concerned about being mistaken for military comfort women.\"The court said that the amount of compensation for Choe's family member, who is an in-law of the victim, was determined according to the relative's inheritance share based on the total compensation (150 million won) the victim was supposed to receive. Mitsubishi is expected to appeal the ruling.Mitsubishi is one of the most representative Japanese firms involved in forced labor during the war. The company is also featured in a recently released South Korean box-office hit, \"The Battleship Island,\" which tells the story of hundreds of Korean forced laborers who risk their lives to escape.Tuesday's ruling is the first such case since President Moon Jae-in took office in May. It is one of a total of 14 such cases that South Korean victims have filed against Mitsubishi and other Japanese firms over forced labor.The same court is also scheduled to hand down a verdict in a similar case Friday. Three surviving victims and one bereaved family member filed the suit in 2014, demanding Mitsubishi pay them a total of 600 million won. It took 3 1\/2 years for the court to deliver its first trial verdict. The plaintiffs have accused the Japanese firm of foot dragging.Japan's harsh colonial rule left deep scars on the hearts of Koreans. During that period, Koreans were banned from using their own language at schools and forced to adopt Japanese names.Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were also mobilized as forced laborers and sex slaves.

(Yonhap)","847":"Religious groups in South Korea are preparing for the imposition of taxes on clergy members starting next year, as the government's new tax code revision blueprint did make changes to the upcoming tax duty plan pertaining to clerical workers.Last week, the government announced a plan to amend the current tax code to raise the rate for the superrich and conglomerates, in what many see as a move to finance the Moon Jae-in government's pledges on job creation and social welfare expansion. Changes were not made to the newly established clergy taxation clause, which goes into effect starting January 2018.\"If it's not included in the announcement, then that means the taxing on clerical workers will begin next year as scheduled,\" a senior finance ministry official said. The bill is part of the government-led efforts to establish equal taxation. Religious figures have been exempted from paying income taxes for decades, given that their work is regarded as a spiritual service, not labor.The Presbyterian Church of Korea's Tonghap branch, one of the country's largest religious groups, has agreed on the taxation from early on, having held seminars and education programs for its members since last year. Last month, the group held a meeting with the finance ministry and the National Tax Service to exchange views on the pending taxation plan. In this file photo, a group of activists from the Korea Taxpayers` Association hold a protest rally in front of the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee building in central Seoul on May 31, 2017, demanding that clerical workers pay taxes like all waged workers. (Yonhap)\"The imposition starting next year is the right course of action. The government has deferred it for four years since first announcing it in 2013. There's no more cause for postponing it,\" said Kim Jin-ho, former head of the branch's taxation committee, who attended the meeting with the finance officials.The National Council of Churches in Korea also issued a statement accepting the newly imposed duties, saying, \"Everyone comes under the obligation to pay one's taxes.\"But the more conservative-leaning protestant circles are against the pending taxation plan, especially the Presbyterian Church of Korea's Hapdong branch, an Evangelical Presbyterian denomination.\"I've been paying my income taxes since 10 years ago. I'm not saying I won't pay taxes. But we're not a communist country, and if the government hastily writes up a law and tells us to follow it unilaterally, it will do more harm than good,\" said Rev. So Kang-seok, chairman of the branch's taxation committee.A representative of the conservative-leaning Christian Council of Korea commented, \"What if pseudo-religious groups pay taxes and ask the government to recognize them as legitimate entities?\"Catholic priests have been voluntarily paying income taxes since the mid-1990s, and a growing number of religious leaders have expressed their intention to pay taxes on their earnings.\"As a member of the public the Catholic clergy has also dutifully paid taxes and will continue to follow state laws,\" a representative of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea said.The Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, the country's largest Buddhist sect, also approves of the taxation plan. \"I hope that the finance ministry and the NTS will prepare more meetings and education in the remaining time before the plan takes effect,\" Ven. Jookyung of the order said.Rep. Kim Jin-pyo of the ruling Democratic Party, who also headed the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee that disbanded last month, meanwhile, has called for the government to defer the tax plan until 2020 and plans to submit a related bill to parliament this month.\"I will submit an income tax revision bill that calls for the postponement of the clerical taxation until January 2020. I've received about 30 signatures from fellow lawmakers,\" Kim told Yonhap News Agency over the phone.Kim explained that his bill is designed to urge the government to better prepare against potential friction between authorities and religious leaders.\"It would be critical for a pastor or a Buddhist priest to undergo a tax audit without proper preparation (by the government), then be reported by the media,\" Kim said. \"The bill's aim is to prevent such incidents from occurring through thorough preparation.

The annual ASEAN Regional Forum hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will gather together 27 foreign ministers from nations across the region and the European Union. The ARF launched in 1994 is a rare international gathering attended by the North, along with all other countries involved in the now-suspended six-party talks aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions. This year's forum comes amid increasing pressure on the North following its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, which prompted the United Nations Security Council to adopt a fresh sanctions resolution Saturday (local time).A chairman's statement will be issued at the end of the forum. The ARF statement issued after last year's meeting in Laos expressed concerns over tensions around the Korean Peninsula and its support for efforts to denuclearize the North.\u00a0 (Yonhap)Keen attention is placed on North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho's remarks during the meeting. Since his arrival here Sunday, Ri has stayed mum. Last year he talked about the North's stance on the UNSC sanctions. In a bilateral meeting with Ri on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for Pyongyang to stop nuclear and missile tests. Their traditionally close relations have been strained after North Korea's defiant military provocations despite Beijing's warnings.An informed source told Yonhap that the North will likely hold a press meeting after the ARF is over to make its stance on the growing pressure on its regime and other issues clear.

(Yonhap)The man, initially spotted on the track near Gimhae International Airport Station, was shortly reported to the BGLRT by the passers-by. However, it took 50 minutes since the initial report for the BGLRT to remove him from the railway, after he had walked 4 kilometers down the track.According to the BGLRT, the 22-year old man from Kiribati, a country in the Pacific Ocean, was on his way to Gimhae International Airport to catch his flight. Wandering around under the influence of alcohol, he got stranded from his company and walked into the train track.The man\u2019s act was an infraction of the Railroad Safety Act, but the BGLRT had let him leave the country without putting him under a proper investigation.In the absence of a\u00a0thorough investigation, the BGLRT has still been unable to identify the exact route through which the man broke into the train track: a crucial piece of information needed to identify the weak spot in the railway\u2019s safety mechanism and prevent such trespassing in the future.The BGLRT also did not report the incident to its oversight body, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.(mjk625@heraldcorp.com)","850":"\u201cOur wish is unification, even in our dreams.\u201dA group of elderly people sang in unison, while neatly placing envelopes in plastic wrapping.

(Jung Min-kyung\/The Korea Herald)But chances for them to land a decent job, or even the menial, low-paying jobs that most defectors end up with, are not very high. About 40 percent of the defector population of 30,000 in South Korea are jobless, said Kim Hee-bong, manager of the Korea Hana Foundation\u2019 defector self-reliance support team. Senior defectors are perhaps the least privileged group in the country\u2019s fiercely competitive job market. On top of the many handicaps that usually comes with the tag of being a North Korean defector, such as language barrier, cultural differences, and social discrimination, older ones have age and health issues and tend to be slow learners.\u00a0 \u201cMost of them suffer from some form of illness -- it\u2019s mainly due to malnutrition in the North, and disabilities they suffered while crossing the inter-Korean border,\u201d said Kim. To alleviate the issue, state-run defector aid agencies such as Hanawon and Kim\u2019s Hana Foundation are running facilities and programs to help them lead a financially independent life. The Nowon assistance center is one such facility.\u00a0 Seo Yoo-jung, the chief manager of the center who is a defector herself, said defectors face hardships in adjusting to a capitalist economy. Seo supervised the first senior job training program at the center when it opened in July.\u00a0 \u201cIn North Korea, we are told what to do -- work there doesn\u2019t require as much creative thinking as it does here,\u201d Seo said.\u00a0 \u201cThe language is also different here, which is why defectors experience difficulties even while serving in restaurants. It\u2019s challenging to communicate with customers here.\u201d According to Seo, most defectors lack office skills, which forces them to take basic jobs in the service sector, such as restaurant servers. Also, they believe office work here is too rigorous and competitive by their standards.\u00a0 A male defector in his 60s participating in the job program in Nowon was forced to accept the harsh reality, but stressed that being jobless was not what he aimed for. \u201cThe work culture in South Korea took a toll on me both physically and mentally,\u201d a defector surnamed Han said. \u201cBut staying at home (without a job) was much worse.\u201d To bring down the barrier, Hanawon has been providing funds to defectors willing to enter and complete its 500-hour job training program since 2005. Women, especially single mothers who risked their lives to bring their children to the South with them, are also suffering from the lack of jobs here. Government data shows that 70 percent of the defector population are women. \u201cI came to South Korea eight years ago with my daughter and son,\u201d said a female defector in her 40s, who requested anonymity. \u201cForeigners who work here have the freedom to visit their motherland, but we don\u2019t. I find companionship at the center where I can talk with my fellow defectors from my home country,\u201d she tearfully said. North Korean defectors earn an average of 1.5 million won ($1,350) a month, which amounts to just about 67 percent of South Korea\u2019s average monthly wage of 2.3 million won, according to data released by the National Assembly Budget Office in 2016. Financial hardships are among the biggest difficulties they face here. In a 2015 government survey of 12,000 defectors, 20.9 percent of the group had suicidal thoughts at least once after their arrival in South Korea, 6.8 percentage points higher than South Koreans. About 30 percent stated financial hardships as the main reason.

The draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would also ban countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers _ another source of money for Kim Jong Un\u2018s regime. And it would prohibit all new joint ventures with North Korean companies, and ban new foreign investment in existing joint ventures. Egypt, which holds the Security Council presidency, said a vote on the draft resolution has been scheduled at 3 p.m. EDT on Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The proposed new sanctions follow North Korea\u2019s first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States on July 3 and July 27. The Security Council has already imposed six rounds of sanctions that have failed to halt North Korea\u2018s drive to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities. (Yonhap)The draft resolution condemns the launches ``in the strongest terms\u2019\u2018 and reiterates previous calls for North Korea to suspend all ballistic missile launches and abandon its nuclear weapons and nuclear program ``in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.\u2019\u2018 The United States spent weeks following the initial ICBM launch negotiating the text with China, North Korea\u2019s neighbor and ally.  The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, called it the ``most impactful and expansive set of sanctions to date\u2018\u2019 and said the resolution is expected to be approved unanimously. Agreement on the draft to be put to a vote followed\u00a0US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2018s comments Wednesday reassuring North Korea that Washington isn\u2019t seeking regime change or an accelerated reunification of the Korean Peninsula\u00a0-- comments welcomed by China\u2018s foreign minister.  Tillerson also said the\u00a0US wants to talk eventually with North Korea, but doesn\u2019t think discussions would be productive if the North comes with the intention of maintaining its nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it sees as a guarantee of its security. The draft resolution reiterates language in previous Security Council resolutions supporting a return to six-party talks with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, expressing the Security Council\u2018s commitment ``to a peaceful, diplomatic, and political solution to the situation,\u2019\u2018 and reiterating the importance of maintaining peace and stability in northeast Asia. It also expresses regret at North Korea\u2019s ``massive diversion of its scarce resources toward its development of nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs\u2018\u2019 noting\u00a0UN findings that well over half the population lacks sufficient food and medical care and a quarter of the population suffers from chronic malnutrition.  While the draft resolution would impose biting economic sanctions, the\u00a0US didn\u2018t get everything it wanted. In early July,\u00a0US Ambassador Nikki Haley told the Security Council that if it was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions, and hold senior officials accountable. Oil was not included in the draft resolution and neither are new air restrictions. But the draft resolution would ban all exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. According to the diplomat, coal has been North Korea\u2019s largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year which was then restricted by the Security Council to a maximum $400 million. This year, Pyongyang was estimated to earn $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from seafood exports, the diplomat said. That total\u2018s over $1 billion. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much money North Korea earns from sending workers overseas but in 2015 the\u00a0UN special investigator on human rights in North Korea, Marzuki Darusman, estimated it was earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion annually.  Under the draft, countries would be unable to hire any new North Korean workers.  The proposed resolution would also add nine North Koreans, mainly officials or representatives of companies and banks, to the\u00a0UN sanctions blacklist, banning their travel and freezing their assets. It would also impose an asset freeze on two companies and two banks. The diplomat called the Foreign Trade Bank ``a very critical clearing house for foreign exchange.\u2018\u2019 The Mansudae Overseas Project Group of Companies, which was also added to the list, is described in the draft resolution as engaged in exporting workers for construction, including of monuments, in Africa and Southeast Asia. The draft resolution asks the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea to ban the import of many more so-called ``dual-use items\u2018\u2019 that have commercial use but can also be used in conventional weapons or biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. It would also give a green light for the committee to designate specific vessels that are breaking sanctions from entering ports all over the world, and to work with INTERPOL to enforce travel bans on North Koreans on the sanctions blacklist.","858":"A South Korean civic group said Friday it will erect a statue in a park in the city of Incheon, west of Seoul, next week to commemorate Korean victims of forced labor under Japan\u2018s colonial rule.\u00a0The group is scheduled to unveil the bronze statue at the park across from what used to be an arsenal belonging to the Japanese Imperial Army on Friday next week.

The state mouthpiece added that one of the game\u2019s main purposes is to educate its users through the use of realistic strategies, tactics and techniques. It also stressed that the game reflects modern-day soccer and trends. Like the \u201cFIFA\u201d video game series, the game allows its players to experience simulations of major tournaments including the prestigious UEFA Champions League and the UEFA European Championship. The game also features realistic characters based on actual soccer players and what is perceived as an expert evaluation of the athletes\u2019 statistics. The statistics in such games include speed, stamina and temperament. Complementary settings such as training and highlights are also included in the package, which happens to be a characteristic of the FIFA series. The game is reportedly built for PC, mobiles with the Android system and Kinect, which is a line of motion sensing devices by Microsoft. North Korea has been developing computer games over the years, despite most of its citizens\u2019 restricted access to the internet, PCs and mobile phones.

A Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey last year showed that 74 percent of office workers suffer because of the practice, with 60 percent of them saying they were extremely stressed out.It also found that about 11.3 hours are spent a week handling work orders via smart devices while off duty.The labor ministry plans to collect views from unions and companies on the practice by the end of the year while commissioning a research study to look into how widespread the practice is by industry, a ministry official said. The ministry also plans to study France's ban on using SNS to give work-related orders after working hours.Officials said they're considering adopting guidelines on the practice and encourage companies to follow them voluntarily rather than legislating a ban. They say it would be difficult to enforce such a ban in a nation used to long working hours.\"Many office workers are believed to be suffering from work orders coming via Kakao Talk even after taking off from work,\" a ministry official said. \"From the bigger perspective of improving long working hours, we believe this is a matter that must be fixed.\"Lawmakers have called for ending the practice.Rep.

(Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea Herald)The center was among several community-level facilities that opened in 1997, as part of the government\u2019s campaign to promote and nurture volunteerism in South Korea, after rapid urbanization and industrialization destroyed communities. Ahn was one of the few first-generation volunteer coordination and management experts in the country. Nearly two decades have passed since then, but Ahn says South Korea still has a long way to go when it comes to discovering the joy of helping others.\u00a0 (Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea Herald)In her opinion, the current education system takes the wrong approach to volunteerism, making students feel as if volunteer work is extra homework -- something that they do because they are \u201ctold to do so.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so burdensome for young students to wake up early in the morning and go pick up trash for a certain amount of hours just because they are told to do so. They would think that volunteering is time-consuming, boring and meaningless.\u201dUntil 2000, South Korea\u2019s middle and high schools forced students to spend 20 hours annually volunteering for their community. It has since become more flexible and the required hours are down to 10. The system of mandatory hours of community service or volunteer work has led to a barrage of students each year counterfeiting their certificates of volunteer service or inflating their service hours.Ahn, who now heads the Seoul Volunteer Center, said that South Korea\u2019s volunteering culture is \u201cconservative,\u201d often associated with the stereotype of one-off street cleaning campaigns or helping the disabled at welfare centers. \u201cMost volunteering programs here involve welfare programs. Volunteer program facilitators as well as participants should think out of the box and forget the concept of mandatory volunteer hours. Volunteering can be more fun and easy, done in everyday life.\u201d\u201cVolunteering is not difficult. It is as simple as showing others that we respect them and sharing what we have,\u201d she said. In a similar vein, the Seoul volunteer center is exploring creative ways of volunteering, she stressed. At a recent conference organized by her center, over 250 volunteer program managers, experts and social workers gathered to discuss ways to change the volunteering paradigm, such as venturing into digital platforms. In a society where social disconnection and isolation are major problems, she said regular volunteering can help communities. She suggested that active participation from those in their 20s and 30s could make a society even stronger.\u201cAlthough those in their 20 and 30s are riddled with serious unemployment, the low birthrate and housing problems, a good dose of volunteering can help them contribute to community and provide them with the time to look back on themselves amid busy daily routines,\u201d she said. Noting that the young generation\u2019s participation in volunteering is more crucial ever than before, the Seoul Volunteer Center plans to financially support startups and social entrepreneurs that strive to make a social impact and spread positive messages. \u201cWe do not know yet the exact budget for the project. I think it will be probably small, but we\u2019ve decided to help them because it is our -- as a volunteer center -- role to serve the society,\u201d Ahn said.

The ministry also called it \"groundless\" to criticize Russia, along with China, for acquiescing the North's nuclear and missile ambitions, apparently pointing to an argument in the US that the two countries should be held responsible for the current nuclear stalemate.

We'll be able to handle North Korea,\" he said, according to a pool report. \"It will be handled. We handle everything.\"The president did not elaborate further, leaving some to wonder what he meant by the word \"handle.\" US President Donald Trump (Yonhap)The question was raised during a Pentagon press briefing later in the day, to which a spokesman responded that the US will uphold its alliances with South Korea and Japan and come to their defense should either of them come under attack.The spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, also said the Pentagon is committed to defending the homeland and providing the president and other decision makers with \"military options.\"\"We're always working on that,\" Davis said.He added, however, that military options are only one part of a broader US strategy that also includes diplomatic and financial pressures on the regime in Pyongyang.\"Some of them involve other countries like China,\" he said.Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration with China, saying the world's second largest economy does \"nothing for us with North Korea, just talk.\"China, a key ally and economic benefactor of the North, has been reluctant to push the regime too hard out of considerations for its own national security. Beijing rejects the argument, saying the nuclear conundrum is an issue to be solved between Washington and Pyongyang.Trump has made ambiguous statements about North Korea before. In January, he tweeted, \"It won't happen!\" with regard to the regime's claim of being in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the USThe two ICBM tests on US Independence Day and last Friday demonstrated the North has made significant progress in its pursuit of such a weapon, according to experts.After Friday's test, Trump issued a statement condemning the launch and warning of deeper isolation for such \"reckless and dangerous\" action. (Yonhap)","881":"With two successful missile launches in July, North Korea has showcased its ability to obtain the range required for intercontinental ballistic missiles. However, a major hurdle remains for North Korea to prove it can actually hit targets on the US mainland: re-entry technology.\u00a0 North Korea test-fires a Hwasong-14 ballistic missile on July 4. YonhapConsidered to be the final component of nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, the technology is crucial to ensuring the missiles withstand extreme temperatures and pressure when re-entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without it, the missile could spring back to outer space or explode in midair.Despite the North\u2019s claim that the recent missile tests -- launches of the Hwasong-14 on July 4 and its extended version on Friday -- proved it had reliable re-entry technology, controversy persists over whether this is the case. South Korean\u2019s Ministry of National Defense and missile experts maintain that it is too early to determine whether the North has secured the technology, but some politicians and analysts suggest Pyongyang may have cleared the hurdle, particularly through Friday\u2019s ICBM launch. \u201cIt is fair to say that North Korea has already secured re-entry technology for nuclear warheads,\u201d said Rep. Kim Young-woo of the minor opposition Bareun Party, who serves as a chairman of the National Assembly\u2019 national defense committee. Citing NHK footage of an ICBM falling into the waters off Japan\u2019s island Hokkaido, the lawmaker suggested that the missile\u2019s warhead might have endured extreme heat and pressure because the flash of the light emitted by the projectile was \u201cnot dispersed,\u201d Kim also said that North Korea might have perfected the technology to accurately control missile trajectory, saying Pyongyang successfully delivered the missile to an area some 170 kilometers from Hokkaido, in a deliberate process that requires advanced navigation system. Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, citing military analysts, introduced similar arguments that North Korea has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in re-entry technology. Unlike the previous Hwasong-14 test, the warhead of the ICBM fired Friday fell into the water without exploding in the re-entry phase, it added. But the South Korean Ministry of National Defense remains cautious on such views. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too early to determine if Friday\u2019s ICBM launch showed (a successful) re-entry test,\u201d Defense Minister Song Young-moo told lawmakers on Monday. When North Korea fired the Hwasong-14, then-Defense Minister Han Min-koo was pessimistic as to whether the North had developed a workable re-entry vehicle, saying Pyongyang has yet to show the missile\u2019s warhead can withstand temperatures of at least 7,000 degrees Celsius. Seoul-based aerospace experts agreed the North has yet to secure reliable re-entry technology, even though it appears clear that Pyongyang has inched closer to the goal. Jang Young-geun, a professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at Korea Aerospace University, said that unless North Korea presents \u201chard evidence,\u201d it is difficult to verify the North\u2019s claims about a re-entry vehicle. \u201cFrom the perspective of an engineer, it is quite difficult to verify their claim unless they retrieve the missile that splashed down in the sea, which I think is quite unlikely. Plus, North Korea didn\u2019t even mention the re-entry vehicle when they made the ICBM announcement yesterday,\u201d said Jang. Jang also noted that an ICBM would be met with a \u201ccompletely different re-entry environment\u201d when deliberately fired at a lofty angle, as the North has done with recent ICBM tests, compared to being launched at a normal angle during an actual attack.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","882":"South Korea and the United States are seeking to hold a meeting of their defense ministers at an early date to discuss North Korea's evolving missile threats, government officials said Monday.The two sides are pushing for the first meeting between Defense Minister Song Myoung-moo and his US counterpart Jim Mattis before the allies' annual Security Consultative Meeting slated for October, Seoul's defense ministry said.Song, a former Navy chief of staff, took office this month as South Korea's defense chief. This photo taken on July 31, 2017, shows South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo speaking to lawmakers over North Korea`s missile threats.

However, the allies failed to reach an agreement over the deployment at the SCM held in October 2016.Instead, they agreed to review it at a meeting of the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group, joint defense cooperation talks which were first held in December last year.The US has periodically sent strategic assets to South Korea including B-1B bombers as a show of force when North Korea's provocative acts heightened.

(Yonhap)The prosecution said there was no evidence that the party\u2019s co-founders Ahn and Park Jie-won, or Rep. Lee Yong-ju who led the campaign team, had been a part of the fabrication scheme. Four days ahead of the May 9 election, the centrist opposition party revealed that Moon, then the front-runner for the Democratic Party of Korea, peddled influence to get his son hired at a state-run agency in 2006. He was then a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. The party disclosed an audio file as evidence in which a person, who claims to be a schoolmate of Moon\u2019s son, Joon-yong, from Parsons School of Design in New York, said Moon\u2019s son had landed a job at the Korea Employment Information Service due to his father\u2019s influence.The recording had been fabricated by the People\u2019s Party\u2019s Lee You-mi and the schoolmate of the younger Moon in the audio file turned out to actually be her brother, according to the prosecution. The party\u2019s former Supreme Council member Lee Joon-seo willfully neglected the possibility that the tip-off had been falsified, it said.The prosecution filed charges against five people -- including Lee Joon-seo, Lee You-mi and her brother -- for conspiring to fabricate evidence to smear Moon on the campaign trail. The prosecution charged them with violation of the election law for spreading false information, saying the party officials had disclosed the phony audio file without any efforts to verify its authenticity. An internal probe by the People\u2019s Party also concluded that the fabrication was Lee You-mi\u2019s lone act. Lee, however, claimed the party\u2019s leadership ordered her to do so. The People\u2019s Party later formally issued an apology for the fabrication, promising to start anew, following a party meeting Monday afternoon.\u201cWe deeply apologize for causing trouble to the public with the tip-off fabrication case that took place during the presidential campaign,\u201d it said in a statement, acknowledging its responsibility for failing to \u201cfilter illegal acts by a party member.\u201dAllegations surrounding Moon\u2019s son had been one of the key points of attack against then-front-runner Moon during the presidential campaign period.The scandal placed the People\u2019s Party into a crisis 1 1\/2 years after its launch.

In its test-fire of an intermediate-range ballistic missile on May 14 and an ICBM missile on July 4, the North also adopted the same method.Experts speculate that the use of a ground-based launcher may be intended to protect the high-priced TEL. In addition, the North may be able to carry out additional missile launches by use of the TEL, they noted.North Korea is believed to possess about 200 TELs.After the countdown was over, the Hwasong-14 missile flashed in all directions and lifted off vertically toward the night sky, according to the TV footage. Under the first-stage propulsion, large and small flame gusts were observed from a main engine and four auxiliary engines, it showed.The footage showed a stable liftoff of the missile but didn't include the separation of the first and second stages.The Rodong Sinmun, the North's main newspaper, also carried 37 pictures, including a picture of Kim shown signing a handwritten memo that orders the launch.The daily published additional photos throughout the paper, such as one showing Kim looking at a monitor displaying missile trajectory data and another one showing Kim surrounded by party members.

That armistice is yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula technically in a state of war.\u00a0North Korea generally waits hours or sometimes a day or more before announcing launches, often with a raft of photos in the ruling party newspaper or on the television news. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is usually shown at the site to observe and supervise major launches.\u00a0\u00a0Late night launches are rare. North Korea usually conducts its missile and underground nuclear tests in the morning. It's likely the North launched the missile at night and from the remote province of Jagang to demonstrate its operational versatility.

The text bans any sale of crude oil, condensates, refined petroleum, liquefied natural gas and other natural gas resources, with an exception being heavy fuel oil, gasoline or diesel fuel for humanitarian use, as well as the transfer of bulk cash, precious metals and gemstones. It also mandated the secretary of state submit a report on whether Pyongyang meets the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism within 90 days of the act taking effect.On Russia, the legislation is designed to block Trump from unilaterally lifting penalties slapped by his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s administration for the Ukraine crisis. The sanctions against Iran were aimed at blacklisting additional entities for their suspected support of terror, weapons trade and the country\u2019s missile program. Republican Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, lauded the passage of the bill, saying it sends a \u201cstrong signal\u201d to the three countries that \u201cour country will stand firm and united in the face of their destabilizing behavior.\u201d\u201cThis bill ensures Congress will continue to play a leading role in defending the American people and our allies from these serious threats while providing the Trump administration appropriate national security flexibility,\u201d he said in a statement.White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci told CNN on Thursday that Trump may \u201csign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians.\u201d\u00a0 This image released Friday by state media shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visiting a cemetery to commemorate fallen veterans during the 1950-53 Korean War, marking the armistice anniversary on Thursday.

(Yonhap)The panel's explanation triggered a controversy as it was seen as a reversal of the government's pledge that \"citizen jurors\" will have the final say over the highly polarizing issue that could affect President Moon Jae-in's overall energy policy direction.\"During the public deliberation process, the decision on whether to approve of or disapprove of (the reactor construction) will be made,\" a presidential official told Yonhap News Agency over the phone, declining to be named.The panel began its three-month operation on Monday amid concerns that the cancellation of the construction, which is nearly30 percent complete, would incur some 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion) in losses, and trigger many layoffs and damage suits. The suspension of the construction last month was in line with Moon's pursuit of an energy policy shift away from nuclear power, which experts warn could lead to a hefty rise in electricity prices and a potential energy shortage.The panel plans to conduct a survey on the issue on around 20,000 citizens next month. Among the 20,000 citizens, it plans to pick 350 people who will engage in the full-fledged deliberation process. The final decision on the reactors is to be made by Oct. 21.

(Yonhap)The official, who is well-versed in North Korea affairs, spoke as there is growing alarm about the North's saber-rattling. On July 4, Pyongyang successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii.\"We're now at a point where this is going to become a fait accompli pretty soon,\" he said on the condition of anonymity.\"Whenever we think, 'What are we going to do?' we have to think, 'How is he going to respond? What activities are we going to prompt in him? What conditions are we going to create for (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-un?'\"The Donald Trump administration has repeatedly warned that the US could use military options in response to the North's mounting threats. Pyongyang claims its missile and nuclear program is aimed at deterring what it calls US hostility.\"The fact that he's absolutely committed to the nuclear program, it's the same as the father,\" the official said, referring to Kim and his late father and former leader, Kim Jong-il. \"It's just now, it's near culmination.\"\u00a0The official also pointed to a different pattern of provocations and responses under Kim. During the rule of his grandfather and North Korea founder Kim Il-sung, there was a 10-year cycle of provocations, negotiations with the US and subsequent concessions. That was shortened to five years under his son, and then to a year at most under his grandson, according to the official.\"I think you can absorb those cycles with a 10-year or five-year (period). One year cycle -- this is going to create conditions that drive us toward a response that doesn't exist inside that current cycle,\" he said.Asked if chances are higher now for a military response, he noted, \"The fact that they're more frequent provocation cycles doesn't necessarily make them (military options) more likely because it really is the degree of provocation.\"In different political conditions, the North's sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010 could have prompted a military response, he added.The official also underscored the threat posed by North Korea's conventional military capabilities, including its army, the fourth largest in the world.

South Korea's unification ministry earlier gave the green light to the company's plan to contact the North to arrange the memorial service. If the company was invited to hold the event, it would have marked the first visit by South Koreans to the North under the Moon Jae-in administration. In July 2008, Seoul suspended the Kumgang tour project after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort. The program was launched in 1998 under a previous liberal government.The new government announced its stance on the flexible resumption of civilian inter-Korean exchanges to an extent that would not compromise the international sanctions imposed Pyongyang.North Korea, however, has turned down South Korean aid groups' move to spur exchanges, in protest of Seoul's support of the latest U.N. sanctions.The Seoul government has separately proposed holding talks on easing border tensions and arranging family reunions, but Pyongyang has also kept mum on such overtures.

The offer was met with a positive response from Trump and is likely to be discussed during the allies\u2019 annual high-profile security meetings later this year, such as the Security Consultative Meeting and the Korea-US Integrated Defense Dialogue, the sources added. But renegotiating the bilateral agreement would be an uphill battle, analysts noted, as it could provoke strong opposition from neighboring countries, in particular China, which may see South Korea\u2019s enhanced missile capability as a security threat.\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea`s Hyunmoo 2A ballistic missile. Yonhap\u201c(The revision on missile warheads) would allow South Korea to possess destructive retaliation capability against North Korea\u2019s potential nuclear attacks,\u201d said Kim Dong-yup, a military expert and professor at Kyungnam University\u2019s Far East Institute.\u201cBut the increased weight would lead to extending the missiles\u2019 range, which is likely to make neighboring countries, such as China, feel worried. I think the government is in a difficult position because the plan was revealed to the public before the government builds its case.\u201dThe presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday remained mum about whether it would pursue a revision to the pact. It also refused to comment on whether the issue would be discussed during the allies\u2019 security meetings.Under the current agreement with the US, sealed in 2012, South Korea is banned from mounting more than 500-kilogram warheads onto 800-kilometer range ballistic missiles that can reach almost every part of North Korea. The clause has remained a constraint on South Korea\u2019 capability to take out North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities and its wartime command, as 500-kilogram warheads are thought not to be strong enough to destroy facilities hidden in deep mountain caves or underground. \u201cWith a 1-ton warhead, we will make remarkable progress in our ability to strike North Korea\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Jang Young-geun, a missile expert and professor of aerospace and mechanic engineering at Korea Aerospace University.But revising the agreement would prompt opposition from neighboring countries, analysts warned, suggesting that if the allies were to agree on a new deal, South Korea could develop extended range ballistic missiles capable of reaching China and Russia.Under the 2012 guideline\u2019s \u201ctrade-off\u201d principle, South Korea can increase the range of the missile proportionately should the range decrease, meaning that it could develop a 1,600-kilometer range ballistic missile with a 500-kilogram warhead.When South Korea deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system batteries to fend off North Korea\u2019s short-and-medium range missiles last year, China opposed the move, claiming that THAAD\u2019s advanced radar could spy on its territories. \u201cIf there were such discussions between South Korea and US leaders, the government should have kept it confidential until it finished its job,\u201d said Rep.

The measure was taken after American college student Otto Warmbier died after being released in a coma in June from a 17-month detention in North Korea. North Korea has denounced the US travel ban and has vowed to continue to leave the door open for Americans intending to visit the country. The North Korean move also suggests the country's continued efforts to source foreign currency through the foreign tourism industry amid tightening international sanctions on it.

Korean War veterans attend a ceremony in Seoul to mark the 63rd anniversary of the Armistice Agreement on July 27, 2016. (Yonhap)More than 3,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony, including Korean War veterans, their families, government officials and foreign diplomats in Seoul, it added.Two war veterans -- Boonchai Distakul of Thailand and Peter Seiersen of Canada -- will be awarded medals in recognition of their contributions to various programs on remembering the Korean War.A concert will be followed with the theme of \"Our Future Together.\"The Armistice Agreement was signed to end the Korean War. It has never been replaced by a peace treaty, meaning the two Koreas are still technically in a state of war.\u00a0 This year the South is stepping up efforts to improve inter-Korean relations.In his Berlin speech early this month, President Moon Jae-in proposed that the two Koreas stop all acts of hostility starting Armistice Agreement Day.Last week, the South offered formal talks with the North on reducing border tension and arranging family reunions.Pyongyang remains silent, however, amid news reports that it may soon make another provocative act.Meanwhile, the United National Command plans to hold a separate armistice anniversary event Thursday in the Joint Security Area at the truce village of Panmunjom.A total of 16 countries, including the United States, dispatched combat troops under the UN flag to help the South in the Korean War and five other nations sent medics.

(Yonhap)The North's development of SLBMs could pose a grave threat as it is hard to detect when and where they will be launched, making it difficult to seek a timely and effective response.\"Many experts said that it is necessary to build a nuclear submarine to better counter the North's threat\" a source said. \"A study is aimed at reviewing legal interpretations including international treaties and technical aspects.\"There are growing calls from government officials and politicians including Defense Minister Song Young-moo to push for building of a nuclear-powered sub.But some experts said that there may be restrictions in doing so, citing President Moon Jae-in's nuclear-focused energy-free policy and a nuclear pact between Seoul and Washington.The South Korean military reportedly has the capability to construct a small nuclear reactor for a nuke-powered submarine, but the problem lies in securing enriched uranium for fuel.A 2015 atomic energy pact between South Korea and the United States permits Seoul to make low-enriched uranium that can be used as fuel.Analysts said that as the deal allows Seoul to enrich uranium at a low level for a \"peaceful\" purposes, Washington would not give its consent to South Korea's possible move for a nuclear submarine.Moon Keun-sik, an expert at the Korea Defense and Security Forum, said that it is possible to buy uranium with 20 percent of enrichment levels being traded in markets.\"South Korea can push for building a nuclear submarine after reporting to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it has no plan to develop nuclear weapons,\" he claimed.North Korea last week released photos that indicates that it is developing what it called the underwater strategic Pukguksong-3 ballistic missile. Analysts estimated that the missile may be a new solid-fuel SLBM, which may have a range of 2,000-2,500 kilometers. (Yonhap)","916":"North Korea may be preparing for another ballistic missile test, possibly involving a submarine this time, media reports have suggested, raising concerns over further escalation of military tensions on the Korean Peninsula following a \u201cgame-changer\u201d missile test earlier this month.\u00a0 According to reports by NHK and CNN last week, US defense officials detected unusual activity of North Korea\u2019s Romeo-class submarine: It has been engaging in an underwater mission for a week after sailing some 100 kilometers out into waters between North Korea and Japan. The officials called it \u201cunusual deployment activity,\u201d saying the North\u2019s submarine usually returns to its base within four days and the Romeo-class often conducts missions near its home base in Sinpo, South Hamkyong Province. With the US and South Korea ratcheting up monitoring of the North after the July 4 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, analysts warned it could be an indication Pyongyang is preparing to fire off a submarine-based ballistic missile, such as a variant of the Pukguksong-1 that the regime successfully test-fired in August 2016. \u201cWhile there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that it is preparing for a test in the near future of an updated Pukguksong-1 (KN-11) submarine-launched ballistic missile or a potentially newer system,\u201d said 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea analysis.  North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. YonhapSome analysts have suggested the Romeo-class submarine could be engaged in an intelligence gathering operation for an underwater missile test, which could be carried out by 2000-ton Sinpo-class submarine the North used for the SLBM test last August.Citing its analysis of commercial satellite imagery from June 30 of the Sinpo shipyard, 38 North said North Korea has \u201crepositioned\u201d the Sinpo-class submarine capable of carrying an SLBM and submersible barge used for the August test.\u201cNorth Korea is likely to use the Sinpo-class submarine for an SLBM test,\u201d said Moon Geun-shik, a submarine expert and defense analyst at the Korea Defense and Security Forum. \u201cIn the meantime, the Romeo-class submarine could have been tasked with an intelligence-gathering mission in a remote sea.\u201d Regarded as the most advanced submarine developed by the North Korean navy, the Sinpo-class submarine would replace its Romeo-class submarine, which is thought to be unable to venture very far from its home port of Sinpo, the US and South Korea militaries suspect.Since the successful launch of the Pukguksong-1, North Korea has accelerated its effort to develop an advanced version of an SLBM. The Pukguksong-1 flew about 500 kilometers, marking the weapon\u2019s longest flight range. In May, the reclusive regime tested the SLBM\u2019s \u201ccold-launch system,\u201d a critical component for the missile, at the Sinpo shipyard. The technology uses high pressure steam to propel the missile out of the launch canister into the air before the missile\u2019s engines ignite. North Korea\u2019s submarines have posed grave security threats to South Korea following the 2010 Cheonan incident where a North Korean mini submarine torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel and killed 46 sailors.

(Yonhap)The fresh allegations, if confirmed, will likely add to the misdeeds of former President and dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who came to power through a military coup in late 1979.Chun has already been convicted of ordering an armed crackdown on thousands of democratic protesters in Gwangju, located some 330 kilometers southwest of Seoul, that left hundreds killed and thousands of others injured.The former dictator, however, has refused to admit his responsibility. In his autobiography, released in April, Chun again denied ordering the crackdown, while labeling the 1980 uprising a riot.A local court placed an injunction against the sale of Chun's book earlier this month, noting the book had distorted the accounts of facts and history.The Ministry of National Defense said it will soon create a task force to implement the president's instructions.\"We will form a special investigation team and conduct a special probe as soon as possible,\" the ministry's spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said in a statement. If related civic groups request participation in the probe, he added, the ministry will \"actively accept\" the offer.He said the ministry will do its best to find the truth behind the allegations through thorough investigation.Interpreting the historic event is a sensitive issue in the country.

It was shut down in February 2016 by Seoul's former conservative Park Geun-hye administration that sought to punish the communist state for its fourth nuclear test in the month before.During his presidential campaign, Moon advocated reconciliation with the North, including the resumption of joint projects under the right conditions.He, however, is currently focusing on what he calls \"maximum pressure and sanctions\" on North Korea following its continued provocations. North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test in September 2016 and 12 missile tests this year, including seven since Moon's May 10 inauguration.Still, the new South Korean president stresses the need to resume dialogue with the reclusive North, saying the final and sole objective of additional pressure and sanctions must be the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.

He also made clear that the ultimate aim would be the country's denuclearization.\"We need to see more on their part but I want to acknowledge the steps they've taken thus far. I think it's important to take note of that,\" stressed Tillerson.The peace gesture came just hours after the Treasury announced new sanctions on mainly Chinese and Russian entities and individuals with suspected ties to North Korea's nuclear program.Douglas Paal, vice president for studies for the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the two actions reflected the Trump administration's strategy of applying maximum economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime, and then creating room for engagement.Moreover, the administration was relieved North Korea did not go ahead with its earlier threats to launch ballistic missiles towards Guam, he noted in an email.\"I think Tillerson is trying to give Pyongyang a reason not to change course by offering talks,\" Paal said, pointing out the communist country has also refrained from carrying out provocations in protest of joint military exercises involving South Korean and US troops, which kicked off Monday.

This file photo taken on April 17, 2017 shows an Air Koryo aircraft as it sits parked in front of houses outside Pyongyang airport. (Yonhap-AFP)\u201cDue to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea\u2018s system of law enforcement, the Secretary has authorized a Geographical Travel Restriction on all U.S. citizen nationals\u2019 use of a passport to travel in, through, or to North Korea,\u201d State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement.The restriction will be announced in the Federal Register next week and take effect 30 days after the notice\u2018s publication.Those wishing to travel to the North for \u201ccertain limited humanitarian or other purposes\u201d will be required to apply for a special validation.The U.S. has previously warned its citizens against travel to North Korea, but it will be the first such ban.The measure comes as Congress pushes to prohibit Americans\u2019 travel to North Korea following the shocking detention and death of 22-year-old Warmbier.The University of Virginia student was arrested in the North in January last year for stealing a political propaganda sign from a hotel. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.Following his comatose release last month, Warmbier returned to his Ohio home but died several days later. North Korean officials claimed Warmbier fell into a coma in March last year due to botulism and a sleeping pill.

The government says the measure is part of a bigger plan to transform the Army into a more modernized force based on career military officers, but critics warn that it runs the risk of undermining the country\u2019s fundamental military capability, if confronted by the 1.2 million-strong North Korean Army. The two Koreas are still technically at war. President Moon on Wednesday unveiled a five-year plan to scale back the mandatory military service period to 18 months from the current 21, along with a separate scheme to reduce the number of armed forces to about 500,000 from 620,000.\u00a0 \u201cUnder the proposed reduction scheme, one South Korean solider is to fight against two or more North Korean soldiers during war,\u201d said Yang Uk, a senior researcher at the Seoul-based think tank Korea Defense Forum.The truce village of Panmunjom. YonhapCurrently, every Korean able-bodied man is mandated to serve in the military for 21 months for the Army, 23 months for the Navy and 24 months for the Air Force. The draftees can also choose to serve in the police for 21 months and the fire department for 23 months. The three-month cut would have wide ramifications for South Korea\u2019s defense against the belligerent North, as the conscriptable population is already shrinking, critics said. According to a projection by the military, the number of new draftees -- mostly in their 20s -- would fall from the current 350,000 to 250,000 by 2022, the final year of Moon\u2019s presidency and the five-year plan. A study by the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analysis shows that if the military service period is reduced by a month, the number of soldiers available for combat would decline by 10,000. A three-month reduction would lead to a shortage of about 33,000, the agency said. Some officials are worried that an 18-month service period would be too short for soldiers to master war training. \u201cApart from for the training period at boot camp, the soldiers would need at least nine months to be familiar with war skills. Under the current 21-month service period, only 10-20 percent of conscripts are considered to be fully combat-ready,\u201d said an Army officer, who declined to reveal his identity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Proponents argue that streamlining the military with the shorter service period is a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop playing games with numbers,\u201d said Lim Tae-hoon, head of the Center for Military Human Rights Korea. \u201cWe can recruit more noncommissioned officers with expertise and transform the reserve forces into a more developed, qualified one.\u201d Reducing the number of those enlisted and their service period was an election pledge of Moon, who led a similar scheme when he served as chief of staff for late President Roh Moo-hyun. The plan was scrapped under the tenure of conservative Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye. Yang of the Korea Defense Forum stressed that although the Army needs to be transformed and modernized, the number of armed forces still matters even in modern warfare. When the Iraq War broke out in 2003, \u201cthe US said they would win the war within months, but they were forced to withdraw due to the conflict on the ground. \u2026 Technology can play a big role in deterring war, but during actual warfare, the number of troops still matters,\u201d he said.\u00a0 By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","932":"More than 310,000 contract-based workers in the public sector are set to become permanent staff, the government said Thursday, setting in motion President Moon Jae-in\u2019s key election pledge to stabilize employment. The plan was approved at a Cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon. The scheme is designed to ease the criteria for full-time contracts to those who are expected to work for two years or longer, for at least nine months each year. Previously, it was eligible for people who had been working in their positions for at least two years and at least 10 months each year, and were to stay for another two years. The change will affect around 191,000 temporary workers and 120,000 people dispatched from service suppliers serving at 825 government and state-run institutions, the Ministry of Employment and Labor projected. They account for about 17 percent of the entire public sector workforce.\u201cThis is a guideline to give a general direction, and about 400 experts will be dispatched to provide custom-tailored consultations to each entity,\u201d Vice Labor Minister Yi Sung-ki said at a news conference after the meeting. \u201cAs the change could require a substantial amount of costs, we intend to focus on stabilizing employment for now and then move toward improving the employees\u2019 treatment later on. The cooperation with existing workers would also be necessary.\u201d\u00a0 Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon (third from right) presides over a Cabinet meeting on Thursday in Seoul. (Yonhap)The decision is in line with Moon\u2019s initiative to boost quality jobs and employment security amid a widening income gap and skyrocketing youth unemployment. He has vowed to generate some 800,000 permanent public sector positions and encourage the private sector to follow suit with incentives. In June, the jobless rate for those aged between 15 and 29 hit an 18-year high of 10.5 percent, with 63.8 percent of the total population engaged in economic activities, according to Statistics Korea. But the Moon administration faces challenges as the transition is likely to entail extra financial burdens, eating away resources that could otherwise be spent on new jobs for the youth. The ministry did not elaborate on its budgetary impact. Yi said the government has a \u201cbroad framework\u201d with regard to funding matters, but it will take shape after finalizing the number of employees that will switch to permanent ones. Under the plan, agencies are mandated to complete the change for fixed-term employees by the end of this year, and for dispatched ones no later than the due date of their respective contracts. It will be extended to other state-affiliated entities and public enterprises starting next year, and then some private organizations. Among the exemptions are staff for one-off projects including the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, those who are aged 60 or older, and specialists like sports players. But some senior citizens who have such professions as janitors and security guards may still benefit from the change, as employers are allowed to extend their retirement age up to 65.\u00a0 Non-regular workers pose at the Agriculture Ministry building within the Sejong government complex on Thursday. (Yonhap)Short-term teachers and English language instructors are subject to further consultations, for which the government will form a deliberation committee and gather opinions from stakeholders. The issue has given rise to a rift between temporary school instructors and those who passed the cutthroat national exam. An association of some 46,000 contract teachers expressed regret, arguing they should also be qualified for permanent employment. As for around 212,000 unlimited-term contract workers, the government will take steps to curb elimination and improve their benefits by adjusting their titles, expanding education and training and refurbishing personal management systems. Major labor lobbies largely praised the announcement. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions issued a statement, saying it demonstrated the administration\u2019s resolve to become a model employer, though the exception clause may be abused. The Federation of Korean Trade Unions also welcomed the decision but recommended the government to map out the specific time frame under which each step is intended to be executed.

Neither the US nor South Korea should shy away from bilateral talks with North Korea,\" he added.Negroponte, who also served as director of national intelligence and ambassador to the UN, suggested the long-suspended six-party denuclearization talks might be one of the most effective options in tackling the prolonged nuclear stalemate. (Yonhap)\"We need to have all the key regional players represented in any solution -- North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Russia, China and the US -- essentially the countries that were members of the six-party talks that took place in recent years,\" he said.\"I think the six-party format or something like that has much to command it in terms of assuring that all the most important regional interests are involved.\"The six-party talks started in 2003 to persuade the North to give up its nuclear aspirations but it has not been held since late 2008 when the North walked away from the negotiating table.North Korea conducted nuclear tests twice last year alone.

South Korea recently offered to hold inter-Korean military talks on Friday to ease tensions along the tense border and Red Cross talks on Aug. 1 to resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.

The invitation followed up Moon\u2019s Berlin initiative unveiled on July 6, under which he floated the idea of not only the military talks and family reunions but a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un \u201cat any time and any place, under the right conditions.\u201dThe Moon administration is apparently seeking to start by re-establishing idle communication channels through issues that appeal to Pyongyang, such as the propaganda broadcasts and flyers and then holding the family reunions, a more urgent matter to Seoul. The North severed the West Sea hotline in protest against the Park Geun-hye government\u2019s shutdown of the Kaesong factory park in February 2016. But three months later, Kim proposed military talks to defuse tension during the 7th Congress of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, followed by an official gesture by the People\u2019s Armed Forces through the channel. But the South brushed the suggestion off, demanding Pyongyang first take steps to denuclearize. If the communist state agrees, it would be the first inter-Korean military contact since October 2014.Yet even if it does, the prospects of the negotiations remain shaky given the gap in positions between the sides, observers say. Given the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d nature of the talks, the headstrong regime may also bring up South Korea-US joint military drills, the dispatch of US strategic assets, the deployment of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense here, and other issues from which Seoul could not budge.Or, even before the sides sit down across the table, they could spend days and weeks engaged in a heated war of nerves over the rank of each other\u2019s chief negotiator and protocol, which have in the past resulted in the breakdown of talks. The envisaged plan for family reunions faces its own daunting challenges. Kim Sun-hyang, acting president of the South\u2019s Red Cross, suggested a meeting with its northern counterpart on Aug. 1 at the Peace House, Panmunjom\u2019s southern conference building. The three-member delegation will be headed by the organization\u2019s secretary-general Kim Gunn-joong, she said, asking the North to reply via a cross-border Red Cross liaison. The two Koreas last held family reunions in October 2015. The relations, however, have only gone downhill since then, with Pyongyang continuing nuclear and missile provocations. Last month, Kim Yong-chol, a senior official in the North\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Unification of Korea in charge of inter-Korean affairs demanded in an interview that Seoul return 13 defectors as a precondition for family reunions. He singled out a group of 12 who fled while working at a North Korean restaurant in China last year, and Kim Ryon-hui, a defector who requested to go back to her homeland in 2015. The 13 were \u201cbeing detained by force in South Korea\u201d and without their immediate comeback, \u201cthere can never be any kind of humanitarian cooperation,\u201d Kim Yong-chol told the AFP in Pyongyang. The regime has been persistently insisting on their repatriation, saying they were kidnapped by the South Korean spy agency. Seoul has dismissed the claims, saying it has already verified the 12 waitresses\u2019 intentions to stay here, and Kim Ryon-hui had already become a South Korean and therefore is mandated to secure government approval to visit the North, with the only possibility for a temporary stay.\u201cToday\u2019s proposal was a step to ease tension and establish peace in the initial phase (of the new administration) while resolving the pressing matters like the separated families,\u201d Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said at a separate news conference. \u201cThere could be issues each side may raise, but we will settle our position in detail according to the North\u2019s response,\u201d he added, when asked on the North\u2019s demand for the defectors\u2019 return.

The amending procedures should also be led by the people, not by a specific authority or political factions,\u201d National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun said, opening the debate. National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun delivers a congratulatory address at the senior politician debate on constitutional reform at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)He also urged the parliament to ensure that the revision be carried out smoothly in order to be completed by next year.\u00a0\u201cWe should motion the revision bill next March, put it to a parliamentary vote in May and make sure the referendum is run smoothly on June 13, on the sidelines of the local elections,\u201d Chung said. Calls have risen for reform of the Constitution last amended 30 years ago, in 1987. It was promulgated on July 17, 1948. President Moon Jae-in has vowed to complete the revision and conduct a referendum on it for June 13 next year, when the nation goes to polls for local elections. Participating in Monday\u2019s debate were five former assembly speakers: Kim Won-ki, Kim Hyung-o, Park Kwan-yong, Lim Chae-jung and Chung Ui-hwa. Former President of the Constitutional Court Lee Kang-kuk and former Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo were also present.The debate mainly revolved around the need for the revision and the need to better reflect the views of citizens to enhance their quality of life. They also talked about ways to disperse authority with the country\u2019s \u201cimperial presidency,\u201d suggesting ideas such as reinforcing the decentralization system and different forms of government. Former speaker Kim Hyung-o contended that the current presidential system gives the president too many powers and that it does not fit the nation\u2019s principle of separating legislative, administrative and judicial powers. \u201cThe president and the administration have excessive power compared to the parliament and Supreme Court. But the system to watch over their powers has not been developed,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTo disperse the president\u2019s authority, we should pursue a different form of government such as a semipresidential system.\u201dKim also criticized the current single-term, five-year presidency, saying it leads to the government\u2019s failure to come up with long-term visions for the country. That goes in line with what President Moon had suggested -- to revise the law to implement a double-term, four-year presidency. Park voiced concerns over how a semipresidential system would be able to completely separate the duties of the president and prime minister. He also added that they need a thorough review of each suggestion.\u201cI also want to stress that it is important to match the time of the presidential and general elections, because its mismatch leads to a lot of confusion,\u201d Park said.\u00a0 Senior politicians pose for camera in a debate on Constitutional reform at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Mindful of the four political parties constantly clashing over state affairs, Kim Won-ki highlighted the importance of cooperation among lawmakers. \u201cWe now know political reform is impossible without the fundamental law changed to properly reflect the current society,\u201d Kim said. For the constitutional revision to pass the parliament, more than two-thirds of the 299-member parliament should vote to pass it. A special committee on constitutional reform, consisting of 36 lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties, kicked off at the National Assembly on Jan. 5 to review the Constitution and come up with a common reformation proposal. A political reform panel with 13 lawmakers was also set up in late June to motion bills to make improvements in the electoral system. While the consensus is that a constitutional amendment is needed, opinions are divided over the details.Lim, who focused his speech on the need for revision of the law, underlined that the demand comes from the people. He referred to how previous attempts to revise the Constitution were only means to maintain regimes. Big changes were made twice to the Constitution before 1987, in which the reform drives were promoted unilaterally under dictator regimes: Syngman Rhee in 1954 and Park Chung-hee in 1972, the father of ousted former President Park Geun-hye. \u201cThis time, the demand for change comes from the people. It will be the people, the masters of the Constitution, who lead the revision,\u201d he said. According to a poll released Sunday by Korea Research, 75.4 percent of 1,000 respondents said they agree with revising the Constitution, while 72.8 percent also said the reform would help enhance their quality of life. In the same poll, 79.8 percent said that presidential power should be dispersed, while the law should reinforce a decentralized system. On the preferred forms of government, 46 percent supported a semipresidential system in which the president is elected by a national vote to focus on foreign policies while the prime minister is elected by the parliament to look over domestic affairs. The current presidency system followed in the list with 38.2 percent, while 13 percent of respondents said they prefer a parliamentary government. Constitution Day was previously designated as a national holiday in 1950, but it was eliminated from the list of holidays in 2008.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)","946":"The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae has discovered additional documents from the former administration that potentially incriminate the ousted former President Park Geun-hye and her top aides, a Cheong Wa Dae official said Monday.The additional documents were found in a file cabinet located in the office of the presidential secretary for political affairs, according to Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun. Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun (Yonhap)The announcement came three days after the presidential office said it found over 300 documents from an office previously occupied by the presidential secretary for civil affairs under the former Park Geun-hye administration, some of which suggested the former leader may have sought to support what could have been an illegal inheritance of wealth by Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of Samsung Group.The 1,361 new documents mostly contain the outcomes of weekly meetings of presidential secretaries chaired by the chief of staff between March 2015 and November 2016.Some of the 254 documents that have been reviewed contained orders from the former chief of staff, according to Park.\"They have to do with Samsung and the blacklist of cultural figures,\" he said in a press briefing.The documents may help incriminate former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon, who is facing trial on suspicion of managing the so-called blacklist of cultural figures deemed critical of the former administration, an allegation currently denied by Kim.The documents also contained Kim's orders for using the media in dealing with various issues, including the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry and the controversial deal with Japan over the latter's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II, Park said.\"They include unlawful orders related to the agreement over sexual slaves, the Sewol ferry, state-authored history textbooks and elections,\" he said.The documents, once sorted, will likely be handed over to the special counsel and the prosecution, currently seeking to prosecute the former president and her aides on various charges including bribery and influence peddling.

The exhibit, titled \u201cInvisible Language,\u201d is a collaboration of the diplomatic mission, the Central Bank of Turkey and the Bank of Korea. Works spanning two centuries were selected from the Central Bank of Turkey\u2019s art collection by curator Ahmet Albayrak for the event, which runs through Sept. 3 at the Bank of Korea\u2019s Money Museum.\u201cThis exhibition is one of the most outstanding activities that we are organizing within the context of the 2017 Turkey Korea Culture Year here,\u201d said Turkish Ambassador to Korea Arslan Hakan Okcal in a speech at the opening ceremony on July 10. \u201cThe 30 artworks presented are just a small token of the vast collection of the Central Bank of Turkey, the custodian of our rich and diverse artifacts, particularly modern paintings.\u201dThe 60th anniversary marks a milestone in both countries, the envoy added, noting Turkey and Korea have celebrated the occasion from the lunar calendar. \u201cOur relations actually have a much longer history than our diplomatic ties,\u201d he highlighted, explaining Turks trace their roots to Asia and were neighbors with ancient Koreans in Manchuria, then occupied by peoples of Turkey\u2019s Gokturk and Korea\u2019s Goguryeo kingdoms. \u201cThat may be why we both belong to the Ural-Altaic language family and have strikingly similar cultural sensibilities.\u201dThe ancient Turks traversed westward and settled some 1,000 years ago in Anatolia, the land where coins were first minted and used by ancient Lidyans, the ambassador explained. He also said the Turks and Koreans continued to maintain commerce and correspondence through the ancient Silk Road.The two countries\u2019 ancient ties became even more solid during the 1950-53 Korean War, to which Turkey dispatched 21,212 troops to defend against the North Korean invasion. The Turkish Brigade fought some of the bloodiest battles and lost over 1,000 soldiers, the third-highest casualty rate among participating nations under the United Nations Command.Turkish soldiers also undertook emergency care and social relief work during the war, and opened the Ankara School for orphans of the conflict, which operated into the late 1960s. \u201cOur soldiers\u2019 selfless sacrifices and actions forged a special bond between us,\u201d Okcal underscored. \u201cI am very proud that their sacrifices and contributions during and after the war have never been forgotten by the noble Korean people. Today we consider each other \u2018brother nations\u2019 as well as \u2018blood brothers.\u2019\u201dIn recent years, the bilateral relations have strengthened to a strategic partnership, and diversified over comprehensive areas, according to the diplomat. Turkey and Korea are influential partners in their respective regions and beyond, and closely cooperate through the Group of 20, MIKTA -- a middle power alliance of Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Australia -- and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where their central banks collaborate on diverse economic issues.

The embassy is scheduled to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of official South Korea-China diplomatic ties with an event on Thursday at a Seoul hotel. This file photo shows South Korean and Chinese officials attending a reception at a Seoul hotel on Aug. 24, 2017, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries. (Yonhap)South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha plans to leave for Russia on the same day for a meeting with her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov set for Friday in Moscow, without attending the embassy function.The spokesman said that the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministers will send a message of congratulations on the occasion of the anniversary.The relatively subdued festivity this year compares with the countries' marking of their 20th anniversary in 2012 when then-South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan attended a similar Chinese Embassy event in Seoul.A government source said Kang's absence has nothing to do with the current bilateral feud as her visit to Russia had already been set up, but the ongoing friction apparently seems to be playing a part.Diplomatic ties between the two neighboring countries have been put to the test as the two remain staunchly at odds over the ongoing installation of a US missile defense system in South Korean territory. In July last year, South Korea and the US unveiled their plan to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, saying that it is intended to better defend against missiles from North Korea.China has adamantly opposed the move, claiming it is part of the US missile defense network and its powerful X-band radar, in particular, will hurt its strategic security interests. The source also said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is unlikely to attend the anniversary event organized by the South Korean Embassy in Beijing. It is still unknown who will represent China at the event, the source said.In 2012, then-Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi attended the embassy event in Beijing. Xi and Yang are now the country's president and state councilor.

We need creativity and I think that will be something that would be helpful,\" he said.Secondary sanctions, also known as \"secondary boycott,\" are considered one of the last-remaining sanctions tools against the North, and call for penalizing companies doing business with Pyongyang. Chinese firms are expected to be subject to the measure as most of the North's dealings with the outside world are with China.Former US President Barack Obama was reluctant to impose secondary sanctions out of fear of souring relations with China.But his successor, Donald Trump, is widely expected to pursue those measures as he has been strongly critical of Beijing for not helping resolve the North Korea problem.China is North Korea's last-remaining major ally and a key provider of food and fuel supplies. But it has been reluctant to use its influence over Pyongyang for fears that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and hurt Chinese national interests.Beijing has often increased pressure on the North in the past, especially when Pyongyang defied international appeals and carried out nuclear and missile tests and other provocative acts, but it never went as far as to cause real pain to the North.Lee Jung-hoon, Seoul's ambassador for North Korean human rights issues, said that China's retaliation against South Korea for hosting the US THAAD missile defense system served as a \"wakeup call\" for South Koreans' perceptions about the neighboring nation.\"This THAAD issue and the Chinese response to this is allowing us to see China for what it really is, just as in the case of North Korea. It is certainly not well becoming of a country that wants to be a global leader,\" Lee said during the AEI discussion.\"We have to deal with this kind of China. It's sort of a wakeup call. Let's not have a fantasy to think that somehow we can gain Chinese cooperation to rein in on North Korean situation,\" he said.South Korea decided last year to host a THAAD battery to boost defenses against North Korea.China has taken a number of economic retaliatory measures, including restrictions on South Korean imports and a ban on Chinese tourists from visiting the neighboring nation, as Seoul refused to give in Chinese pressure to scrap the decision to host THAAD.

Now nearing the end of his tenure, the envoy says he has developed an \u201cintimate feel\u201d of the Korean people and culture, which helped achieve concrete results in diplomacy and business. \u201cKorea was my first diplomatic post in Northeast Asia, and I quickly found out upon arriving that our relations were not moving with a strong momentum,\u201d he told The Korea Herald last week ahead of the Pakistani National Day reception in Seoul on Thursday. \u201cIt was hard creating the momentum, but after three years, I am happy that we have enhanced cooperation in various areas and are working to upgrade the relationship to a strategic level.\u201d\u00a0Pakistani Ambassador to Korea Zahid Nasrullah Khan (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)A career diplomat for 30 years, Khan had been posted to Berne, Switzerland, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, London and Doha, Quatar before Seoul. He will be Pakistan\u2019s top envoy to Afghanistan after Korea, a weighty post considering the myriad of complicated issues between the two countries. Under Khan\u2019s ambassadorship, the Korea Eximbank has increased its Economic Development Cooperation Fund from $180 million to $500 million for collaboration in various sectors through 2018. A tangible fruit under the fund is a project building an information technology park in Islamabad, an $88 million venture modeled after Pangyo Techno Valley in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. \u201cIn my discussions with the Eximbank executives and Korean diplomats, I told them they are doing a lot of projects building hospitals, roads and tunnels, but none of them stands out as a landmark that Pakistanis can always look to and identify with Korea,\u201d the envoy said. \u201cThis park, which will act as the hub of all information technology activities in Pakistan, is something that all Pakistanis will identify with Korea.\u201d Construction will be finished by 2018 if all goes to schedule, and the facility will be a hotbed of innovation for Pakistan\u2019s technologically savvy entrepreneurs and young people, the ambassador noted.\u00a0Pakistani Ambassador to Korea Zahid Nasrullah Khan during the National Day reception at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Thursday (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)Khan also assisted Korean companies\u2019 investments in constructing hydroelectric power plants in Pakistan.

Islamabad and Seoul established diplomatic relations in 1983. The two countries will launch the first round of negotiations this year for a prospective bilateral free trade agreement. As the two economies are complementary -- with Pakistan largely focusing on manufacturing of textiles, yarn, metals, agri-food and meat, and Korea producing value-added goods -- prospects for an early conclusion of talks are high, according to Khan. There are 11,000 Pakistanis living in Korea, the country\u2019s third-largest diaspora in East and Southeast Asia, following Malaysia and Thailand. They are involved in business and exchanges through the employment permit system and university programs. Some 2,800 Pakistanis are married to Koreans.

Thirdly, I will work on the respectful return of 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan to their homeland.\u201d By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","956":"Despite a series of unresolved mysteries surrounding his assassination, the remains of Kim Jong-nam appear to be set for a cremation and return to the homeland he had been unable to visit for years. Malaysian and Japanese news reports said Monday that the body of Kim, the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was transferred to a crematorium outside Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, and the remains will be handed over to Pyongyang envoys who are visiting the country for secret talks with Malaysian authorities.A Malaysian policeman controls traffic outside the forensics wing of Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where the body of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un, lies in Kuala Lumpur on Monday. (AFP-Yonhap)China Press, a Malaysian Chinese-language newspaper, said four police officers visited the North Korean Embassy for 2 1\/2 hours on Sunday to question three suspects staying within the compound. They are Hyon Kwang-song, a second secretary at the mission; Kim Uk-il, a Koryo Air employee; and Ri Ji-u, all of whom are suspected of having played a role in Kim\u2019s murder. While at least five suspects had already fled or been deported to their home country, the North Korean authorities have been protecting the trio, refusing to cooperate with the probe. Kim was killed last month shortly after VX nerve agent was smeared on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Two women, each from Vietnam and Indonesia, have been arrested for carrying out the attack. North Korea and Malaysia have been at loggerheads, as Pyongyang opposed Kim\u2019s autopsy and called for a handover of his body. They have ousted each other\u2019s ambassadors and scrapped a visa-free travel accord. Pyongyang also barred Malaysians from leaving the country, prompting Kuala Lumpur to expel North Koreans from its soil.With their ties quickly deteriorating, the two countries have been engaged in closed-door negotiations since early this month. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Hui-chol and former Deputy Ambassador to the UN Ri Dong-il took part in a meeting Friday, according to Japanese broadcaster ANN. Sunday\u2019s expected cremation is believed to be part of their settlement, along with the officers\u2019 visit. For Malaysia, the case has been a domestic and international political burden, with nine of its nationals being locked in the communist state, while its investigation has hit a snag in the face of an uncooperative Pyongyang. But the latest development stoked controversy as it will likely leave many questions unanswered over Kim\u2019s death. Malaysian authorities have failed to confirm that North Korea was the mastermind behind the assassination, though they did present some evidence suggesting it. Pyongyang argues he died from \u201cnatural causes,\u201d accusing Malaysia of manipulating the investigation. The discussions are \u201congoing\u201d but a decision should be reached \u201cvery soon,\u201d Malaysian Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam was quoted by Malaysia\u2019s New Straits Times as saying early Monday, adding that the investigation will continue regardless of the agreement.

The Sewol ferry sits on a semisubmersible vessel in waters off Jindo, South Jeolla Province, Sunday. (Yonhap)A joint team of workers from the South Korean government and the Chinese firm Shanghai Salvage are currently working to drain the water and oil from the ferry after it was safely loaded onto a semisubmersible transport vessel Saturday.The drainage work is expected to be finished by Tuesday, he said.Then, it will take an additional two days to fix key parts of the ferry so it can be made ready for transport.Lee said a search for the bodies of nine missing people whose remains could still be inside the wreck will begin once the ship arrives at the port of Mokpo.Also, divers will search carefully for any remains left in the water and on the sea floor, where the Sewol sank, starting in early April, according to the official. Authorities said underwater fences surrounding the area where the Sewol sank have already been set up.A special law to launch a fact-finding board will likely be passed by parliament on Tuesday that will allow experts to determine the exact cause of the sinking.It will be comprised of eight experts, including Kong Gil-young, a professor at the Korean Maritime and Ocean University, and Jang Beom-seon, a professor from Seoul National University. Of those sitting on the board, five will be recommended by political parties and three by the bereaved family members.When the ferry is placed on a dry dock at the port of Mokpo around April 4, the board will begin its task of going through every aspect of the tragedy for the next 10 months, according to the government.A total of 304 people, most of whom were high school students on a school trip, died when the ferry sank on April 16, 2014, with investigators concluding that the sinking was a man-made disaster.Nine bodies are still missing.The operation to lift the sunken ferry, lying 40 meters underwater for nearly three years, began Wednesday on a tight schedule as it had to be carried out during the neap tide period, which ended Friday at midnight.The ill-fated ship was pulled out of the water with two giant barges that hoisted up the 6,800-ton hull and moved it to the semisubmersible ship, which will carry the Sewol to shore.In 2015, in order to recover the bodies of people still missing and conduct a detailed investigation into the disaster, the South Korean government decided to pull the ferry out of the water intact.The 85.1 billion won ($72 million) project went to a Chinese consortium led by state-run Shanghai Salvage.

Whether Park will be taken into custody now depends on the Seoul Central District Court, which will hold a hearing at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday to review the application. The ruling is expected early Friday.Former President Park Geun-hye arrived at the prosecutors' office on Feb. 21 to be questioned over a string of corruption allegations. (Yonhap)\u201cThe case is too serious, as the suspect has abused her status and authority as a president to receive money from companies, violated the freedom of business activity and leaked confidential information related to the government,\u201d the prosecution said in a statement. \u201cIt would be unfair not to request a warrant considering that her accomplice Choi Soon-sil, as well as those government officials who followed her orders and the ones who offered her kickbacks have all been detained.\u201d Key figures involved in the scandal, including her longtime confidante Choi, former presidential aides, ex-ministers and Samsung Group\u2019s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, have been arrested and are standing trial. Park has denied all the charges, claiming no knowledge of any illegal activities by Choi and her inner circle. The request for the arrest writ came six days after the prosecution questioned the impeached president for 14 straight hours on a total of 13 charges.She is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won ($69.6 million) from local firms including Samsung Group for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. Park\u2019s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against liberal-leaning artists. The most controversial charge is bribery, a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or a term of more than 10 years.Prosecutor-General Kim Soo-nam (Yonhap)While the prosecution viewed local firms as victims of Park\u2019s extortion of donations, an independent counsel saw Park as an active player in the bribery scheme involving Choi and Samsung Group. The independent counsel suspected that Samsung Group offered or promised to offer funds totaling 43.3 billion won to Choi and her business interests in return for the Park administration\u2019s backing of a 2014 merger of its two affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the smooth transfer of power from the ailing group Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. Park was expelled from power on March 10, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term, in a unanimous decision by the Constitutional Court to finalize the Dec. 9 parliamentary impeachment. The ruling stripped her of the immunity that had shielded her from criminal investigation.South Korea\u2019s liberal parties welcomed the decision, while the former ruling party expressed regret. \u201cRequesting an arrest warrant for Park on charges of bribery and others is a historic decision. It is a reasonable conclusion, given the law and principles,\u201d said Youn Kwan-seuk, spokesperson for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea in a briefing. The centrist People\u2019s Party showed its expectation for the court to issue the warrant, praising the prosecution for showing that the law does not yield to power.The conservative and pro-Park Liberty Korea Party, however, said through a statement that \u201cit is very regrettable for the party which had been hoping for an investigation without detention.\u201dThe smaller conservative Bareun Party also expressed regret about the \u201cunfortunate history\u201d of the nation\u2019s presidents being arrested after leaving the office. But it said, \u201cWe hope this is a chance to remind ourselves of the spirit of liberal democracy that nobody is an exception before the law and principle.\u201dIf the writ is issued, she will become the nation\u2019s third former president to be arrested, following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","959":"Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party remained the front-runner in South Korea's presidential race for the 12th consecutive week, a poll showed Monday.The former opposition leader gained 34.4 percent last week, down 2.2 percentage points from the previous week, according to the survey by Realmeter.The decline was possibly due to voter backlash over increased mudslinging among the party's four contenders, the pollster said.

Former US nuclear negotiator with North Korea Christopher Hill (Yonhap)\"We say 'everything is on the table' is because basically none of the options are particularly good options,\" the former negotiator said on New York's AM 970 radio, according to the newspaper Hill. \"There are no good military options.\"We've done a lot on sanctions. It's the most sanctioned country in the world. That hasn't worked. We tried to have negotiations with them. That hasn't worked. But I think what could work is a much better understanding between the US and China,\" Hill said.He expressed concerns about the rapidly worsening threats from the North.\"In the last few years, North Korea's threat has really grown ... now we are seeing them modernize their missile arsenal, such that it's quite likely in the near future ... North Korea will have a deliverable nuclear weapon. And then the question is, what are we all going to do about that?\" Hill said.\"I wouldn't want to be Donald Trump in 2020 and have to say ... we couldn't do anything,\" he said.Hill, who also served as ambassador to South Korea, said that beefing up the defense of South Korea and increasing cooperation with Beijing are the best ways to deal with the North's threats.\"We are going to have to thicken up our defense of South Korea ... and I think we are going to have to really work more with China,\" he said.That's in line with the point US President Donald Trump has long made.The Trump administration has made it a key priority to get China to exercise more leverage as the main energy and food provider for North Korea to rein in the provocative regime. Trump has long said that North Korea is China's problem to fix.China is North Korea's last-remaining major ally and a key provider of food and fuel supplies. But it has been reluctant to use its influence over Pyongyang for fears that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and hurt Chinese national interests.Beijing has often increased pressure on the North in the past, especially when Pyongyang defied international appeals and carried out nuclear and missile tests and other provocative acts, but it never went as far as to cause real pain to the North.

(Yonhap)Seven senators co-sponsored the resolution, including Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Cory Gardner (R-CO).Sneddon, then a college student from Utah, disappeared in China in 2004.

Attorneys said he could be released from a Wisconsin detention center as early as Monday.Judge Samuel Cole issued a 13-page decision Friday, more than two weeks after Yee\u2019s closed-door hearing on the asylum application.\u201cYee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore,\u201d Cole wrote.Yee left Singapore with the intention of seeking asylum in the US after being jailed for several weeks in 2015 and 2016. He was accused of hurting the religious feelings of Muslims and Christians in the multiethnic city-state. Yee is an atheist. Many of his blog and social media posts criticized Singapore\u2019s leaders. He created controversy in 2015 as the city-state was mourning the death of its first prime minister and he posted an expletive-laden video about Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew just after his death.Such open criticism of political leaders is discouraged in Singapore. The case raised questions about free speech and censorship and has been closely watched abroad.Cole said testimony during Yee\u2019s hearing showed that while the Singapore government\u2019s stated reason for punishing him involved religion, \u201cits real purpose was to stifle Yee\u2019s political speech.\u201d He said Yee\u2019s prison sentence was \u201cunusually long and harsh\u201d especially for his age.Officials at Singapore\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C., have not addressed the case and messages left for the government on Saturday morning in Singapore weren\u2019t immediately returned.The ruling was praised by others.\u201cI think this is a major embarrassment for the government, that all along claimed Amos\u2019 persecution was not political,\u201d Kenneth Jeyaretnam, an opposition politician who gave testimony supporting Yee\u2019s asylum, told The Associated Press.Jeyaretnam said the decision \u201cmay create waves in Singapore.

Among voters in their 50s, his approval slipped 5.1 points to 28.9 percent; among voters aged 60 and over, his support fell 4.5 points to 37.3 percent; while among conservatives, his rating declined 9.2 points to 25.1 percent.Ahn's camp attributed the fall to the candidate's apparent focus on attacking his rivals during the third presidential TV debate held Sunday.\"Sunday's debate was a fatal blow,\" an official of his campaign told Yonhap News Agency on the condition of anonymity. \"He didn't come across positively in the debate, which led the (southeastern) Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province to turn their backs on him, while the (liberal stronghold) Honam seems to demonstrate a bandwagon effect (in Moon's favor).\"Ahn, a former software mogul and co-founder of his party, \"fought well\" in the fourth TV debate on Tuesday, but its effect has yet to be reflected in opinion surveys, the official added.Meanwhile, Moon maintained his lead for the 17th consecutive week. He also led in all regions except the northeastern province of Gangwon and in all age groups except voters aged 60 and over.\u00a0\u00a0 Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party stood in third place with 13 percent, up 2.5 points from last week. Sim Sang-jeung of the minor progressive Justice Party climbed 2.9 points to 7.5 percent, her personal record. Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party also posted a personal record of 5.4 percent after gaining 0.5 point.Hong absorbed more of the conservative vote, rising 6.3 points to 18.3 percent among voters in their 50s, 6.4 points to 27.6 percent among voters aged 60 and over, and 8 points to 38.5 percent among conservatives.He may have benefited from the last presidential debate during which he expressed a negative view of homosexuality and cited former strongman Park Chung-hee as his role model, both of which could have struck a chord with conservatives.Sim and Yoo have also received praise for their eloquent and professional delivery during the debates.The survey was conducted on 1,520 voters nationwide and has a margin of error of 2.5 points at a 95 percent confidence level.

Part of the rusted Sewol ferry resurfaces above the sea off the southwestern island Jindo on March 24, 2017, three years after it capsized and killed over 300 people, with nine still missing. (Yonhap)Two salvage barges on Thursday raised the 145-meter-long, 6,825-ton ship that had been lying about 40 meters under water, some three years after it capsized off the southwest coast of the peninsula near the island of Jindo, while en route to the resort island of Jeju on April 16, 2014. Its sinking, the worst maritime disaster in the country's history, left 304 people dead, with nine of them still missing.After the team removes the ramp, the final leg of the salvaging process should gain speed, which involves loading the ship onto a semisubmersible vessel and transporting it to a nearby port in Mokpo. This process needs to be completed by midnight when the neap tide is expected to end. The next neap is not until April 5.\u00a0 The government said it has so far hoisted the upper part of the hull some 12 meters above sea level, with one more meter to go as they need to raise it 13 meters for a safe loading onto the semisubmersible ship.\u00a0 Efforts to lift the Sewol started early Wednesday following several hours of careful examination of the weather conditions because the sea must be fairly calm.It will take about eight days to lift the ship and move it to port, and then take an additional four days to move it onto a dry dock, the ministry said.

Peter Roskam (R-IL) and Ami Bera (D-CA), noting that such retaliatory measures could constitute a violation of its World Trade Organization obligations.(Yonhap)\"The House of Representatives condemn China's retaliatory measures against the Republic of Korea, its businesses and its people in response to the deployment of the THAAD to protect against North Korea,\" the resolution said, urging Beijing to \"immediately cease its diplomatic intimidation and economic coercion\" against the South.The resolution calls on China to \"exercise its considerable influence to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs instead of undermining South Korea's sovereign right to defend itself against the North Korean threat.\"South Korea decided last year to host a THAAD battery to boost defense against North Korea.China has taken a number of economic retaliatory measures, including restrictions on South Korean imports and a ban on Chinese tourists from visiting the neighboring nation, as Seoul refused to give in Chinese pressure to scrap the decision to host THAAD.The resolution noted that \"no less than 50 Lotte supermarkets across China had been shut down and the Korean businesses located across China have been the target of various inspections by the Chinese authorities\" after the Lotte Group conglomerate decided to hand over a golf course for the THAAD site.It said that an American company partnering with Lotte has also been directly affected by such measures. The resolution also noted that Chinese authorities have instructed travel agencies not to sell any tour packages to South Korea and that China canceled numerous cultural shows and music performances planned under contracts with South Korean firms.\"China's retaliatory measures against South Korea potentially constitutes a violation of its World Trade Organization obligations,\" the resolution said, calling those measures \"unacceptable.\"The resolution also condemns the North's recent ballistic missile launches and urges the US to take all necessary measures to protect itself and allies while expressing support for the prompt deployment of THAAD and praising South Korea for its commitment to the system's deployment.\"With the upcoming visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to the United States, it is important, through this resolution, that we support the timely deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea and urge China to cease its unwarranted retaliation against South Korea in response to the deployment,\" Yoho said in a separate statement.The congressman stressed that China has done little to rein in the North's provocative actions.\"I commend the Korean government for its firm commitment and timely cooperation to ensure the effective deployment of THAAD. I also want to express my gratitude for the service and sacrifice of our 28,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that constitute the US Forces Korea and who so honorably defend the US-ROK alliance against any and all North Korean aggression,\" he said.

(Yonhap file photo)In the 2012 presidential election, some 220,000 overseas voters registered out of 2.2 million eligible citizens. Among them, 158,235 citizens cast their ballots. Thursday\u2019s number cannot serve as a barometer yet, but it reflects a surge in people\u2019s attention to this year\u2019s presidential election, which was brought forward as former President Park Geun-hye was ousted from office in a first since the Constitution-based administration began in 1948 in the nation. The registration period for overseas voters is much shorter for the upcoming May 9 election, 21 days, starting from March 10. It was 91 days for the 2012 election.\u201cWe cannot compare the numbers now because the registration period is still ongoing. But as we have more than a week left until its close, and diplomatic offices are stepping up their promotion, we expect the figure to go up,\u201d a Foreign Ministry official told The Korea Herald.The high turnout rate is also because internet registration has been allowed for the first time, the official added. On March 11, some 23,304 overseas Koreans registered as electorate -- seven times higher than the corresponding figure for the last presidential election in 2012, according to the national election committee.The Korean Consulate General in Sydney, Australia, also revealed Thursday that more than 4,891 Korean national residents have registered as of 3 p.m. on Wednesday, which shows a 43 percent increase compared to the last presidential election.

The real estate, lodging, restaurants and several other industries will suffer the most with the application of the proposed bill across the board, the Korea Economic Research Institute said in a report.The think tank said a strict 52-hour workweek can be applied to the education, finance, insurance and utility industries without creating any additional work hours.The report said, that because some sectors will be affected more, lawmakers need to take into consideration specific characteristics of different industries.It rebuffed the assumption that any reduction in work hours will automatically lead to an increase in employment.\"The labor market in our country is so rigid that any cuts in work hours will only result a decrease in production rather than additional employment,\" the report said. \"In the long term, simple manual laborers might be replaced by machines.\" (Yonhap)","974":"WASHINGTON -- A US THAAD missile defense battery being installed in South Korea will become operational \"in the coming days,\" the US Pacific commander said Wednesday.Adm.

So I must assume that Kim Jong-un's nuclear claims are true. I know his aspirations certainly are.

Still, he said, the US goal is to bring the North's leader to \"his senses, not to his knees.\" Pressed for preemptive strike options, the commander said the US has \"a lot of pre-emptive options\" against the North, but declined to elaborate in an open hearing.Harris also called for putting missile interceptors in Hawaii in addition to those in Alaska and California.\"The interceptors that we have the defend our homeland directly in Alaska and California are critical. I have suggested that we consider putting interceptors in Hawaii that defend Hawaii directly and that we look at the defensive Hawaii radar to improve Hawaii's capability,\" he said.Asked what the North could do militarily against US assets in the region or allies, Harris said anything could be possible, including previous types of provocations, such as the 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and the artillery attack on the island of Yeonpyeong.Harris apologized for the confusion over the whereabouts of the Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson that had been reported to be heading to waters off the Korean Peninsula to deter the North when it was actually moving in the opposite direction.\"That's my fault on the confusion and I'll take the hit for it. I made the decision to pull the Carl Vinson out of Singapore, truncate the exercise that it was going to do south of Singapore, cancel the support visit to Australia and then proceed north,\" he said.\"Where I failed was to communicate that adequately to the press and the media. That is all on me but we've done exactly that. We pulled out of Singapore, truncated the exercise, cancelled the port visit and then moved it north. Today, it sits in the Philippines Sea just east of Okinawa in striking range and power projection range of North Korea if called upon to do that.\"Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump said he sent an \"armada\" to Korea.

(Yonhap)According to the data by local environmental authorities, scholars and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the yearly cost of South Korea's air pollution is estimated to hover above the 10 trillion won mark.Prof. Bae Jeong-hwan of Chonnam National University in Gwangju, about 330 kilometers south of Seoul, even put the figure at 11.8 trillion won.The estimates measured the harmful effects of such air pollutants as particulates, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides.\"According to conservative estimates, the damage from air pollution in South Korea hovers in the 10 trillion won range, but it could become much larger considering its ripple effects on consumption and industrial activity,\" Bae said. \"It also has a negative impact on the quality of life.\"Spewed out by power stations, plants and cars, particulates, also called fine dust, refer to microscopic solids and droplets that are known to cause various respiratory problems while also affecting the body's immune system.According to the OECD, South Korea has the worst air pollution among its member countries. In a report released last year, the Paris-based club of advanced economies predicted South Korea to suffer the biggest economic damage and the highest premature death rate from air pollution among its members in 2060.Air pollution is estimated to cost South Korea $20 billion that year, which will wipe 0.63 percent off its economic growth rate, the highest among its member nations, the OECD said.Some local experts pointed out that the damage from air pollution could be larger that the conservative estimates, given fine dust and yellow dost that originate in China and grip South Korea nearly every spring.Meanwhile, a series of international reports have recently been released, pointing to the serious level of South Korea's air pollution. Seoul ranked No. 3 among large cities worldwide in terms of air pollution on Tuesday.

And it will require four additional days to move it onto a dry dock,\" the spokesman said. Before committing to raising the ship, the ferry was carefully test lifted one meter from the sea bottom at 3:30 p.m. so experts could see if the vessel was ready to be raised, the ministry said. The hull had been left at a depth of some 40 meters for nearly three years since it sank off the country's southwestern coast near Jindo Island in April 2014. The sinking, the country's worst maritime disaster, left more than 300 people dead, mostly high school students on a school excursion. Nine of them still remain missing. The ministry said salvage workers carried out balancing procedures first before committing themselves to pulling the hull out of the water. It said all technical aspects and local weather conditions were reviewed. Divers also checked the underwater situation to make certain that the operation will go smoothly. The complete lifting and transportation of the vessel to port is expected to be an arduous process and require good weather conditions, officials said. The hull itself should break the water's surface in the early hours of Thursday if there are no complications. Efforts to lift the 145-meter-long, 6,825-ton ship began at 10:00 a.m. with two salvage barges and the semisubmersible ship. It took several hours to decide whether to start lifting the ship because the sea must be fairly calm, meaning waves must be under 1 meter and wind speed needs to be below 10 meters per second. Earlier, the Seoul government decided to pull the ferry out of the water intact in order to protect any remains of the people still missing from the tragic sinking. The 85.1 billion won (US$72 million) project to recover the ship is being conducted by a Chinese consortium led by China's state-run Shanghai Salvage. Divers have worked on making the ship buoyant by injecting air into tanks in the vessel and installing large balloons and other flotation devices. Once the ship reaches Mokpo, authorities will try to find the remains of people still listed as missing and determine why the ship sank.

The US diplomat chief wrapped up his first Asian tour since taking office, which also took him to Japan and South Korea last week. US nuclear envoy Joseph Yun (L) meets with his South Korean counterpart Kim Hong-kyun in Seoul on March 22, 2017. (Yonhap)\"I had a chance to discuss (with China) the shape of our review on North Korea, which is ongoing, as well as the strong points that the secretary delivered both here and in Beijing on THAAD,\" Joseph Yun, the top US nuclear envoy, said at the start of talks with his South Korean counterpart Kim Hong-kyun. He came to Seoul from Beijing where he held talks with senior Chinese officials.\"The secretary conveyed it very strongly to the Chinese side and the secretary also said in private meetings that really retaliating against a defensive system which China has done was something that was uncalled for and something of a growing concern for us. So I believe those points were well delivered by the secretary,\" he added.China has been stepping up its economic retaliation against South Korea as it and the US went ahead with their plan to install a THAAD battery on the peninsula to better counter threats from the North. Beijing has objected to the plan, saying the powerful radar system will hurt its strategic security interests. In his press conference in Seoul on Friday, Tillerson called on China to refrain from retaliating against South Korea over THAAD, saying that it is \"inappropriate\" and \"troubling.\" He also stressed that the missile shield is for defensive purposes, not targeting anything other than missiles coming from the North.Tillerson, however, didn't seem to mention much about the THAAD issue during his stay in Beijing, raising speculation that he might not have delivered a clear warning against the ongoing economic retaliation zeroing in on South Korean businesses.Yun's trip to Seoul comes amid growing concerns over North Korea's additional provocations and mounting calls in Washington for stepped-up sanctions to starve Pyongyang of hard currency that could be exploited to advance its missile and nuclear programs.The North test-fired four ballistic missiles early this month and Pyongyang announced Sunday that it tested a new high-thrust rocket engine, raising speculation for provocations in the near future.In what appears to be the latest provocation, the North test-fired a missile from its east coast that appears to have failed, Seoul's defense ministry said earlier in the day.After completing his talks with Kim, Yun said that he heard about the latest missile test, saying it hurts ongoing global efforts to tackle the nuclear stalemate. \"It is not helpful at all. These are tests that have been banned by the UN Security Council resolutions, so it's not very helpful,\" he said.Asked if Washington considering a secondary boycott intended to penalize third-country firms doing business with the North in an effort to force Beijing to pressure Pyongyang, he said, \"Those are all things we need to study.\"Joseph Yun, the top US nuclear envoy (Yonhap)Meanwhile, during the talks with Kim, Yun emphasized the strong alliance and close communication between South Korea and the US, citing Tillerson's recent visit and the forthcoming trip to Seoul by Vice President Mike Pence.\"I think that shows the highest level of engagement that we have done. I want to thank you on your part also making sure that the alliance relationship and our approach to North Korea is very closely coordinated,\" he said. Kim noted that Tillerson made a \"very clear and strong statement\" in Seoul last week on the \"ironclad\" alliance with South Korea, the \"maximum level\" of sanctions against the North and China's \"inappropriate\" economic retaliation over THAAD.In a press release after the talks followed by a meeting over lunch, the foreign ministry said that the two condemned in unison the North's continued provocations, including the latest one on Wednesday, and agreed to step up the economic and diplomatic isolation of Pyongyang going forward.They also reconfirmed that it is not the right time to hold talks with the North given that it continues to carry out provocations, rather it is the time to apply more pressure on its regime until it changes its calculus. Yun delivered that position shared by Seoul and Washington during his trip to Beijing, the ministry said.A diplomatic source quoted Yun as saying during the talks in Seoul that he and his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei shared that it is premature to seek negotiations with the North. Yun added that Tillerson also made it clear in Beijing that Washington will not hesitate to punish any Chinese firms for illegal transactions with the North, according to the source.\u00a0(Yonhap)","984":"South Korea on Wednesday repatriated the remains of Chinese soldiers killed during the Korean War six decades ago, a move that reflects Seoul's commitment to the humanitarian project despite a political row between the neighboring countries over a US weapon system.The 28 sets of remains were handed over to China in a repatriation ceremony held at Incheon International Airport, just west of Seoul, according to the Ministry of National Defense.\u00a0 The repatriation ceremony for the remains of Chinese soldiers killed during the Korean War is under way at Incheon International Airport on March 22, 2017. (Yonhap)The remains belong to Chinese soldiers who died fighting against South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. China fought alongside North Korea, while the South was backed by UN forces including US troops.\"Historically, the repatriation of soldiers' remains between former war adversaries carries a peaceful message to heal the wounds of the past and develop their relations,\" Hwang In-moo, South Korea's vice defense minister, said in a speech at the event.Seoul and Beijing struck an agreement in 2014 on the return of Chinese soldiers' remains excavated from graves in South Korea on the basis of the humanitarian spirit specified in the Geneva Conventions.Hwang called it \"proof of trust\" between the two sides. China expressed its gratitude to the South Korean government and its people.\"(We) appreciate the friendship and good will that South Korean people and media have shown regarding the repatriation of Chinese soldiers' remains,\" said Sun Shaocheng, China's vice minister of civil affairs, leading his country's delegation.More than 180,000 Chinese soldiers are estimated to have died in the war.A total of 541 remains were sent back in three batches as of last year.There had been some doubts about the implementation of the deal, with the two sides at odds over the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea.China believes the US is seeking to position the advanced missile defense system on the peninsula not only to help ward off North Korea's threats but also to counter Beijing's growing military influence in the region.The allies, however, stress the need for the THAAD unit here is solely to cope with the North's possible missile attack more effectively.\"Although there is a difficulty in South Korea-China relations in the process of resolving the North Korean nuclear and missile issue, we pushed for the repatriation of the remains of Chinese soldiers this year from the humanitarian perspective,\" the ministry said in a separate statement.It vowed to continue the program and efforts to improve bilateral ties.Both Hwang and Sun did not mention the THAAD issue in their brief public remarks.

US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (center) (Yonhap)\"North Korea's nuclear arsenal poses a growing and urgent threat to the United States. Soon, many believe the Kim Jong-un regime will be able to target all 50 states and our Asian allies with a nuclear warhead,\" Royce said in a statement.\"The new administration already has tools at its disposal to help counter this threat,\" he said, referring to last year's North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act that the congressman authored. \"It is clear that additional authorities will better allow the US to crack down on the Kim regime.\"The new legislation, among other things, authorizes sanctions on those who \"knowingly, directly or indirectly, sold, transferred or otherwise provided significant amounts of crude oil, condensates, refined petroleum, or other types of petroleum or petroleum byproducts to the government of North Korea.\"It also prohibits \"any ships owned by the government of North Korea or owned or operated on behalf of any country not complying with UN Security Council resolutions from operating in United States waters or landing at any US port,\" according to a summary of the bill. The bill bans \"goods produced in whole or part by North Korean forced labor from entering the United States. It also sanctions foreign persons that employ North Koreans who are forced to labor in inhumane conditions and are denied access to wages and benefits.\"Exporting forced labor to foreign countries is estimated to earn the regime billions of dollars of hard currency each year and represents a significant human rights violation,\" the summary said. The legislation also calls for the US government to determine whether the North is a state sponsor of terrorism.

(For Use Only in the Republic of Korea. No Redistribution) (Yonhap)The North's last parliamentary meeting was held in June last year when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was elected as the chairman of the newly created State Affairs Commission.Every April, the SPA holds a plenary session, attended by hundreds of deputies, to finalize the country's budget spending and overhaul Cabinet organs. But the North's parliament held a smaller meeting led by its presidium in March last year ahead of the WPK's party congress held in May.The North's leader was elected the chairman of the WPK in the party congress, a move aimed at reaffirming his one-man leadership.The upcoming parliamentary session is timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of Kim Jong-un becoming the first secretary of the WPK, his previous title of the party chief.The current young leader has strengthened his power through a reign of terror since late 2011 when his father Kim Jong-il died of heart failure.It is rare for the country's assembly to make a decision on foreign policies at its key session, but in April 2012, it decided to state that North Korea is a nuclear state in the preface of the Constitution.At the party congress, the North's leader said that his country will \"permanently\" pursue his dual policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.\"Usually, the SPA decides on the country's budget spending in April,\" said an official at Seoul's unification ministry. \"But the North's leader may deliver a message, given that the upcoming event is its first assembly since US President Donald Trump took office.\"The United States is likely to unveil its new North Korea policy soon, which likely center on ramping up pressure on Pyongyang.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that all options, including military action, are on the table in dealing with North Korea's nuclear and missile threats.North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006 and claimed it has entered the final stage of preparing to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile which would target the US mainland.In April, North Korea is set to celebrate key anniversaries including the 105th birthday of late founder Kim Il-sung which falls on April 15. The Korean People's Army marks the 85th anniversary of its creation on April 25.\"This year, North Korea could put priority on increasing budget spending on the light industry or agriculture, rather than the military as it anticipates South Korea's political transition in May,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute.\"But I think that there is a high possibility that Pyongyang could conduct large-scale provocative acts including another nuke test or the launch of an ICBM ahead of the founder's birthday,\" he added.Lee Duk-haeng, spokesman at the Ministry of Unification, said that there is a need to watch North Korea's behavior around the session due to speculation about its possible nuclear and missile provocations.Analysts added that Pyongyang may conduct a reshuffle of members of the State Affairs Commission at the upcoming event to fill a vacancy following the dismissal of spy chief Kim Won-hong.Kim was sacked from the post of minister of state security in mid-January after a probe by the ruling party found his agency had abused authority. He was among eight members of the newly created organ SAC.The SAC replaced the National Defense Commission, which played a key role under the Kim Jong-il regime.\"As the Kim Jong-un regime appears to be relatively stable, the country would probably hold the assembly session in a celebrative mood (in the key year),\" said Kim Keun-sik, a professor at Kyungnam University.Other experts said that North Korea may unveil a set of economic measures that could include tax reforms or steps to spur operations of markets.At last year's party congress, the North's leader laid out a five-year strategy for economic growth, but his vision did not contain details such as specific targets.\u00a0(Yonhap)","987":"The South Korean government scraped a plan to put an ancient wall built in 1396 on the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Cultural Heritage Foundation said Tuesday.The decision came after the International Council on Monuments and Sites, an advisory group to UNESCO, ruled earlier this month \"not to inscribe\" the wall onto the World Heritage list.Parts of the Seoul City Wall (Yonhap)The Seoul City Wall is an 18.6-kilometer-long wall surrounding Hanyang, the former capital of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) and present-day central Seoul.The ICOMOS panels, whose advice is tantamount to a decision of the UN body, concluded the wall failed to fulfill Outstanding Universal Value and that it has relied too much on state supervision to be maintained, which hampers the continuation of tradition. \"As competition to get inscribed has been rising, evaluation is also getting very strict. We will do more thorough research and review when we apply for it in the future,\" the CHA said in a statement.The CHA and the Seoul metropolitan government plan to try to get it inscribed in 2020. (Yonhap)","988":"Results of the US review of options to deal with North Korea will come out \"sooner than later,\" a senior White House official said Tuesday.Christopher Ford, senior director for weapons of mass destruction and counterproliferation on the White House National Security Council, made the remark during a nuclear policy discussion, saying the North Korea problem \"clearly needs a new look.\"\"Past approaches to trying to contain that threat haven't worked as well as one would have liked them to work. So, you won't be surprised to learn that North Korea policy is, of course, subject to a broad review that does very explicitly look at the whole spectrum of possibilities,\" Ford said during the discussion organized by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\"Don't have answers on what will come out of that review but you may see something sooner rather than later on that,\" he said.\"The NSC's Asia Director was one of the first out of the box in policy review terms and starting to work on North Korea review through the interagencies.\"Ford also stressed the seriousness of the North Korean threat.\"It's got an unchecked nuclear weapons program, an accelerating missile-testing program that is increasingly poised to deliver a nuclear weapon over intercontinental ranges to the US It clearly presents a threat that we can't ignore,\" he said.The official reacted negatively to calls in South Korea for nuclear armament, saying the long-standing US objective has been to make sure \"those questions never need to arise on their own merits and to make sure that the circumstances that might drive that kind of consideration don't come about.\"Earlier, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the US in coordination with allies \"is exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures in response to the grave and escalating threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\"No details were given as to what those measures will look like, but the new package of options is expected to center on ramping up pressure on Pyongyang, rather than reopening negotiations. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during a trip to South Korea and Japan last week that two decades of diplomatic efforts to disarm the North have failed, and there was no point in pursuing the diplomatic path any longer. He also said that the US was considering a wide range of options, including the use of military force.In response, the North said it is fully ready for \"any war\" with the US.On Monday, US President Donald Trump called the North Korean situation \"disgraceful,\" arguing that he's inherited a lot of problems from the previous administration.\"The fact is we inherited a mess. It's a mess,\" Trump said in an address in Kentucky, picking the Middle East and North Korea as examples of such problems. \"North Korea, I'll tell you what, what's happening there is disgraceful and not smart, not smart at all. So many different problems.\"It was the latest in a series of remarks Trump has made about the North in recent days. On Friday, Trump tweeted, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" He also said on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acting \"very, very badly.\"That appears to show the problem weighs on Trump's mind. Former President Barack Obama reportedly warned Trump that North Korea will be one of Trump's biggest foreign policy problems when they met at the White House after Trump's election.

Former President Park Geun-hye leaves the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in the capital on March 22, 2017, after over 22 hours of a prosecution probe on corruption allegations that removed her from office earlier this month. (Yonhap)She is known to have denied all charges during the questioning, though prosecutors did not confirm her stance.Park's supporters were waiting for her from early in the morning, some stayed through the entire night, near the prosecution compound. Waiving national flags, they chanted, \"Nullify the Impeachment!\" as the car carrying her passed by.A group of other supporters also gathered near Park's private home. Park smiled and waved to them as she arrived home.Park was grilled over multiple allegations, including that local business groups donated huge sums of money to two foundations allegedly controlled by Park's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for business favors.Prosecutors summoned Choi and two of Park's jailed former aides -- An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong -- on Tuesday, but all three declined the call, citing personal reasons. Prosecutors refused to comment on whether the summons was for a cross-examination with the former president.Prosecutors will now mull over whether to seek an arrest of the ex-leader. They have so far avoided directly mentioning the possibility of seeking Park's detention.Park is the country's fourth former president to undergo questioning over criminal allegations, following Roh Tae-woo, Chun Doo-hwan and the late Roh Moo-hyun.\"I feel sorry to the public,\" Park said as she arrived at the prosecution. \"I will faithfully go through the interrogation.\" (Yonhap)","990":"South Korean political parties on Tuesday urged former President Park Geun-hye to own up to her wrongdoing and sincerely apologize to the people.\"Former President Park must apologize to the people and promise to reveal the truth,\" Rep.

Park Kwang-on said in a released statement. Park's former ruling party declined to comment on the former president's summons.\"We have no announcement to make regarding the party's position,\" the Liberty Korea Party said.However, party floor leader Chung Woo-taik later claimed all people must have felt sorry to see a former president summoned by the prosecution.\"Not only I but all people must have felt sorry to watch another former president and fourth in the country's history appear before the prosecution,\" he said while meeting with party officials.\"I sincerely wish such a tragedy will never be repeated,\" he added, urging the prosecution to show courtesy for the former president while questioning her.The conservative Bareun Party, on the other hand, urged a thorough, yet fair investigation by the prosecution.\"We wish the prosecution's questioning (of Park) will put an end to the national divide and turmoil,\" party spokesman Rep.

Obviously, both are strong allies and partners in the region,\" State Department acting spokesman Mark Toner said, adding that Tillerson has spoken several times with his South Korean counterpart just as he did with the Japanese foreign minister.\"I don't want to get into any argument over who's more important in this relationship. We consider both vitally important to the United States,\" Toner said.Another question that was raised about Tillerson's trip to Tokyo and Seoul was why he had dinner with his Japanese counterpart while in Tokyo but chose not to do so while in Seoul.Toner said that dinner was simply never scheduled.\"There was never any dinner scheduled. The secretary had very productive, long meetings with his Korean counterparts,\" he said. \"And then I think he ended up having a private dinner with his staff.\"\u00a0 (Yonhap)","992":"The White House expressed concern Monday about North Korea's weekend test of a high-powered rocket engine amid concern the communist nation could use the engine to carry out a threatened test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US.\"We continue to be concerned with North Korea's activity. That's why not only have we continued to have conversations with officials in Japan and South Korea, but continue to urge China to step in and play a larger role in deterring both the ballistic and other missile threats that North Korea plays,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in response to a question about President Donald Trump's reaction to the engine test.\"I think there is a growing concern about North Korea. I think that is part of what Secretary Tillerson is going to be discussing with him during their meeting,\" he said of a meeting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had with Trump after returning from a trip to Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing.Over the weekend, Trump also held a series of meetings to discuss North Korea, including one with his National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, according to the White House. It also said Trump also met with military personnel, though it was unclear if the meeting was related to North Korea.Trump said Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acting \"very, very badly.\"Saturday's engine test by the North came after Tillerson strongly signaled a hardline policy on the North, saying two decades of diplomatic efforts to disarm the North failed, and the US is looking at a range of options, including the use of military action.During a trip to Seoul and Tokyo, Tillerson also declared an end to former President Barack Obama's North Korea policy, known as \"strategic patience,\" which centers on waiting for Pyongyang to show good faith while increasing sanctions and pressure on the regime.\"I think he sent a very clear signal that our policy of strategic patience is over,\" Spicer said. He also called for China to play greater roles in reining in Pyongyang.\"The president and the secretary of state have an expectation that China employ multiple points of pressure on North Korea. We know that we don't agree 100 percent of the time with China, but as the State Department noted yesterday, both (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) and Secretary Tillerson agreed that there are opportunities for greater cooperation,\" he said.Spicer also said that an upcoming summit between Trump and Xi will be helpful in increasing cooperation.State Department acting spokesman Mark Toner said Tillerson's trip didn't produce a breakthrough, but was positive.\"I don't think we were looking for any major outcomes.

Of the North Korean rocket and missile projects that we are currently aware of, the best fit for this engine would be as the second stage of the new satellite launch vehicle provisionally known as the 'Unha-9,'\" Schilling said.Unha rockets are what the North has used to put satellite into orbit. The communist nation succeeded in such a satellite launch for the first time in late 2012 and again in February last year, demonstrating strides in its long-range missile technologies.The North has long said its rocket launches are part of its space program. But Pyongyang is banned from such launches under UN Security Council resolutions as it has been accused of using them as a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Schilling said there could be a \"yet-unknown ICBM design\" sized for the big engine, but such a possibility is not large because Pyongyang has been moving towards lighter mobile systems and solid propellants for their strategic missiles.\"They have been promising us an ambitious new space program, which will require a large new satellite launch vehicle. They have made extensive upgrades to the Sohae Satellite Launching Station to support such a vehicle,\" he said. \"Now they have shown us an engine that would be a good fit for this vehicle.\" (Yonhap)","994":"TOKYO, (AFP) -- Russia on Monday criticized the deployment of a US anti-missile system aimed at North Korea, saying it poses \"serious risks\" to the region.The US this month began installing the THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea in response to the North's intensifying ballistic missile development.Allies Washington and Seoul say it is for purely defensive purposes. China fears it could undermine its own nuclear deterrent and has lashed out, imposing measures seen as economic retaliation on South Korea.Russia, meanwhile, took advantage of diplomatic and defense talks with US ally Japan to criticize the development.\"We drew attention to the serious risks posed by the deployment of elements of the American global anti-missile system in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a press conference, saying Moscow raised the issue in the talks.\"If this is meant to counter threats coming from North Korea, then the deployment of this system and accumulating armaments in the region is a disproportionate reply,\" he added, apparently referring to THAAD.Russia last year also expressed worries over plans for the deployment in South Korea.Lavrov's comments came after so-called two-plus-two talks between the foreign and defence ministers of Russia and Japan.They also followed a high-profile visit to the region by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who warned that American military action against the North was an option \"on the table.\"North Korea did come in for criticism at the Russia-Japan meeting for its nuclear and missile development.\"We shared the view that we will strongly urge North Korea to exercise self-restraint over further provocative actions and follow UN Security Council resolutions,\" said Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.North Korea is banned by the international community from pursuing nuclear and missile programmes but has defiantly ploughed ahead.It staged its two latest nuclear tests last year and recently fired off missiles which it described as practice for an attack on US bases in Japan.Japan and Russia also tried to further bridge differences over a long-standing territorial dispute dating from World War II but achieved no major breakthroughs.The Soviet Union seized four islands off Japan's northern coast in 1945 in the closing days of the war and the dispute has prevented a peace treaty to formally end the conflict.The foreign and defence ministers' meeting, the first since late 2013, followed a December summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin that focused on the territorial row.Kishida announced that Abe will visit Russia in late April to continue their discussions on efforts to finally conclude a peace treaty ending the war.","995":"The second round of a legal battle over the ownership of an ancient Korean-made Buddhist statue which was stolen by South Korean thieves from a Japanese temple a few years ago will begin later this week, a high court official said Monday. In its ruling on Jan. 26, the Daejeon District Court ordered the government to hand over the 14th century statue to its original owner Buseok Temple. Earlier, the temple filed a suit against the government, claiming that the statue was first plundered by the Japanese from the temple, located in South Korea's southeastern city of Yeongju.\u00a0 The Gilt Bronze Seated Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Statue.

The Korean thieves stole the statue from Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island in Japan in October 2012, and smuggled it into the country that year. They were arrested a few months later. The South Korean authorities have retrieved the statue and preserved it at the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage in Daejeon, 164 kilometers south of Seoul thus far. After years of dispute, the lower court ruled in favor of the plaintiff.

Some health-conscious parents opt to have their kids skip school when the fine dust is so bad, with sales of air-quality control items such as air purifiers and other accessories like dust masks spiking every year as consumers scramble to spend money on anti-dust products. Experts have criticized the government's forecast on fine dust that usually tends to reassure citizens about taking part in outside activities, saying that even a \"normal level\" may not be safe for some people. \"(A bad level) should be OK for healthy people, but definitely not for asthmatic, diabetic patients or those with high blood pressure or a heart condition.

They include Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party, Chung Woo-taik of the former ruling Liberty Korea Party and Joo Ho-young of the minor conservative Bareun Party.Shortly after former President Park Geun-hye was removed in a March 10 ruling by the Constitutional Court, the whips of the four political parties agreed to hold weekly meetings to discuss and coordinate their policies as a way of helping stabilize the nation.The proposed special probe will reopen the so-called LCT scandal that was concluded by state prosecutors earlier this month.Wrapping up its seven-month investigation, the prosecution indicted 24 people on March 9 on suspicions of bribery and other irregularities surrounding the development project to build a skyscraper in the southern port city of Busan.Those indicted included Rep. Bae Duk-kwang of the Liberty Korea Party; Hyun Ki-hwan, a former presidential secretary under the Park administration; and former Busan Mayor Hur Nam-sik.The former ruling party criticized the prosecution's investigation as incomplete and even biased.\"The edge of the prosecution's sword was directed only at the incumbent administration and ruling party officials throughout the investigation, while opposition party figures did not face any serious questioning,\" Rep. Kim Myeong-yeon, a spokesman for the Liberty Korea Party, said earlier.The four floor leaders also discussed ways to reform the parliament procedures. They failed to narrow their differences and only agreed to implement reforms at the next National Assembly to be formed in 2020, they said.They will meet again next Monday.

It lasted a few minutes with the message being repeated twice. The last encrypted message sent by the North was detected on March 10 with this being the ninth of its kind this year.\u00a0(Yonhap)The announcer addressed the \"21st exploration team\" and said it is calling for a review of a math assignment. \"On page 924, number 49, on page 14, number 76, on page 418, number 37,\" the radio station broadcast, followed by more numbers. The latest batch of numbers are the same as those aired on March 5.It marked the 29th time that Pyongyang has broadcast encrypted numbers since June 2016.Broadcasts of mysterious numbers are seen as a kind of book cipher that was often used by North Korea to give missions to spies operating in South Korea during the Cold War era. Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence officials believe this form of sending orders to be outdated. Many have said the broadcast may be some sort of deception strategy aimed at sparking confusion within South Korea.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000, when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.

It is believed that Choe had played some role in (Kim Jong-un's) dismissal of the spy chief,\" the report said.Choe is one of the close aides to the North Korean leader. But, to maintain his monolithic regime, Kim Jong-un does not allow any officials to exert excessive influence.The report said that Choe has remained low-key since he was reinstated after being punished for his mishandling of a power plant project in late November 2015.\"To maintain his clout as a heavyweight, Choe needs a practical influence in appointment, but he is facing limitations, as Kim Jong-un has restricted his role (at the party) to prevent him from expanding his power base,\" the report added.In another sign of a power struggle, Choe is said to be at odds with Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of the Korean People's Army. Hwang is widely viewed as the No. 2 man in North Korea.Hwang reported to the North's leader about the possibility that Choe could lead a revolt when he served as the director of the KPA's general political bureau in the past, it said.\"Choe is known to be seeking revenge against Hwang on the belief that the report led to his dismissal,\" it added. Meanwhile, Hwang is seeking to prevent the dismissed spy chief and Kim Yong-chol, a key official handling inter-Korean affairs, from exerting an influence on the military.\"Among North Korean officials, there is a rumor that the relationship between Hwang and Kim Won-hong, the ex-state security minister, is like a dormant volcano whose timing for eruption is hard to predict,\" the report said.Gen. Kim Yong-chol was appointed as the party secretary handling inter-Korean affairs, doubling as the head of the United Front Department at the ruling party. He previously led North Korea's reconnaissance bureau.In the past, Kim Yong-chol had a good relationship with the spy chief, but his ties with Kim Won-hong and military official Hwang frayed as he sought to abuse his authority, the report added. (Yonhap)","1002":"POCHEON, Gyeonggi Province -- The exercise began with a bang from explosives being fired off near a ditch. Taking it as a cue for the North Korean Army\u2019s hypothetical invasion, South Korea\u2019s K-9 and K-55 self-propelled guns, as well as multiple rocket launchers, fired off dozens of volleys toward mock targets. The artillery attack was immediately followed by multiple sorties of F-15K and FA-50 jet fighters, which scrambled from the east and dropped bombs on dummy targets designed as North Korea\u2019s missile sites hidden in the mountain.Multiple rocket launchers fire off volleys of explosives during a counterfire exercise held at a training field in Pocheon in Gyeonggi Province on Wednesay. (Yonhap)That was a part of joint live-fire exercise by South Korean and US armed forces that took place from April 13 through Wednesday at a training field in Pocheon, some 30 kilometers south of the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas, which are technically still at war. It is a routine exercise that takes place almost every two years, but this year\u2019s was particularly significant because it coincided with North Korea\u2019s own massive artillery drill held Tuesday and Wednesday to mark the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People\u2019s Army. \u201cThis is simulating how things would be if we did go to combat with North Korea. This is what it would look like -- us and (the) ROK army working together,\u201d 1st Lt. Steve Porter, who served at the 366 armor regimen within the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, told The Korea Herald.Starting with North Korea\u2019s invasion, the exercise scenario includes a \u201ccounterfire drill\u201d that aims to target hundreds of North Korea\u2019s long-range artillery unit lined up on the DMZ. Their projectile is said to reach up to Seoul\u2019s metropolitan area, home to around 25 million South Korean people -- half of the country\u2019s population. Wednesday\u2019s exercise was observed from a distance by acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, leading presidential candidate Moon Jae-in, dozens of high-profile defense officials and army generals, and thousands of local residents.Employing about 2,000 troops and 250 equipment from South Korea\u2019s Army, Air Force and the US Army, the combined exercise showcased the allies\u2019 capability to fend off North Korea in the event of an all-out war. \u201cI think today\u2019s exercise can give reassurance to the people that our military has capability to neutralize North Korea\u2019s military provocation,\u201d Moon told reporters after the drill. \u201cI think there are no politics when it comes to national security.\u201d Besides the self-propelled guns and jet fighters, the drill involved armored vehicles and tanks, such as South Korea\u2019s K2 Black Panther and K12A tanks, as well as the US M1A2 Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and a multiple rocket launcher system. Among those being showcased, the most popular were arguably the AH-64E Apache helicopters, which South Korea completed deployment in January. Currently, South Korea has established two Apache battalions and underwent the fielding process, such as training pilot and outfitting the weapons. \u201cIt\u2019s like riding a first-class sedan. It feels so comfortable,\u201d said a South Korean Apache pilot, who declined to reveal his identity due to the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cI think it\u2019s much more advanced than any other helicopters I have flown.\u201d The drill has taken place a total of eight times since 1977. This year\u2019s exercise was expected to take place in August, as the previous one had two years ago, but the schedule was moved up amid heightened tension on the peninsula over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threat. Although North Korea has yet to conduct its sixth nuclear test, Pyongyang staged a massive artillery drill Wednesday near Wonsan along the country\u2019s eastern coast. According to the state-run Central News Agency, Pyongyang\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the drill. \u201cToday\u2019s exercise gives an opportunity to enhance combined and joint operation capability,\u201d said Army Lt. Col Chung Seong-ho, who served as commander of South Korea\u2019s Army artillery battalion. \u201cBased on the robust Korea-US alliance, we will defend our country.\u201dBy Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","1003":"Talks between the top diplomats of the United States and China on Saturday underscored a marked difference in their approaches toward North Korea, despite their shared concerns and promise of cooperation regarding its ever-growing threats.\u00a0 US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his visit to Beijing, the last leg of his three-nation trip to Asia following stops in Japan and South Korea.Their talks focused on the upcoming summit between their leaders and the North\u2019s escalating nuclear and missile threats.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Foreign Minister Wang Yi (AFP-Yonhap)In a joint press conference after the meeting, Tillerson said that the North\u2019s threats have reached a \"dangerous level\" and that the two sides agreed to cooperate to make the North choose a better path. He promised to work together with China on resolving the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions.But a stark difference in their future approaches was apparent when Wang reiterated the importance of diplomacy in breaking the nuclear stalemate. Tillerson\u2019s seemingly moderate and cooperative tone came only after he had unleashed a barrage of hawkish remarks against North Korea during his stops in Tokyo and Seoul.In a press conference in Seoul, Tillerson declared the end of former US President Barack Obama\u2019s \"strategic patience\" policy and signaled a sharp turn toward a tougher policy involving ramped-up sanctions, pressure and even military actions. \"The policy of strategic patience has ended,\" he said. \"We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures. All options are on the table.\"Tillerson said that military measures could be one option if the threat from the North gets too high. He also ruled out the possibility of any immediate negotiations. He noted that conditions are \"not ripe\" for any talks with the North, while calling on China to do more to induce a meaningful change in its behavior.In Tokyo, he emphasized the need for a \"new approach\" after the failure of the past two decades of talks and aid to the North on hopes that it will take the path to denuclearization.He didn\u2019t provide details but provided a glimpse into what appears to be the Trump administration\u2019s new policy toward the recalcitrant North, experts said.Wang, meanwhile, hinted that China doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with the US on how to deal with the North. He said that diplomacy should be pursued and called for the resumption of the long-suspended six-party denuclearization talks.Last week, Wang said sanctions are just one option but no less important is to encourage talks. He said China will play its part in bringing the nuclear stalemate back to the \"negotiation\" track.The close ally to the North played host to the six-party negotiations involving South and North Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia until they came to a stop in late 2008. China\u2019s repeated emphasis on diplomacy and negotiations are in contrast with the US\u2019s approach which rules out any talks until the North takes a meaningful step toward denuclearization.Experts expect the differing approaches between the two superpowers to continue for the time being despite their pronounced common awareness of the North\u2019s military threats.\"It seems to be hard to find common ground between the US and China. The Trump administration is getting tougher on the North, while China mentions the resumption of the six-party talks. This signals parallel approaches between the two for the time being,\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University.\"From China\u2019s standpoint, once it gives into the so-called new approach proposed by the US, it could end up hurting its ties with the North. It might be hard for Beijing to strongly rebuff the strong US push, but chances are high that it will still stay put on its own stance for some time,\" he added.Tillerson\u2019s first trip to Asia as secretary of state comes amid concerns that North Korea might be preparing additional provocations including a possible nuclear test.Pyongyang conducted two nuclear tests last year alone and continued to ignore multiple international resolutions and sanctions, most recently launching four ballistic missiles on March 6.\u00a0 Tillerson\u2019s tour is apparently intended to share views with the Northeast Asian stakeholders before the Trump administration comes up with its new North Korea approach, which is said to be in its final stages of review.Top US nuclear envoy Joseph Yun is currently in Beijing and he will visit South Korea next week to discuss a coordinated approach to the North, indicating that the review of Washington\u2019s policy on the North is nearing an end.

OECD data showed a South Korean on average worked 2,124 hours in 2014, 1.2 times more than the average.Less than half (49.9 percent) of South Korean women were employed as of 2015 compared to the OECD average of 57.9 percent.South Korea's fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime, is also the lowest among OECD member states together with Portugal at 1.24 in 2015.The latest poll showed that only 56.6 percent of working moms continued working one year after they concluded childcare leave as of 2014. People can take up to a year off to look after their children, which women often take immediately following the completion of three-month maternity leave.The comparable figures were 47.4 percent in 2010, 48.5 percent in 2011, 51.3 percent in 2012 and 54.1 percent in 2013.The figures were over 60 percent for five consecutive years from 2002.The findings showed that working moms who only took the three months of maternity leave stayed longer at their workplaces. Some 80 percent were still working at their previous jobs a year after returning to work in 2014.About 63.8 percent of working moms used maternity leave and childcare leave in 2014 with the figures declining to 62.6 percent in 2015 and 60.5 percent in 2016. The comparable figure was 18.7 percent in 2003 which rose to 60 percent in 2012.The report proposed the government come up with measures to foster a \"gender equal, family-friendly and performance-based labor market\" to raise the birthrate and employment for women.

The heads of Yonsei University and Korea University answer questions from reporters at a joint press conference at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul on April 26, 2017. (Yonhap)\"The two schools share the idea that student athletes should first obtain academic abilities based on amateurism,\" they said in a statement. The philosophy of amateurism for student athletes emphasizes the importance of education as the first priority, not sports. Those students will be subject to strict academic management and will not be allowed to participate in competitions unless they show a certain level of academic achievements, the presidents said.The management of student athletes came into the spotlight after it was revealed that Chung Yoo-ra, daughter of ousted President Park Geun-hye's friend and a former member of the national equestrian team, received undue favors in admissions and academic affairs at Seoul-based Ewha Womans University using the admission program for student atheletes.Chung's mother Choi Soon-sil is standing trial over a string of allegations in connection with a corruption scandal that removed Park from office and eventually led to her arrest last month.Still, the two presidents said the latest announcement was not related to the scandal. \"We discussed adopting amateurism for student athletes last spring,\" Yeom said. \"We had our statement ready by November but could not find the right time to release it following the outbreak of the scandal.\" (Yonhap)","1008":"The government should increase financial support for patients with cancer, the leading cause of death in South Korea, to help reduce the burden of their medical expenses, a local nonprofit health organization said Friday.The Korea Cancer Care Alliance released a set of policy suggestions that center around the government giving support to patients and their families so as to ease excessive financial burdens associated with medical care.A total of 76,855 people died of cancer in 2015, which accounted for 27.9 percent of all deaths reported in the country, according to the data provided by Statistics Korea. Cancer's death rate -- the number of deaths per 100,000 people -- stood at 150.8 in 2015, down slightly from the previous year's 150.9.\"The government should review a policy that assists new medicine development by strengthening support for clinical trials,\" said Yim Young-hyeok, chief of the alliance, adding that cancer patients should not lose an opportunity for treatment due to financial reasons. Under the advisory, the government should come up with a system to bolster clinical trials and to drastically reduce burdens for patients with stage four cancer, the alliance said.Also, a discussion panel made up of representatives from the government, the National Assembly, doctors, patients and pharmaceutical companies should be set up to tackle cancer in a systematic manner, the group said. (Yonhap)","1009":"Six-party nuclear talks with North Korea failed to deliver their intended results, the State Department said Thursday, adding to Secretary Rex Tillerson's point that diplomatic efforts to disarm Pyongyang failed and a new approach is necessary.\"There's a recognition that certain mechanisms, like the six-party talks, haven't really borne the fruit that we would have liked to have seen them bear over the years,\" State Department acting spokesman Mark Toner said at a regular briefing.\"That's no surprise to anyone, it hasn't fulfilled its potential,\" he said.The Chinese-hosted six-party talks, which also involved the two Koreas, Japan, Russia and the United States, were launched in 2003 to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear programs in exchange for concessions. The negotiating process produced some agreements, but all of them later fell apart as the North backtracked on its promises.The talks were last held in late 2008.Earlier Thursday, Tillerson said in Tokyo after talks with his Japanese counterpart that 20 years of diplomatic efforts to end the North's nuclear program have failed, even though the US provided the North with $1.35 billion in assistance, and it's time to come up with a new approach.Toner said the assistance was provided in food and energy aid between 1995 and 2008.\"All of these past efforts were undertaken with an eye towards finding ways to bring North Korea back into a discussion about its nuclear program and to address concerns about its nuclear program.But I think given the recent state of missile tests and nuclear tests, that we need to look anew on how we do what we're already doing more effectively with respect to sanctions,\" Toner said.\"This is a time of real concern. The threat frankly has increased and it's a threat, not just to our allies and partners in the region, but to US national security interests. So with that in mind, we're looking at whatever options we have,\" he said.Still, Toner said that the US wants to resolve the standoff \"in a way that allows for the peaceful and diplomatic resolution of our concerns\" and the US is ready for talks if the North is ready to hold serious denuclearization talks.

He was referring to the killing of the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which took place at an airport in Kuala Lumpur with banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent.Seoul said that North Korea is behind the death of Kim Jong-nam, but the North claimed that Malaysia colluded with South Korea to manipulate its probe into the case.

The three, including Kim Chang-geun, former chairman of SK\u2019s top decision-making body SUPEX Council, showed up at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office in southern Seoul at 10 a.m. to be questioned over allegations that the group bribed Park and her jailed friend Choi Soon-sil in exchange for business favors. Lee Hyung-hee, chief of SK Group's TV service unit SK Broadband, arrives at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul to undergo questioning on March 16, 2017.

SK denies the bribery. Asked by reporters on his way to the prosecutors\u2019 office, Kim also denied the allegations. The summoning of SK executives comes just a day after the prosecution sent out a summons to former President Park, who was sacked last week by the Constitutional Court over a sweeping corruption scandal involving Choi, her friend of 40 years. Investigations so far, including one led by an independent counsel, had focused on Park-Choi ties and their alleged shady dealings with Samsung Group using the aforementioned foundations. Samsung Group de facto leader Lee Jae-young is currently under arrest, pending a criminal trial for bribery. Prosecutors plan to expand their probe into other conglomerates, including the Lotte and CJ groups, which also gave donations to Choi\u2019s foundations, a prosecution official told reporters. \u201cWe will take due action on them when necessary,\u201d he said. As for SK Group chief Chey, the official did not rule out the possibility of summoning him for questioning. \u201cWe will look into that later,\u201d he said. SK Group\u2019s business spans from telecommunication to oil refinery, with the flagship units SK Hynix, the world\u2019s second-largest memory chip maker, and SK Telecom, the country\u2019s No. 1 telecom firm. Prosecutors also suspect that aside from Chey\u2019s pardons, the donations were in relation to the group\u2019s winning of a duty-free license. Independent counsel Park Young-soo, upon concluding his 70-day investigation, booked then-President Park as an accomplice to Choi in the bribery. He said Park \u201cshared economic interests\u201d with Choi and they ran the foundations together. The state prosecution is to question Park in person Tuesday. A total of 53 companies, including Samsung and SK, gave a total of 77.4 billion won ($66.9 million) in donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations.

The initial construction work is underway. (Yonhap)\"As North Korea rapidly improves its nuclear and missile capabilities, Seoul and Washington have stepped up efforts to complete the THAAD installation as quickly as possible,\" he said.On Feb. 28, the defense ministry and Lotte Group signed a land swap deal, paving the way for an earlier-than-expected deployment of a THAAD battery in South Korea. In November, the US Forces Korea expected to finish the deployment between June and August.Lotte agreed to hand over its golf course worth 89 billion won ($79 million) in Seongju in exchange for state-owned military property east of Seoul. The process to deploy the THAAD system began last week. Two missile launchers and other equipment arrived at US Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, 70 km south of Seoul. \"The radar system for THAAD and other remaining elements will be delivered to South Korea soon or later (within this month) and undergo an operational test before deployment,\" the official said, dismissing reports that the radar system will arrive on Thursday. The deployment could be completed within one or two months, and it can be operational as early as April, military officials said.The personnel needed to deploy the THAAD elements in Seongju and carry out a test run are expected to come from THAAD units in Guam and Fort Bliss, Texas.\u00a0 A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors (eight per launcher), a fire control and communications unit, and an AN\/TPY-2 radar. THAAD is designed to intercept short and mid-range missiles, such as Scud and Rodong, which have a range of up to 3,000 kilometers at altitudes of 40-150 kilometers. Seoul and Washington have said the system is purely defensive and poses no threat to other countries in the region. But China has opposed it, arguing the system's powerful radars could spy on its flights and missile launches. In July last year, Pyongyang's continued provocations apparently provided a strong impetus for the allies to agree to deploy the THAAD system in South Korea by the end of 2017.

An image of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)All evidence showed that the North was behind the assassination, including the use of the nerve agent VX, a banned chemical weapon. Eight North Koreans were named as suspects in the case, though Pyongyang has denied any involvement.Joseph DeThomas, a former senior State Department diplomat who served as ambassador to Estonia, said in an article carried by 38 North, a website specializing on North Korea analysis, that the US should take stock of the situation before taking action.\"Re-designation offers only limited gains,\" DeThomas said, adding that the sanctions supposed to come with the designation would add little to the already heavy set of sanctions imposed on Pyongyang for its nuclear and missile programs.

The Southeast Asian nation, which had taken a relatively restrained approach to inspecting suspect North Korean cargo, is likely to be much more willing to crack down, he said.\"Strategically, there should be no rush to designate Pyongyang. In the larger regional context, the North Korean issue does not need any additional ignition points.

The prosecution\u2019s move comes four days after the Constitutional Court unanimously voted to unseat Park over a scandal involving bribery, influence peddling and systematic leaks of government secrets. The decision stripped her of presidential immunity to criminal prosecution. Upon returning to her private residence in southern Seoul on Sunday, Park said through a spokesman that the truth would be revealed someday, which was largely taken as a continuation of her earlier stance to deny any wrongdoings and a hint at a legal fight against the charges raised against her.

Chun refused summons by the prosecution and stayed at his hometown, which led the prosecution to detain him and investigate him behind bars. Roh and Chun later respectively received a 17-year prison term and life sentence on charges of mutiny and treason for their roles in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju Uprising.

(Yonhap)","1038":"The United States should consider \"aggressive movement\" toward North Korea, including issuing a warning that it will shoot down any missile the communist nation test-fires, a former senior defense official said Monday.Mary Beth Long, who served as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs from 2007-2009, made the case during a Council on Foreign Relations discussion, saying diplomatic approaches have failed to resolve the situation.\"I think everyone can conclude there's been no demonstrative improvements whatsoever by approaching this from a diplomatic perspective. The one consistency in the last 40-plus years has been that we have never taken any kind of defense or aggressive movement toward North Korean testing. I think it's time to do so,\" she said.Considered one of the leading candidates for undersecretary of defense for policy, Long said that the ongoing deployment of the US THAAD missile defense system is one of the examples of such military measures.\"It is signaling to the North Koreans, the South Koreans, the Chinese and others that we will be able to take active measures, but I think we need to have a dialogue with the Chinese to make sure that they understand that that is going to go into place and operational and that its intent is to intercept only the North Koreans,\" she said.The US should also explain to Beijing that THAAD would not have been necessary if China had been serious about stemming North Korean threats, Long said, adding that China is \"as responsible for the THAAD having to be taken into place as anyone else is\" because it failed to rein in the North.\"I think we need to re-examine whether we declare that we will intercept while it is on the pad or in flight, any further missile that is launched by North Korea, particularly any of those with the range or the payload beyond the Scud that we've all been living with and I believe at an increased tempo,\" Long said.She noted that there were a grand total of about 21 ballistic missile tests by the North that were in violation of UN resolutions last year, and this year alone there have already been five launches that have demonstrated an increasing tempo and an increasing range.Long also suggested a \"collective security declaration\" providing assurances to South Korea and to Japan.\"Having this declared declaration will also give a framework within which we can talk to both the Chinese and the North Koreans as far as what we're going to do militarily and diplomatically,\" she said. (Yonhap)","1039":"North Korea on Tuesday condemned South Korea and the United States for staging joint military exercises, warning that Washington's strategic assets are within the range of the North Korean military's striking means.North Korea is ready to launch \"merciless ultra-precision strikes\" from the ground, air, sea and underwater, if Seoul and Washington attempt to infringe upon the North's sovereignty, according to the Korean Central News Agency.South Korea and the US should be \"mindful that nuclear-powered carriers and all other strategic assets of the US imperialists are in sight of the Korean People's Army's powerful ultra-precision strike means,\" the report said.Seoul and Washington kicked off their annual joint drills -- Key Resolve and Foal Eagle -- in March. The two-week war game Key Resolve started Monday, while the two-month combat training Foal Eagle runs through the end of April.North Korea has long denounced the exercises as war rehearsals for a northern invasion despite South Korea and Washington's assurance that they are defensive in nature.This year's drills brought in Washington's strategic assets, including the nuclear-powered USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and F-35B stealth fighter.The KCNA said that the mobilization of US strategic assets points to Seoul and Washington's move to stage full-scale nuclear war games targeting North Korea.\"This vividly shows that the US imperialists' reckless scheme for a pre-emptive strike at the DPRK is going into practice in actuality,\" the report said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.North Korea's condemnation against the joint military drills is not unusual as it usually ratchets up its belligerent rhetoric against Seoul and Washington during the exercises.Experts said the North may stage a nuclear or missile provocation around key anniversaries in April, including the 105th birthday of the country's late founder Kim Il-sung, which falls on April 15. (Yonhap)","1040":"The US plan to deploy a military drone in South Korea is part of efforts to bolster defenses for the Asian ally and American interests against North Korean threats in addition to the THAAD missile defense system, the State Department said Monday.State Department acting spokesman Mark Toner made the remark, confirming Yonhap News Agency's report that the US Army plans to permanently station a Gray Eagle unmanned aerial system company at Gunsan Air Base in South Korea to enhance its strike capabilities against ground targets in North Korea.\u00a0MQ-1C Gray Eagle (Yonhap)\"This is, I think, an ongoing effort to defend the Republic of Korea and US interests in order to maintain regional security, stability and economic prosperity for the region. In addition to THAAD ... these are defensive measures that are a response to what we ... view as a real and credible threat to our security,\" Toner said.\"These are very clearly defensive measures that we're taking in response to an increasingly worrying, concerning threat from North Korea. China understands that threat. They're not oblivious to what's happening in North Korea with, again, the pace of the testing that's been going on over the past six months,\" he said.China has railed against the deployment of a THAAD battery, claiming the system, especially its powerful radar, could be used to spy on the country and undermine its nuclear deterrent, despite repeated assurances from Washington that the battery is designed only to defend against North Korean threats.The issue will be a topic for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's upcoming trip to Beijing, Toner said.\"I think part of, obviously, the discussions he's going to have when he's in Beijing are hopefully going to be geared toward easing some of those concerns but also in making very clear that we're taking these actions in an effort to deal with an increasing threat and that we have to do more, we have to look at new ideas, new ways of dealing with North Korea,\" he said.\"So we understand there's -- everybody agrees on the challenge, which is: How do you stop North Korea's bad behavior? There's many ways to look at the problem, many ways to address it. I think part of this trip will be about trying to hone in on some next steps.\" (Yonhap)","1041":"The United States believes the ongoing deployment of the THAAD missile defense system has nothing to do with the political situation in South Korea because it's a \"very utterly reasonable step\" against North Korean threats, a senior State Department official said Monday.Acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton made the remark during a Foreign Press Center briefing previewing Secretary of State Rex Tilleron's upcoming trip to Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing as South Korea prepares to elect a new leader after former President Park Geun-hye was ousted from office for corruption.\"I think we're certainly aware that there's going to be an upcoming political process and a set of new elections for president coming up and that there may be candidates that will be different from those that have been in the administration in recent years,\" Thornton said.She said it's difficult to say what the situation means for THAAD because it's not clear even who the candidates are.\"But the way we look at the THAAD deployment is it's a very utterly reasonable step for a country to take, which sees itself threatened by missiles from its northern neighbor, and not only sees itself threatened, but these threats and these provocations are coming now with great regularity and it's very alarming to people who have to live under that kind of situation,\" Thornton said.\"So I think for us, the THAAD deployment is not related to some political constellation or other consideration,\" she said. \"It's a very reasonable and real response to a very provocative threat that is facing people in South Korea.\"Asked if the US would accept a reversal in South Korea's decision to host THAAD, Thornton said that the deployment was an alliance decision made jointly between the US and the South. Park's ouster came just days after the US brought into South Korea the first elements of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery that the two countries agreed to host in the country to defend better against North Korean missile threats.Her exit could raise doubts about her decision to host THAAD amid intensifying pressure from China, which has strongly railed against the deployment, claiming the system, especially its powerful radar, can be used against the country. Thornton also said that Park's impeachment and ultimate removal from office took place through \"a pretty transparent process undergirded by varying democratic institutions which have really proven their mettle in the unfolding of this peaceful process.\"She said that how to deal with North Korea will be an important topic in Tillerson's trip.\"This trip will allow Secretary Tillerson to engage allies and partners on not only a range of bilateral issues, also importantly to discuss and coordinate strategy to address the advancing nuclear missile threat from North Korea,\" Thornton said.\"The United States is committed to holding North Korean accountable for its flagrant and repeated disregard of UN Security Council resolutions which explicitly prohibit ballistic missile and nuclear programs. We will defend our friends and allies, of course, the Republic of Korea and Japan and seek to work collaboratively to the maximum extent possible with important partners like China on this issue,\" she said.Tillerson is scheduled to leave Tuesday for the trip that will take him to Tokyo on Wednesday, Seoul on Friday and Beijing on Saturday. While in Seoul, Tillerson is scheduled to meet with Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.The trip comes as the administration of President Donald Trump is putting together its North Korea policy.\"The current administration, especially following on the missile launches that occurred a couple of weeks ago, is looking very actively at the issue of North Korea and reviewing its approach and what kinds of options it's considering. That process is still ongoing,\" Thornton said.She said the US is \"intent on keeping up the pressure on the North Korean regime and trying to change the calculus on the part of the North Korean leadership to come back to the negotiating table and discuss its illegal and very destabilizing weapons programs.\"\"Certainly discussing the elements of any new approach will be an important part of discussions,\" she said. (Yonhap)","1042":"US President Donald Trump offered some backhanded praise for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, calling him \"a pretty smart cookie\" in a television interview that aired Sunday.Trump's almost admiring remarks came amid soaring tensions with North Korea over its missile and nuclear programs, with an alarmed Washington looking to China for help in reining in Kim.Trump said he had \"no idea\" whether Kim was sane or not, but said the North Korean leader had faced a formidable challenge in taking over the country at a reported age of 27 after his father's death in 2011.\"He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others. And at a very young age, he was able to assume power,\" Trump said in the interview with CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\"A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it.\"So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie,\" he said.(Yonhap)\"But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue,\" Trump added.North Korea has kept the West on edge for weeks over signs it may conduct a sixth nuclear test, punctuated by a series of missile tests that have aroused US fears that the regime may be close to developing a ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland with a nuclear warhead.\u00a0'A chess game' The North, defying mounting US pressure, launched its latest missile test on Saturday, which South Korea said failed.Trump refused comment on whether the United States had anything to do with the missile test failure.\"It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is. So eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.\"Hours before the North Korean test, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned of \"catastrophic consequences\" if the international community does not act more forcefully to sanction Pyongyang.The United States has deployed a naval strike group to the area led by the carrier USS Carl Vinson, which on Saturday began drilling with the South Korean navy to practice procedures for tracking and intercepting enemy ballistic missiles.On Sunday, the two allies concluded a massive annual military exercise called \"Foal Eagle,\" which involved around 20,000 South Korean and 10,000 US troops.Betting on ChinaIf North Korea carries out a nuclear test, Trump told CBS, \"I would not be happy.\"\"And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either,\" Trump said.Asked if \"not happy\" signified \"military action,\" Trump answered: \"I don't know. I mean, we'll see.\"So far, Trump has placed his biggest bet on getting China to use its leverage to pressure Pyongyang to change its behavior, a strategy that has failed to produce results in the past.Since meeting with China's President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida April 6-7, Trump has set aside his campaign threats to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and declare Beijing a currency manipulator.\"I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade,\" he told CBS.\"Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem -- that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States,\" he said.

There could arise complex situations in terms of administrative affairs on the South Korean government side,\" Pellerin said of potential impact of the impeachment of Park Geun-hye on the Pyeongchang Olympics. \"But I think it will be successfully hosted as many people are working enthusiastically. South Korean people are hoping for the smooth hosting,\" she said in a press conference at the French Embassy in Seoul. \"Two years ago, Brazil was in the same situation, but hosted its Olympics successfully. Part of my mission is to contribute to the successfully holding of the PyeongChang Olympics,\" she said. In January, Pellerin was named as \"Grand Temoin\" for the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, an international association of 57 French-speaking countries, to oversee the use of the French language and represent the association during the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games.\u00a0 A major part of her duties as Grand Temoin includes providing support for the translation of PyeongChang Olympics booklets and guidebooks into French as well as hosting cultural events to promote the francophonic society during the Olympics.It is the first time the OIF would sent its Grand Temoin to an Olympics event in South Korea since the organization was established in 2004. \"What is notable is that the Korean experience will become lessons for future Olympics planned in Japan and China ...

Back in France, there has been a sharp increase in French people wanting to study the Korean language thanks to the popularity of Korean pop music and drama, she stressed. \"Last year the number of people studying Korean exceeded the number of those studying Japanese in France,\" she said.The Korean language has also recently been included as one of the foreign language tests for baccalaureat, the French college entrance exam, she said. \"It is really a big change,\" she noted.

Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn will decide on their fate.\u00a0Presidential Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok (L) and senior political affairs secretary Hur Won-je (Yonhap)There are 10 vice-ministerial senior secretary posts within Cheong Wa Dae. Former policy coordination secretary An Chong-bum has already been arrested for his alleged roles in the Choi Soon-sil scandal. The move was seen as a sign for the officials to take responsibility for their failure to assist their boss in the run up to the scandal. Park returned to her private residence in southern Seoul late Sunday following the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling in favor of her impeachment Friday. With a deepening leadership vacuum and social strife, Hwang will take \u201ccareful consideration\u201d over their resignations, officials at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said. While Han and Hur are likely to see their terms end given the nature of their duties, the secretaries on foreign policy and security as well as the economy may be allowed to stay to help deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats, China\u2019s economic retaliation over the THAAD missile shield program and other pressing challenges at hand. Hwang would also take into account the need for handover preparations, as under the law the next government will be inaugurated in less than two months without a regular transition committee. The premier is expected to announce this week the presidential election date, which will likely fall on May 9. With the March 10 verdict, the government is required to set the date within 10 days, and the Interior Ministry is currently carrying out related work together with the National Election Commission. In light of the urgency, Hwang is considering unveiling the date by convening an extra Cabinet meeting instead of the regular Tuesday session, PMO officials said. Speculation persists the acting president might run for the top job himself as the flag-bearer of the Liberty Korea Party. He has been meeting with elder and incumbent politicians, in part due to his current duty, and witnessed a steady increase to 10 percent in public support according to polls, although the figures dropped slightly in the wake of Park\u2019s impeachment. But the mainstream view is leaning against his run, which could backfire given his pressing tasks of stable management of state affairs and the upcoming election. To vie for the presidency, Hwang also must step down a month before polls open. Meanwhile, controversy is growing over whether Hwang is entitled to designate confidential presidential records in the aftermath of Park\u2019s impeachment. The Presidential Archives within the National Archives of Korea said Monday it has begun preparations for the documents\u2019 transfer, saying the acting president has the right to pick what to move. Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk also told reporters later in the day the office is working on the files\u2019 classification for a report to Hwang. But opposition lawmakers argue the acting president should refrain from exercising the authority, warning against any attempt to block the prosecution\u2019s access to what could be vital evidence for its ongoing probe into the scandal. Hwang has already taken flak for denying an independent counsel\u2019s request for a raid on Cheong Wa Dae and for an extension of its investigation period. Rep. Kang Byung-won of the main opposition Democratic Party has proposed a bill governing the handling of presidential records in the impeachment-driven absence of the commander-in-chief.

Satellite imagery of the North's nuclear test site in the northeast area shows that a tunnel under continued excavation has displayed potential for North Korea to carry out an additional nuke test of significantly higher explosive yields, according to 38 North, a US website monitoring the North.The ministry said that it sees North Korea being able to conduct a nuclear test at any time if its leadership makes the order to do so.\"The government believes that Pyongyang can carry out a nuclear provocation at any time as its nuke test is carried out in accordance with the country's plan on nuclear weapons development,\" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, said at a regular press briefing.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year alone following those in 2006, 2009 and 2013.Pyongyang is seeking to conduct another nuclear test around South Korea's presidential election this year, Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to Seoul last year, told lawmakers in December.Experts said that the North may stage a missile or nuclear provocation in April when the country marks key anniversaries.The North will celebrate the 105th birthday of the country's late founder Kim Il-sung, which falls on April 15. The Korean People's Army marks the 85th anniversary of its creation on April 25.Meanwhile, the ministry rejected North Korea's repeated claim that it does not need to possess nuclear weapons if Seoul and Washington stop their annual military drills.South Korea and the United States kicked off their military exercises on March 1 amid heightened tensions following the North's launch of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile in February.North Korea has denounced the drills as war rehearsals for a northern invasion despite Seoul and Washington's assurance that they are defensive in nature.Jeong said that the North's claim that it would abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the end of the military drills has been proven wrong.

In the next 30 days, there is a 62 percent chance for North Korean WMD activity. Beyond Parallel defines WMD activity as nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches,\" it said.The North's March 6 missile launches represent the second major provocative act by Pyongyang since US President Donald Trump took office. In its first provocation under Trump, the North test-fired a newly developed intermediate-range ballistic missile on Feb. 12.The latest launches were seen as a show of force by Pyongyang in response to the ongoing annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States that the North has long denounced as a rehearsal for an invasion of the country.Concerns have persisted that Pyongyang could carry out more missile launches, including a test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the continental US that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to conduct.Commercial satellite imagery has also shown continued activity at the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site, a possible indication that Pyongyang may be preparing to conduct its sixth nuclear test after two nuclear tests last year.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters, a day after he and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) had dinner with Trump at the White House, according to AP.(Yonhap)Graham also posted a Twitter message saying, \"Pres @realDonaldTrump is NOT going to let the nutjob in North Korea develop a missile -- with a nuclear weapon on top -- that can hit the US.\"In an interview with Fox News, Graham also said that Trump \"doesn't want a war any more than I do, but he's not going to let them get a missile. That's where they're headed. And China needs to up their game to stop this before it gets too late.\"The senator said he prefers to solve the problem through diplomacy and sees military force as a \"last resort.\"McCain also told reporters that the Trump administration's hardline rhetoric against the North is \"legitimate.\"\"Obviously you have to follow words with action, but I think their expressed concern is very legitimate. And I don't think it's inflammatory rhetoric,\" the senator told reporters. McCain also said the North's leader is \"intent on having the capability to strike the United States of America. That is the threat.\"McCain said Trump is \"exploring all options\" but military action \"would be the last one.\"During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing later in the day, McCain also expressed serious concern about the North.\"A North Korea missile with a nuclear payload capable of striking an American city is not longer a distant hypothetical but an eminent danger, one that poses a real and rising risk of conflict,\" he said.He also criticized China for retaliating against South Korea for hosting the US THAAD missile defense system.\"China is doing all of this to stop the deployment of a missile defense system which is only necessary because China has aided and abetted North Korea for decades,\" he said.Calls have been growing in the US for curbing the North's ICBM capabilities even through the use of military force, despite repeated warnings from experts that such a strike could quickly escalate into a second Korean War as the North is sure to strike back.Last week, Graham said that the US should launch a preemptive strike on North Korea if that's what it takes to stop Pyongyang from building a missile capable of hitting the country, arguing that war with the North won't reach the US, but a North Korean ICBM could.Also Tuesday, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) said the US should use every possible means to deter the North, including military measures if necessary.\"The US will deploy every and all economic, diplomatic and if necessary, military tool at our disposal to deter Pyongyang and to protect our allies,\" he said during a think tank discussion.Gardner also urged China to do more to pressure the North.\"The road to stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies through Beijing. China is the only country that holds both the diplomatic and economic leverage necessary to put the pressure, maximum pressure on the North Korean regime,\" Gardner said during a think tank discussion.\"Beijing's reluctance to do so, however, is the reason the regime acts so boldly and with relatively few consequences. China must now move beyond mere articulation of concern and lay out a transparent path of focused pressure to denuclearize North Korea,\" he said.The senator also urged Trump to condemn China's economic retaliation against South Korea over THAAD.\"President Trump should unequivocally condemn the economic pressure by Beijing with Seoul over the deployment of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD on South Korean territory. THAAD is a defensive system and in no way threatens China and Beijing knows this,\" he said.

Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung (Yonhap)Lee said such a leader should be able to \"fight\" not only Trump, but also Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as well.The progressive mayor also reiterated that the country should cancel the deployment of an advanced US missile defense system into the country.Seoul and Washington have started steps to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea despite strong opposition from China.

(Yonhap)","1067":"The United States denied visas for North Korean diplomats set to travel to New York for unofficial talks because the half brother of North Korea's leader was \"assassinated presumably by or at the behest of North Korean authorities,\" a senior US diplomat said Tuesday.The remark by Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel is believed to mark the first time that a senior American official has publicly blamed the North for the Feb. 13 killing in Malaysia of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of leader Kim Jong-un.Russel said the killing led to the decision to deny visas for North Korean diplomats, including Choe Son-hui, director of the North Korean Foreign Ministry's North American affairs bureau, who had planned to travel to New York for talks with former US officials.(Yonhap)\"Kim Jong-nam was assassinated presumably by or at the behest of North Korean authorities by means of a chemical weapon that is banned by international convention, and under that circumstance, I think all of us got that the notion of some North Korean diplomats prancing into the United States was unseemly and untimely,\" Russel said in his farewell briefing to reporters from Asian media.Russel said the planned unofficial talks with the North Koreans were \"sideswiped\" by the killing.\"A North Korea that will commit murder by a WMD, that will threaten the use of nuclear weapons against the United States and its neighbors, and that will launch ballistic missiles repeatedly in the direction of Japan in contravention of its legal obligations under UN Security Council resolutions, is not going to look like a country that is serious about negotiations,\" Russel said.Still, he said the decision to deny visas doesn't mean the US isn't interested in talks.Russel, who is set to step down and move to the Asia Society think tank, rejected as \"unwarranted\" China's concern about the deployment of the US THAAD missile defense system in South Korea, saying the system won't compromise the security interests of any country.He said the only driver for the deployment is North Korea's threats. \"We fully expect China to always act to safeguard its security interest, but China better give us and give the Republic of Korea the same right. No one is threatening China with nuclear armed ballistic missiles. Somebody is threatening the United States and threatening Japan and threatening the Republic of Korea with nuclear armed missiles. That's the threat we're responding to,\" he said.Referring to a series of retaliatory measures China has been taking against South Korean firms, Russel urged China to \"devote the energy and leverage that it is putting into economic pressure against the Republic of Korea\" to persuading the North out of the current path, he said.When it comes to Korea policy, Russel also said that the administration of US President Donald Trump, just like its predecessors, will always be guided by the objective of achieving the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"The US will also be focused on deterring and defending against the threat of a nuclear attack or a weapons of mass destruction attack while making clear that a negotiated resolution is preferable to the alternatives, he said.

Proponents say they will take time to work. How long? Two years? Five years? Ten years? In the meantime, how many nuclear and missile tests will the North carry out? How much fissile material will it make? How many ICBMs will it field?\" Sigal said.\"It could take three years or more for the North to develop its ICBM. Cyberwarfare could at best delay the inevitable -- if that.Contemplating preventive war could rupture US alliances in Asia.The only way out of Trump's predicament is acceptance -- resume talks with North Korea, the sooner the better, to probe whether it is willing to suspend arming,\" he said.The op-ed piece reflects growing calls in the US for reopening negotiations with Pyongyang for a possible freeze on its nuclear and missile programs, as the regime has significantly accelerated its nuclear development with two nuclear tests and a number of missile launches since last year.Last month, the North test-fired a newly developed intermediate-range ballistic missile powered by solid fuel in its first provocative act since Trump took office.

The firing was largely seen as an all-too-familiar show of force against the South Korea-US annual joint military drills that kicked off Wednesday for a two-month run. But the event may also mean a fresh test for the nascent US leadership\u2019s resolve as it maps out its North Korea policy vision, expected as early as this month. Trump has called Pyongyang a \u201cbig problem\u201d and pledged to respond \u201cvery strongly,\u201d but has so far not translated words into action.\u00a0Citizens watch a broadcast of North Korea\u2019s launch of ballistic missiles to the East Sea at Seoul Station on Monday. (Yonhap)Calls have been rising in Washington to harden the approach to the headstrong Kim Jong-un regime, which could include steps such as a preventive strike on nuclear facilities, a return of nuclear weapons to South Korea and efforts to force a regime change. The mood has soured, especially after the North test-fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Pukguksong 2, last month. The New York Times reported Saturday that Trump\u2019s national security deputies recently held two meetings to explore all options, saying a reintroduction of nuclear weapons to the South would be a \u201cdramatic warning.\u201d Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported the White House had explored the possibility of military force and a regime change in its review of strategy for thwarting the regime\u2019s nuclear ambition. None of those measures seem to have much chance of becoming a concrete policy at this point, given the high risks they pose of military escalation and backlash from China, the North\u2019s prime backer.Around Seoul and Washington, however, the prevalent sentiment is that conventional approaches such as aid-for-moratorium negotiations have already proved futile, and a new idea is needed. A potential game changer is Pyongyang\u2019s mastering of technology for an intercontinental ballistic missile, which it has threatened to fire since Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s address. With the Trump administration forming its North Korea policy, meanwhile, concerns are growing here over the lack of top-level coordination in the face of President Park Geun-hye\u2019s absence from duty. The New York Times\u2019 report on tactical nuclear weapons caught some Seoul officials by surprise, though they acknowledge the fundamental need for any new administration to examine all policy options. Last year, the issue brought a headache to officials in Seoul and the US, as some leading lawmakers and scholars here relayed calls for a redeployment of the weapons and even the start of South Korea\u2019s own nuclear weapons program after Pyongyang\u2019s fifth nuclear test in September. The US withdrew tactical nuclear weapons in line with a 1991 inter-Korean denuclearization declaration. Advocates argue the bombs\u2019 reintroduction could be an effective countermove to Pyongyang, saying the text has virtually become a \u201cdead letter.\u201d The debate may heat up again ahead of a presidential election this year, with leading candidates churning out their views for and against the redeployment issue Monday. Seoul, for its part, is seeking to boost policy coordination with Washington, while speeding up the stationing of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile shield here this year. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also expected to make his first visit here late this month as part of his Asia tour that also includes stops in Tokyo and Beijing. \u201cI believe the reintroduction of tactical nuclear weapons was brought up as an option, not part of the alliance discussions, as all new administrations in not just the US but also South Korea carry out a comprehensive policy overhaul,\u201d a Seoul official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The launches took place from an area near the North's Dongchang-ri long-range missile site that Pyongyang has used to fire long-range rockets, raising fears that the communist nation might have tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.But the South said such a possibility is low.The missile launches are seen as a show of force in response to the ongoing annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States that the North has long denounced as a rehearsal for an invasion of the country.The launches also came three weeks after the North test-fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile powered by solid fuel.Weapons experts say solid-fuel missiles pose greater threats as they require less launch preparation time than liquid-fueled rockets, and can be fired from mobile launchers, which are easy to move around.The latest provocations could have an impact on the North Korea policy that the administration of US President Donald Trump is putting together. News reports said that the Trump administration is considering a wide range of options, including pre-emptive strikes.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's Day address that the North entered the final stage of preparations to test-fire an ICBM, an apparent threat that he is close to perfecting capabilities to strike the continental US with a nuclear missile.In response, Trump said the North's development of such a missile \"won't happen.\" (Yonhap)","1087":"South Korea's unification ministry on Monday strongly condemned North Korea for launching four ballistic missiles, saying that the move constitutes a blatant violation of relevant UN Security Council's resolutions.North Korea fired off the ballistic missiles toward the East Sea from near its northwestern Dongchang-ri missile site earlier in the day. They flew about 1,000 kilometers before landing in Japan's exclusive economic zone.\u00a0The Ministry of Unification said that the government strongly condemned North Korea's missile test as it poses a grave threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman of unification ministry (Yonhap)\"North Korea's missile launch is a blatant and clear violation of the UNSC resolution,\" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, said at a regular press briefing.North Korea is banned from testing any ballistic missile technology under a set of UN resolutions. Pyongyang carried out two nuclear tests last year alone and launched ballistic missiles in defiance of international condemnation.The latest launch is timed with the ongoing joint military drills between South Korea and the United States. The North has long denounced the exercises as war rehearsal for a northern invasion. (Yonhap)","1088":"North Korea on Monday fired four ballistic missiles into the East Sea, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, in an apparent reaction to the ongoing joint military drills between South Korea and the United States.The four projectiles were launched from an area near the North's Dongchang-ri long-range missile site at 7:36 a.m. and flew about 1,000 kilometers before splashing into the East Sea, JCS said in a text message.\"We estimate the North fired four ballistic missiles. We are conducting an analysis (with the US) on the missiles to determine their type and other specifications. It will take a while before we can come up with a final analysis (based on US satellite data),\" the JCS said.(Yonhap)Given the number and range of flights, the projectiles do not appear to be intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the western part of the US mainland, the defense ministry said in a press briefing. Earlier in the day, military officials raised the possibility that the projectiles could be ICBMs if launched at a high angle. Experts said the projectiles could be short-range Scud missiles with a range of 500-700 km or mid-range Rodong missiles with a range of 1,300-1,500 km given the number of missiles.\u00a0 \"If North Korea test-fired a new long-range missile, it was not an ICBM as it's not capable of launching multiple ones at the same time,\" said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Kyungnam University.\u00a0 A more than 6,000-km ICBM could fly far less than the range when launched at a high angle. But as the long-range missile is still being developed and has yet to be deployed, the North could not have fired several missiles, he said.The North test-fired a long-range ballistic missile at the Dongchang-ri or \"Sohae\" missile launch site in February last year.It launched\u00a0eight ballistic missiles, including three Musudan intermediate-range missiles, during the Foal Eagle drills last year. The missile launches invited strong condemnations.South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn slammed the North during a National Security Council meeting, saying its nuke and missile provocations are \"real and imminent threats for the people's lives and security.\"The US State Department said the North's missile launches are an explicit violation of UN Security Council resolutions that prohibit the communist state's launches using ballistic missile technology.\"We remain prepared -- and will continue to take steps to increase our readiness -- to defend ourselves and our allies from attack, and are prepared to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat,\" the State Department's acting spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said three out of the four missiles fired by the North landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.The latest provocation came a day after the US said it may consider redeploying tactical nuclear weapon systems to South Korea as a deterrent against growing nuclear and missile threats posed by the rogue regime. On Friday, Pyongyang threatened to conduct more missile firings in response to the two-month-long Foal Eagle exercise between Seoul and Washington, which lasts through April. The Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party's official newspaper, said in a commentary that \"new types of strategic weapons will soar\" if Seoul and Washington continue their annual war drills. Seoul and Washington call the annual drills on the Korean Peninsula defensive and routine. But Pyongyang claims they are a preparation for a war against it.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The communist state conducted two nuclear tests and 24 missile launches last year with the aim of eventually building long-range nuclear missiles capable of striking the US mainland.The US has considered an ICBM test by the North, if perfected, as a major threat to its homeland.\u00a0 In its previous provocations, Pyongyang launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile into the East Sea on Feb. 12 to boast its military readiness and test the response from the new Donald Trump administration.It was the first test-firing of a North Korean missile since Trump became US president on Jan. 20 and the country's first major provocation in 2017.\"We sternly warn that North Korea could face collapse if it continues its provocations despite our warnings,\" the ministry said.\u00a0(Yonhap)","1089":"SYDNEY\/TOKYO\/BEIJING -- Overseas voter turnouts for the May 9 presidential election surpassed marks set in the previous presidential poll in Asia on Sunday, the final day of their absentee voting period.Voting for South Koreans residing overseas began on Tuesday in Auckland, New Zealand, with a total of 204 polling stations in 116 countries staying open.

Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said that the measures taken by Beijing -- such as a ban on Chinese tourist groups from visiting South Korea \u2013 could constitute a violation of the World Trade Organization laws as well as the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 2015.\u00a0 Yun Byung-se (Yonhap)\u201c(China\u2019s measures) could clash with WTO rules and relevant clauses of Korea-China FTA,\u201d Yun said Sunday, appearing on state-run broadcaster KBS. \u201cIt appears to me there has been such (retaliatory) measures, but Chinese authorities have officially denied it\u2026I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to place artificial obstacles to the bilateral exchange on a civilian level.\u201d During the meeting of G-20 foreign ministers last month, the minister told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that such a measure is in conflict with Beijing\u2019s commitment to free trade and China should take \u201cappropriate action\u201d to address the concern, Yun said. His remark came amid the reports that China has instructed its travel agents to stop selling tour packages to South Korea, in an apparent response to a land-swap deal last week between the Seoul government with retail conglomerate Lotte Group to host Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries here. China, which has opposed the missile system\u2019s deployment in South Korea, has denied the report. Given that there is no specific evidence -- such as official documents -- that shows the Chinese government delivered such an instruction, officials here noted that South Korea will face an uphill battle in winning legal disputes at international tribunals.\u201cWe could consider taking it to the WTO in the light that we should raise the issue about what we are supposed to, but whether the action would help with resolving the dispute is another matter,\u201d a Seoul official told The Korea Herald on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Under the WTO dispute settlement system, a member state who wants to take a legal dispute must offer evidence that proves a violation is caused by another member state\u2019s \u201cexplicit measure\u201d before bringing the case to the settlement process.But the Chinese authority has avoided appearing to issue direct retaliatory measures.

The Constitutional Court\u2019s eight justices on Sunday continued their closed-door sessions to deliberate on the legality of Park\u2019s parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9 amid a sharp national divide over what to do with the disgraced leader. The Constitutional Court\u2019s acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi enters the court in Jongno, Seoul, Sunday. YonhapThe general consensus is that the court will unveil on Tuesday the date for the historic ruling on the nation\u2019s second presidential impeachment case. It is widely expected to be either Friday or March 13, before one of the top court\u2019s justices retires and creates another vacancy on the bench. The bench already has one vacancy after Chief Justice Park Han-chul retired in January.Rival camps for and against the embattled president are expected to make a final pitch in the coming days. A pro-impeachment protest organizer said Sunday that it will hold massive rallies in central Seoul and other major cities in the run-up to the impeachment verdict day.\u00a0 The participants will march toward the presidential Blue House and the Constitutional Court to urge the court to remove Park from office, upholding the National Assembly\u2019s impeachment motion against her.Conservative forces and Park\u2019s sympathizers will also be gathering at another massive rally to support the sanctioned leader on the verdict day, according to a pro-Park rally organizer. Police will deploy a large number of officers to keep order and prevent possible clashes between the participants of the two rallies. Since last Tuesday, the eight justices have been holding deliberation sessions to decide whether Park has violated the law and the Constitution and whether the violations are serious enough to strip her of her presidency. The sessions are to review testimony and statements, including 50,000 pages of investigation reports, of 25 witnesses through the 17 hearings in the past months, and to exchange their opinions on the case.For security reasons, the justices are said to be making two versions of the verdict --for and against the impeachment-- and vote on which one to use at the last minute.\u00a0 President Park is under 13 allegations filed up by the National Assembly last December, including that Park helped her close friend Choi Soon-sil, who holds no government post, meddle in state affairs and pursue personal gains.\u00a0 She is also under suspicion of failing to protect citizens during the deadly Sewol ferry incident in 2014, which claimed around 300 lives.The court\u2019s ruling to oust Park requires the approval of at least six of the court\u2019s eight justices.In the closing argument read out by her lawyer, the beleaguered president pleaded her innocence, reiterating her earlier stance that she has never pursued personal benefits and was not aware of irregularities committed by her aides and acquaintances, including Choi Soon-sil. Park\u2019s legal team insists that the charges raised against Park are exaggerated and fabricated based on false news reports.\u201cThere was no evidence at all (to prove Park\u2019s misdeed) when the impeachment was passed, and all that the court accepted as evidence were investigation reports which are obviously biased and in favor of the parliament,\u201d Park\u2019s lawyer Lee Joong-hwan said during the court hearing earlier. The parliament, on the other side, sees more than enough evidence to warrant Park\u2019s removal. \u201cPark\u2019s breaches of Constitution and laws are too obvious and serious,\u201d said the National Assembly\u2019s legal representative during the closing argument.

He assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father.For him, this is seen as an Achilles\u2018 heel in terms of the legitimacy of his leadership, along with uncertainty over the background of his late mother. Korean residents in Japan are viewed as \u201clow class\u201d in the North.\u201cFor Kim Jong-un, it would be important to remove Kim Jong-nam, as North Korea seeks to bolster the personality cult (of three generations of late founder Kim Il-sung\u2019s family), named the Mount Paektu bloodline,\u201d Thae added.The North\u2018s leader is seen as strengthening his reign of terror by executing more than 100 officials.

They have been ignoring the city government\u2019s continued requests to vacate the location.With regard to the tents at Gwanghwamun Square set up in 2014 for Sewol ferry disaster victims, Park made it clear that those two groups of tents have different purposes. \u201c(Keeping the Sewol ferry tents) was a humanitarian measure, not a political one,\u201d Park said, pointing out that it was the central government that had asked for the Seoul Metropolitan Government\u2019s support on the issue.A few months after the Sewol disaster in April 2014, bereaved families of victims of the ferry disaster occupied the square and staged a sit-in protest, after their requests to meet with President Park were thwarted. The city government started supporting them in July that year.In June 2016, the city said it would gradually remove tents with the protesters\u2019 permission, after City Councilor Sung Joong-gi raised the point that \u201cSewol protesters have been occupying the space for too long\u201d while Gwanghwamun Square\u2019s purpose is to serve as an area for citizens, rallies and events.In 2014 and 2015, the city collected some 5 million won ($4,370) in fines from protesters for setting up three additional tents and a sculpture without the city\u2019s approval.

(Prime Minister\u2019s Office)Should the court uphold the ouster of the suspended president, the nation will face an earlier-than-planned presidential election within 60 days.During the religious gathering, the acting president made few remarks on current issues, but his presence itself was viewed in a political light.Since it was initiated by Christian leaders in 1968, the national prayer meeting has always involved the attendance of the sitting president, regardless of his or her religion. The most committed to the occasion was former President Lee Myung-bak, who was a council member of a Presbyterian church.Consisting of religious leaders and a number of high-profile Christian figures, the meeting has often functioned as a place of social communication for state leaders.But due to her suspension, President Park became the second president to be absent from the event.The other was former President Roh Moo-hyun, who also faced an impeachment trial in 2004 for an alleged breach of political neutrality. The liberal president, however, was reinstated later upon the court\u2019s dismissal of the charges.Some observers claimed that Hwang\u2019s presence and speech at the event could be a run-up to his presidential aspiration, highlighting his recently increasing public appearances as the president\u2019s proxy.On the previous day, which marked the nation\u2019s 98th Independence Movement Day, Hwang deplored the nation\u2019s divide and vowed stern action against North Korea\u2019s provocations -- messages which would normally come from a state chief.Meanwhile, the acting president saw some rise in his support rating, catching up with South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung.According to a survey conducted by pollster Realmeter, Hwang\u2019s support rating stood at 14.6 percent in the first week of March, up 3.7 percentage points on-week.His liberal rival An gained 14.5 percent, down 4.4 percentage points during the same period. The front-runner was once again Moon Jae-in, former head of the Democratic Party of Korea, who recorded 35.2 percent of support.

The court decision on whether to oust Park is expected to come between March 10 and 14.Investigators also confirmed they will send 17 more suspects to trial, over their alleged connection to the presidential corruption case. The list included key Samsung officials, as well as Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee. This puts the total number of indicted suspects indicted at 30, the largest-ever since South Korea first introduced an independent counsel system in 1999. As for the detailed results of its past 90 days of investigation, the team is to make an official report Monday, Lee said.The billionaire heir to the Samsung Group is now indicted on charges including funneling tens of millions of dollars to nonprofit foundations run by Choi in exchange for political favors that would help him tighten his control over the company.The group\u2019s controversial merger between two affiliates in 2015 was allegedly made with the help of the state-run National Pension Service, the largest shareholder of Samsung C&T;, which is one of the affiliates. Other charges against Lee include having provided -- or pledged to provide -- a total of 43 billion won ($37.5 million) to Choi\u2019s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, in the form of sponsoring her equestrian career in Germany. In connection to the investigation, four other senior executives of Samsung, including corporate strategy office Vice Chairman Choi Ji-sung and President Chang Choong-ki, were indicted on the same day.Also on the arraignment are the so-called \u201csecret doctors\u201d of President Park, including the general practitioner Kim Young-jae and former presidential consulting physician Kim Sang-man -- both of whom are accused of secretly performing cosmetic treatments on the president -- the former President of Ewha Womans University Choi Kyung-hee and other professors for allegedly giving favors to Choi\u2019s daughter in university admission. As for Choi, who was indicted by state prosecutors last November on charges of abuse of power, coercion and attempted fraud, the probe team said it has added more charges against her, including taking bribes and concealing criminal proceeds. In the meantime, the special prosecutor\u2019s probe into Park\u2019s former aide Woo Byung-woo still remains unresolved, though it is ready to be handed over to state prosecutors from Tuesday. Woo had allegedly abetted -- or at least condoned -- Choi\u2019s attempted fraud and abuse of power while serving as a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016. Following massive street rallies amid South Korea\u2019s biggest political corruption scandal, President Park approved the launch of independent counsel Park Young-soo\u2019s team last December before she was suspended of powers. In addition to Tuesday\u2019s indictment, the probe team had indicted 13 high-profile figures, including Choi, former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Choo Yoon-sun.

Behind them are Park supporters, holding taegeukgi and crying out against the state chief\u2019s impeachment.

On each of the two occasions, Park claimed to have had no knowledge of the wrongdoings of her confidante Choi Soon-sil. She also asserted that the charges raised against her were politically motivated.As the president attended neither the impeachment trial, nor responded to the special prosecutors\u2019 summons for questioning, a speech in full public view is likely to be her last chance of affecting the nation\u2019s sentiment.Meanwhile, her lawyers made last-minute efforts to deter the top court from leaning toward impeachment, claiming that the current evidence and circumstances are insufficient to oust the state leader.\u201cA \u2018considerable\u2019 level of suspicion should never be enough to acknowledge a president\u2019s impeachment,\u201d said Lee Joong-hwan, one of Park\u2019s lawyers, citing the lack of evidence to back Park\u2019s faults.\u201cAn impeachment trial should be based on judicial judgment, not political ones, so the president may not be ousted simply for \u2018not doing so well\u2019 in politics.\u201dIt is also possible that the president\u2019s legal representative may once again file a complaint at being judged by an eight-member Constitutional Court.The top court is currently chaired by acting Justice Lee Jung-mi, due to the retirement of former Chief Justice Park Han-chul in late January.But in the wake of reports that the Supreme Court\u2019s Chief Justice Yang Sung-tae may soon appoint a justice, Park\u2019s aides have been calling for a delay in the impeachment ruling until the Constitutional Court is under a full nine-member court again.As for rumors that the president may choose to step down voluntarily before the impeachment ruling so as to avoid the dishonor, the political circle remains skeptical.\u201cPresident Park\u2019s (tactic) of delaying the court ruling as much as possible is no longer valid, so it seems that the conservative camp shall henceforth focus on exerting pressure on the court\u2019s justices,\u201d said Rep.

Kim Dong-sik, a former North Korean spy who defected to the South after being captured in 1995, said the apparent assassination case bears a hallmark he had rarely seen in the North, which has boasted a long history of terror tactics ranging from poisoned needles to disguised car accidents. \u201cThe (Kim Jong-nam) case is different from previous ones.

After attacking Kim Jong-nam, the suspects walked away and quickly washed their hands, according to Malaysian police. At the same conference, Yoo Dong-ryul, head of the Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, a Seoul-based national security think tank, claimed that Kim Jong-nam suffered from financial troubles and asked his younger brother Kim Jong-un for living expenses.

He's killed many, many individuals in some of the most brutal means possible,\" he said.In an attempt to consolidate his grip on power since taking over as leader following the death of late leader Kim Jong-il in late 2011, the North's leader has executed a number of senior government and military officials, including the 2013 execution of his own uncle Jang Song-thaek.

In 2015, the number of illegal riders stood at 42,289, paying about 1.5 billion won in fines.(Yonhap)The most frequent tricks were bypassing the turnstiles without tagging a metro card, going through the special turnstile designed for the handicapped or tagging someone else\u2019s transportation card.The rise was especially conspicuous in the number of those using the discount pass of a family member -- who is either aged 65 or above, a student or physically handicapped -- according to Seoul Metro.\u201cWhile the number of those who hopped on a train without tagging a metro card seems to be diminishing, those who use someone else\u2019s card to receive a price discount has largely gone up,\u201d said the SMRT official. \u201cSenior passes, only distributed to citizens 65 years or older, are frequently used by elderly people at a younger age, or even by their grandchildren.\u201dAnother subway official said it is physically difficult to crack down on such illegal riders, as it frequently leads to quarrels between subway staff and passengers.\u201cEven when they are caught, many of the illegal riders refuse to give their personal information and even reproach subway staff members for levying fines on them,\u201d a Seoul Metro official surnamed Park who works at City Hall station told The Korea Herald.\u201cClashes often break out as we are neither the police nor have the official right to interrogate passengers,\u201d Park added.According to the Seoul Institute released report last year, 724 billion won worth of extra burden is needed each year to manage Seoul\u2019s subway operations during times of congestion.To reduce the burden, Seoul\u2019s subway operators should consider adopting a differential fare system, charging passengers more during peak times, the report suggested.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","1134":"The Argentine Embassy last week promoted the country\u2019s flagship Malbec wine at a tasting event in Seoul.

Malbec originated in Bordeaux, Cahors and Loire Valley in France, and was imported to Argentina in the mid-19th century by French agronomist Michel Aime Pouget. With the help of Italian and French immigrants, the grape seedlings quickly adapted to local terroirs and produced grapes even better than those of France, according to Wines of Argentina.Malbec has a full-bodied flavor -- characterized by its dark velvet color and balsamic aroma -- due to its robust tannin structure, and goes well with Korean barbecue and other dishes, the envoy said.Argentine wine exports to Korea topped $4 million last year, a 7.3 percent on-year increase. The South American country is the fifth-largest wine producer in the world, with 35 percent of its farmland cultivating Malbec and half of its total wine export comprised of Malbec.Seventeen Argentine wineries and 15 Korean importers participated in the event in Seoul, including Trapiche and Finca Las Moras imported by Keumyang International; Trivento, Clos de los Siete and Flecha de los Andes by Kiljin International; Kaiken by Nara Cellars; Bodega Callia by Dongwon Wineplus; and Alta Vista by Les Vins de Maeil.

(Yonhap)After the group of 13 North Koreans fled to the South en masse in April last year, the lawyers asked the spy agency six times to allow them access to the defectors. The NIS, however, rejected the request, saying the defectors do not want to have a meeting with them.The NIS had protected the defectors without sending them to a state-run resettlement facility, saying that the case was a very high-profile defection and Pyongyang was using it as propaganda tool.Usually, North Korean defectors receive three months of resettlement education at the Hanawon facility after coming to South Korea.The lawyers claimed that the defectors should be brought to court to testify whether it was their will not to have a meeting with them. The court, however, said it is a matter to be proved by the NIS.The spy agency has argued that there is no point in carrying out the suit as the defectors are no longer under its protection and have resettled in South Korea since August.

Rumors also have it that he may been dismissed from his post.South Korea's defense ministry earlier said that it is closely watching whether Choe may have visited China to soothe Beijing's possible anger over the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of Kim Jong-un.Kim Jong-nam, the first son of Kim Jong-il, was killed on Feb. 13 at an airport in Malaysia after being attacked by two Asian women with toxic substances. Kim was believed to have close ties to China.The North's current leader is seeking to prevent any figure from wielding excessive power in a bid to maintain his one-man leadership. He has strengthened his reign of terror by using purges and executions to keep his officials in check.In November 2015, Choe was sent to a rural farm as punishment for his mishandling of a power plant project, but he was reinstated a few weeks later.

Cory Gardner (R-CO) (Yonhap)Kim Jong-nam was killed on Feb. 13 at an airport in Kuala Lumpur after being attacked by two Asian women with what appears to be a poisonous substance. According to Malaysian police, a total of eight North Koreans are suspected of involvement in the killing.The killing, coupled with the North's test-firing of an intermediate-range ballistic missile earlier this month, has given rise to strong calls in Congress for putting the communist regime back on to the list of states sponsoring terrorism.\"The murder of Kim Jong-un's half-brother is yet another reminder of North Korea's brutality. I am in support of relisting North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism,\" Gardner said in response to a question from Yonhap. \"That's why I formally asked the Treasury Department to work with the State Department to investigate whether North Korea meets the criteria for re-designation.\" Last week, Gardner and five other senators sent a joint letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, calling for greater pressure on the North, including expanding and tightening sanctions on the North and investigating whether the North merits designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"It's important that we prioritize the North Korean threat and pursue all available options, including secondary sanctions against entities that do business with Pyongyang, to put pressure on the regime and address its aggressive behavior,\" Gardner said.North Korea was put on the US terrorism sponsor list for its 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Airlines flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the U.S. administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Last month, Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) introduced a bill in the House of Representatives calling for adding the North to the terrorism list. The legislation was referred last week to the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.After the North's missile test, Poe also issued a statement calling for the North's designation.\"Once upon a time, the United States had North Korea on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. It is time to put little Kim back on that list because he is a world terrorist and a threat to world peace, and he has earned that distinction,\" he said.Calls had spiked for putting the North back on the list after Pyongyang was found to be responsible for the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. But the State Department did not do so, saying relisting would only be symbolic without significant practical consequences.The department left off the North from its latest terror sponsor list released last year, saying the regime in Pyongyang \"is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean Airlines flight in 1987.\"The State Department has shown no reaction to last week's assassination of Kim Jong-nam, referring queries to Malaysian authorities. It also declined comment on the calls for the North's re-designation as a terror sponsor.

President Park, although named an accomplice to multiple crimes allegedly committed by her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and aides, has not been indicted due to the presidential privilege of criminal immunity. But once she leaves the office -- by the Constitutional Court\u2019s finalization of her parliamentary impeachment or voluntary resignation -- she becomes an ordinary person, subject to investigation, indictment, criminal trial and punishment.Floor Leader Chung Woo-taik of the ruling conservative Liberty Korea Party (Yonhap)Mindful of this, Floor Leader Chung Woo-taik of the ruling conservative Liberty Korea Party, formerly Saenuri, on Wednesday called on fellow lawmakers to come up with measures to deal with the \u201cnational schism,\u201d which is unlikely to end even with the court\u2019s decision on Park\u2019s fate. Asked by reporters Wednesday whether he shared the idea with Cheong Wa Dae, Rep. Chung neither admitted or denied it, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s leave this.\u201d The top court is widely expected to decide by March 13 whether Park deserves to be removed from her position. Before the parliamentary impeachment of Park on Dec. 9 last year, the conservative party had pushed for an \u201corderly exit\u201d of the president, suggesting April as the ideal time for her departure and June for the next presidential election.The lawmaker maintains that a judiciary decision is more likely to further divide society and said the party would consider proposing the plan again. Floor Leader Joo Ho-young of the People\u2019s Party also hinted that a voluntary resignation of the president before the court\u2019s decision could be a way to stabilize the nation, which is witnessing rival rallies every weekend for and against the scandal-ridden conservative leader. \u201cThe judiciary solution is very likely to bring a political war, which is why we should work to find a better solution that would unite the people,\u201d Rep. Joo said after the party meeting. Other opposition parties are firmly against any deal with Park, stressing that she deserves dismissal and nothing less. Moon Jae-in, a leading presidential candidate from the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, flatly rejected the idea, calling it a veiled attempt to shift the blame for the current political crisis to the opposition. Rep. Park Jie-won, chief of the runner-up liberal People\u2019s Party also said Wednesday it is already too late for the president to step down from office voluntarily.

Two front-runners vying for South Korea\u2019s presidency are locking horns in a rare philosophical debate over the question. The spat began with a controversial remark by South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung from the liberal opposition Democratic Party of Korea about the failures of the two conservative presidents. \u201cI think they (Presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak) tried to govern well for the citizens and those from the lower part of the social ladder. But it just did not work out the way they desired,\u201d An said Sunday, in a meeting with university students in the southern city of Busan.\u00a0From left: An Hee-jung, Moon Jae-inHe went on to say that President Park, who was impeached by the parliament, may have had good intentions when she helped her friend Choi Soon-sil to raise donations for Choi\u2019s two foundations. \u201c(Park\u2019s support for the fundraising of) the K-Foundation and Mir Foundation may have started from good will to help prepare for the successful hosting of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics,\u201d the liberal governor said. Both the nation\u2019s prosecution and an independent counsel appointed to investigate the president\u2019s scandal defined the act as an extortion of money. Park was impeached by the National Assembly in December over the abovementioned accusations and others, including one that she allowed her friend Choi to meddle in state affairs. As controversy arose over An\u2019s remarks, the presidential hopeful sought to defend himself, saying, \u201cMy purpose was that, those with good intentions might also get into trouble if they do not follow the law and principles.\u201d In a rare criticism of his rival, Moon Jae-in, a former chief of the Democratic Party, took issue with An\u2019s perception of justice, saying he missed an important element of justice -- anger. \u201c\u2018Rage\u2019 is an initiating point for justice and the strong feeling against injustice is what leads to the will to uphold justice,\u201d Moon said Monday. An responded the next day that \u201crage\u201d is a dangerous feeling for a leader to have. Even the phrase, \u201cleader\u2019s rage\u201d may bring bloodshed, he warned. Moon fought back Tuesday, saying the rage he meant is not directed at individuals.\u201cThe rage we feel now is not about people, but about injustice. The great will for change and reform in South Korean society is only triggered from such heated minds,\u201d he said. An ultimately apologized and ended the debate.\u201cWhat I wanted to say was that, accepting the opponent\u2019s opinion and good will is the way to lead a productive dialogue to solve problems. I admit I went too far by giving a wrong example of a corrupted president and apologize to citizens,\u201d he told reporters. Moon commented that An\u2019s apology well reflects the public sentiment and that An\u2019s remarks were misunderstood.\u201cBecause he stressed the importance of unity and integration, he may have slipped in his explaination. But I think we agree that rage does not exist for its own sake nor should it be directed at another person. It should be a source of motivation to the development of South Korea,\u201d Moon said. The rare spat between the two liberal candidates, who have so far displayed fondness for each other even in the competition, captures where the two differ in their political philosophy and campaign strategy, observers say.

Inbound tourists numbered 1.23 million last month, compared to 1.38 million tallied the previous year, according to the Korea Tourism Organization.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The tally of Chinese visitors plunged 40 percent on-year to 360,782 from 601.671, followed by a 24-percent on-year fall from Hong Kong and a 14.8-percent decline from India, the KTO said. As widely expected, the Chinese vacuum dragged down the overall tourist tally for the cited month, which came as Beijing imposed a ban on the sale of tours to South Korea starting March 15 in apparent retaliation for Seoul's planned installation of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.The cumulative tourist tally of Asia's fourth-largest economy stood at 3.7 million in the first three months of this year, up 3.2 percent from the same time in 2016. However, the on-year figure for Chinese tourists shrank 9.2 percent to 1.51 million in that period. The gain from Japan and Southeast Asian countries helped cushion the Chinese decline, which posted moderate double-digit growth on average from a year ago, except for a slight fall from the Philippines, the agency said. Tourists from Taiwan also soared nearly 30 percent in March from the previous year on the back of a government and industry-led drive for incentive tours and promotional campaigns, it added. As for the outbound tourists, the number rose 23.7 percent on-year to 1.94 million in March, on firm demand for overseas travels, according to the KTO.

Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, U.S. Army Photo by Capt. Allison Flannigan. (Yonhap)David H. Patterson Jr., the chief of the Eight Army Public Affairs, told Yonhap News Agency.\"At this time, the MRAP fielding plan is on schedule and will be completed by the end of February 2017,\" Patterson said. \"MRAPs provide soldiers (with) a more durable battle proven armor configuration and provide improved crew survivability.\"Noting that the deployment decision was made by the US Department of the Army, the senior officer pointed out that US Army units throughout Korea, including Camp Casey in Dongducheon, north of Seoul, and Humphreys, south of the capital, will receive the MRAPs.MRAPs with V-shaped, blast-deflecting hulls were mobilized to counter threats from improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, and other roadside explosives during high-risk missions in the Middle East, which used to be carried out mostly by High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicles, or Humvees.With the winding down of major ground operations in the Middle East, the US military has been grappling with the issue of how to utilize the high-maintenance vehicles. Some damaged MRAPs have reportedly been sold as scrap metal.The deployment came amid growing talk of possible instability in the North under Kim Jong-un. Observers say that the leader in his 30s appears to be unpredictable and reckless, carrying out a slew of provocative acts since he took the reins of power upon his father's death in late 2011.Last year alone, Pyongyang conducted two nuclear tests and launched 24 ballistic missiles and long-range rockets. The provocations resulted in two UN Security Council resolutions entailing tougher-than-ever sanctions that have deepened the regime's international isolation and economic hardships.On Feb. 12, the North sharply raised military tension by testing a new intermediate-range ballistic missile. A day later, Kim Jong-nam, the North's current leader's half brother, was killed in an apparent assassination.Further fueling the talk of instability is a growing number of defectors, including those from the North's top echelons. Seoul has cited the defections as a telltale sign of \"cracks\" in the communist state's governing system.Observers said that MRAPs could be employed in case of a regime collapse or an armed conflict during which allied troops might have to maneuver across the border strewn with landmines and other explosive devices. MRAPs can also be used for security operations in enemy territory where ambush attacks with roadside bombs could be mounted, or for a post-conflict stabilization campaign north of the inter-Korean border, experts pointed out.\"The MRAPs are very useful military vehicles that can be employed when there is a need for ground forces to move quickly across the heavily fortified border and rapidly carry out ground-based operations in the North,\" Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University, told Yonhap News.\"In case of sudden developments, speedy movement is critical. MRAPs will help transport ground troops into the North if need be, given that we cannot only rely on the capability of the Air Force to transport forces effectively,\" he added.

The provocation highlighted North Korea's nuclear issue as one of the most pressing security challenges facing the new US administration.The sources said that the South Korean foreign minister stressed that a mere freeze on North Korea's nuclear program would be meaningless mainly because the country is believed to be already in possession of dozens of nuclear weapons and a freeze of North Korea's highly-enriched uranium program may be hardly verifiable. \"The (South Korean) government regards it as meaningless to pursue a freeze deal when North Korea shows no intention to give up its nuclear weapons program although freezing its nuclear facilities would be part of the inevitable process before the complete, verifiable and irreversible (nuclear) dismantlement,\" the sources told Yonhap News Agency. During the meeting, Yun also expressed Seoul's skepticism about opening any dialogue over North Korea's demand to sign a peace treaty, the sources said. Pursuing talks with North Korea simultaneously on denuclearization and a peace treaty would give the regime an excuse to delay its denuclearization, Yun was also quoted as telling Tillerson. The foreign minister then underlined the importance of maintaining the on-going pressure-oriented diplomacy toward North Korea, suggesting broader sanctions on North Korea and Chinese firms doing business with the North. He also called for continuing pressure on North Korea's human rights violations as a desirable policy approach toward the reclusive country, according to the sources. Yun's policy stances are likely to be put to discussion when the South Korean and US representatives on the North Korean nuclear issue hold a meeting in Washington possibly before the end of this month. Foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said later, \"The South Korean and U.S. foreign ministers shared in specific details in their first talks what our side thinks with regard to the two countries' joint response to North Korea's nuclear (development). \"In follow-up to the ministerial talks, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs Kim Hong-kyun will travel to the US in the near future to put the puzzle together on the matters of joint response,\" he noted. On the occasion of Kim's US trip, a separate three-way dialogue including Japan is also reportedly being planned.\u00a0 The spokesman said as of late, a total of 52 countries have joined in condemning North Korea's launch of an intermediate ballistic missile on Feb. 12, along with six international organizations. This marks three times the number of countries that condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launches in June and a test-fire of a submarine-launched ballistic missile in August, he added.

Noor Hisham Abdullah, the Malaysian director general of health (Yonhap)Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il, died last week in an airport in Malaysia after being attacked by two Asian women with what appears to be poisonous substances. He was waiting for a flight to Macau where his home is located.\"We have to confirm with the lab report before we can make any conclusive remark,\" he was quoted as saying by AP, asked if there was any sign that he had been poisoned.Malaysian police said Sunday they would give two weeks to Kim's next of kin to claim the body. No family members have come forward to identify his body, the report said.Malaysian police arrested Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man, in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam on Friday following the arrest of three others, including the two women who seemingly attacked the deceased.The police said they are searching for four more North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the same day of Kim's death.North Korean top envoy to Malaysia Kang Chol denounced Malaysia's probe results showing that at least five North Korean suspects were allegedly involved in last week's death of Kim Jong-nam.He accused Malaysia of \"colluding and playing into the gallery of external forces,\" in its probe, referring to South Korea.South Korea's unification ministry on Tuesday rejected North Korea's claim, calling it \"preposterous and sophistic.\"\"The envoy's comment on South Korea is a preposterous claim that is not even worth countering,\" a ministry official said.A diplomatic row is deepening between North Korea and Malaysia over the death of Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il and the estranged half brother of Kim Jong-un.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak denounced Kang's comment, stressing that the probe would be fair.\"The statement by the ambassador was totally uncalled for. It was diplomatically rude. But Malaysia will stand firm,\" the prime minister was quoted as saying by Reuters.Malaysia's foreign ministry said in a statement Monday that its government viewed the criticism by Kang as \"baseless.\"South Korea said that it is highly likely that the North Korean regime is behind the latest killing, given Pyongyang's track record of committing terrorist attacks and inhumane acts.Foreign media reports said that Kim Han-sol, the son of the murdered Kim, may have arrived in Malaysia on Monday from Macau, where Kim's mother and his sister Kim Sol-hui were hiding presumably under China's protection.Remarks by Malaysian officials, however, hinted that Kim Han-sol might have not arrived in the country.

Overseas card spending includes purchases made with debit and direct payment cards, in addition to credit cards.The hike was driven by a rise in the number of South Koreans going overseas last year.Official data showed that 22.38 million South Koreans went abroad last year, up 15.9 percent from a year earlier.Still, the amount spent with each card fell 11.7 percent on-year to $305, the BOK said.Meanwhile, card spending by foreign visitors in South Korea increased, though each visitor spent less.The amount of card spending by non-residents in South Korea came to $10.7 billion last year, up 6.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the central bank.The number of foreign issued cards used in South Korea jumped 33.8 percent on-year to more than 54 million, but the amount spent on each card plunged 20.4 percent on-year to $198.

McMaster will become the national security adviser. He's a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience. I watched and read a lot over the last two days. He is highly respected by everyone in the military, and we're very honored to have him,\" Trump said at his Florida resort.Trump said he met with many people as he looked for a successor to Flynn, including John Bolton, former ambassador to the United Nations. \"We'll be asking him to work with us in a somewhat different capacity,\" Trump said of Bolton. \"We had some really good meetings with him. Knows a lot. He had a good number of ideas that I must tell you I agree very much with. So we'll be talking with John Bolton in a different capacity.\" (Yonhap)Bolton, known for his hard-line stance on North Korea, has been considered for secretary of state and other jobs so far. He has been talked about as a candidate for deputy secretary of state.The announcement came a week after Trump's first national security adviser, Flynn, resigned in less than a month after taking office, after revelations surfaced that he discussed sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador to Washington even before he officially took office.Flynn was also found to have lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his contact with the Russian envoy.His departure had raised concern about the vacancy of the top national security job at a time when the US grapples with a string of security challenges, including North Korea's test-firing of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile.A graduate of West Point, McMaster received a doctorate in American History from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\"During more than three decades of service in the Army, he has played key roles in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and as a captain in the Battle of 73 Easting during the Gulf War,\" the White House said in a statement. McMaster earned the Silver Star for his valor during the Gulf War, and prior to accepting the appointment, he served as director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center and as deputy commanding general at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, it said.Little is known about McMaster's views on Korea.\"I would just like to say what a privilege it is to be able to continue serving our nation,\" he said. \"I'm grateful to you for that opportunity, and I look forward to joining the national security team and doing everything that I can to advance and protect the interests of the American people. Thank you very much.\" (Yonhap)","1149":"North Korea's apparent killing of the half brother of leader Kim Jong-un, a glut in coal production and other factors could have led Beijing to suspend coal imports from North Korea, a US expert said Monday.China suspended North Korean coal imports Sunday through the end of the year in accordance with the latest UN Security Council resolution adopted in December to punish Pyongyang for its fifth nuclear test in September. (Yonhap)The resolution centers on putting a significant cap on North Korea's exports of coal -- the country's single biggest export item and source of hard currency. The cap was set at whichever is lower between 7.5 million tons or $400 million.The suspension of coal imports also came days after the death of Kim Jong-nam, North Korean leader Kim's half brother, in what is believed to be an assassination by the regime in Pyongyang, which some experts saw as an affront to China as Kim Jong-nam was close to Beijing. \"This latest action could be a demonstration of discontent with North Korea's suspected murder of Kim Jong-nam for whom the Chinese were providing protection. China is also experiencing a coal glut announcing conterminously a shutdown of hundreds of Chinese coal mines,\" said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The expert also noted China's recent agreement to import 4,000 metric tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas from North Korea for the first time, which could become an additional source of foreign currency for the government in Pyongyang. The agreement may also provide China with additional reasons to supply North Korea with crude oil for processing, he said.\"The impact of the coal ban on North Korea will not be immediate as it benefited from record earnings ($408.5 million) in coal exports to China\" in the fourth quarter of last year, he said.Cha said Beijing could circumvent its own import ban by utilizing a \"humanitarian exemption\" loophole in the sanctions, just as it continued to import North Korean coal by exploiting the \"livelihood purposes\" exemption.

The cap was set at whichever is lower between 7.5 million tons or $400 million.\"The suspension of coal imports will hurt Pyongyang's pockets -- coal is responsible for around half of North Korea's foreign-currency acquisitions -- and increase pressure on the regime,\" Time magazine reported from Beijing.\"One likely consequence will be a spike in illicit methods of currency generation, especially cybercrime. North Korea already has an elite force of 6,800 state hackers who are engaged in global fraud, blackmail and online gambling, together generating an estimated annual revenue of $860 million,\" it said.Sheena Greitens, an expert on East Asia affairs at the University of Missouri, was quoted as saying that the North's illicit activities have always been highly adaptable, and cybercrime would likely become a higher priority if other avenues of revenue generation are closed off.The North's cyber capabilities have been a greater focus of US attention since a massive hacking attack on Sony Pictures, which Pyongyang is believed to have carried out in retaliation for Sony's release of a comedy film ridiculing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. (Yonhap)","1151":"US President Donald Trump should negotiate a freeze on North Korea's nuclear production as well as its nuclear and missile testing, even though completely ending the program should be the goal, the New York Times said Monday.The paper made the case in an editorial, arguing that \"only a new round of engagement, backed by tougher sanctions, may hold any promise\" and warning that the North now possesses the fuel for perhaps as many as 21 nuclear weapons and is steadily building its ability to deliver them with missiles\"Mr. Trump fancies himself a dealmaker. If he takes the time to consult the experts and approach the issue with discipline, he might have a chance at a negotiated solution in which the North could be offered inducements like the lifting of sanctions, economic assistance and a permanent peace treaty to replace the Korean War armistice,\" the editorial said.\"Ending the North's nuclear program needs to be the goal, but realistically what's potentially attainable is a freeze on nuclear fuel production and on missile and nuclear testing. Time is not on Mr. Trump's side,\" it said. (Yonhap)The editorial reflects growing calls in the US for stopping the communist nation from further bolstering its nuclear and missile arsenal, as the regime has significantly accelerated its nuclear development with two nuclear tests last year.In October, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also said that denuclearizing North Korea \"is probably a lost cause\" and the best possible solution to the North Korean nuclear issue may be \"some sort of a cap\" on the regime's nuclear capabilities.But many experts, including former State Department diplomat David Straub, say the US should never settle for a freeze because it would amount to accepting the North as a nuclear weapons state and undermine the global nonproliferation regime. Even if the North agrees to a freeze, the regime would still be running its nuclear and missile programs at undeclared facilities while rejecting full verification by outside experts, Straub said.Past nuclear deals with the North were all about freezing the program, but all failed, he said.Robert Gallucci, who negotiated the 1994 nuclear freeze deal with Pyongyang, also told a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing earlier this month that the US should not seek anything short of North Korea's complete denuclearization, saying a freeze is \"unrealistic and dangerous.\"Entering into negotiations with the North without the US declaring its goal of a non-nuclear North Korea would \"appear to have the United States legitimize the North's nuclear weapons status, and thus increase the likelihood that before too long South Korea and then Japan would follow suit,\" Gallucci said.

The new federal state was then composed of the four provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Since the confederation, Canada has undergone numerous territorial changes and expansions, resulting in the current configuration of 10 provinces and three territories.Members of the Korean Association for Canadian Studies and staff of the Canadian Embassy, including Political Counsellor Patrick Hebert, pose for a photograph at the association\u2019s general meeting at the embassy in Seoul on Friday.

Some key events planned by the embassy this year are a creative writing contest in the spring for Korea\u2019s elementary, middle and high school students, who will submit short stories on a theme related to Canada, which will be reviewed by a panel of Canadian authors. At the Busan International Short Film Festival in late April, Canada will participate as a guest country, presenting 30 movies and bringing 10 filmmakers and producers. In June, Canadian authors will visit Korea and feature their books at the Seoul International Book Fair, also as a guest country.\u00a0In May, a specialized tour of the embassy, with food tasting events and video streaming, will be held as part of Jeongdong Culture Night festival. Around July 1 Canada Day, a day of national celebration, the embassy will organize a festive\u00a0event for the public. In Canada, the sesquicentennial anniversary will be used as a launching pad for numerous events -- everything from a cross-country recreational vehicle tour to an extravaganza on the Parliament Hill -- with a half billion dollars spending by the federal government. The largest share of the money, $300 million, will be delivered by regional development agencies through the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program, a government fund used to revamp public facilities and community infrastructure. \u201cCelebrating the 150th anniversary, the Korean Association for Canadian Studies will host seminars for popularizing Canadian studies in Korea,\u201d said Lee Seung-ryul, the association president and professor at Korea Aerospace University. \u201cTo this end, we will translate works of Canadian writers into Korean, publish books on Canadian studies and establish courses related to Canadian studies in liberal arts across universities.\u201dAmong the participants in the meeting were Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Province education superintendent, Lee Gi-chun, former Vancouver consul general and Korean ambassador to Argentina, and Huh Sook, former president of Gyeongin National University of Education in Incheon.The association, established in 1992, is an official member of the International Council for Canadian Studies with some 40 board and 200 general members.

And a mysterious poison that kills within hours. It\u2019s the perfect recipe for a thrilling cloak-and-dagger spy novel. Except some _ or possibly even all _ of this tale could be true in the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the older half brother of reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. And just like similar intriguing cases from the past, the public is hanging on to every detail because there\u2019s just something about murder by poison that captivates. \u201cA gun announces its mischief; poison can sneak in with a sip of champagne,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t why we are fascinated with this latest story, it\u2019s why wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201dStill, speculation that Kim Jong-nam was killed by two young female \u201cagents\u201d at the busy Kuala Lumpur airport last week left even the most seasoned toxicology sleuths shaking their heads. Add in that the portly sibling was apparently sprayed in the face with a substance so potent it killed him before he could reach the hospital, and you\u2019ve got a scene straight out of a James Bond movie. Four people, including the two women _ one Indonesian and the other traveling on a Vietnamese passport _ have been detained. Conspiracy theories and speculation abound as police scramble to unravel what really happened to Kim Jong-nam, aged 45 or 46, the son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and a mistress. After falling out of favor with the family, the son lived for years in exile and was about to catch a flight to Macau when the attack took place. He sought help at the airport clinic after suddenly falling ill and died en route to the hospital. An autopsy has been performed, but the results have not been released.If a chemical agent really was to blame, finding it may be the hardest part of all. \u201cThe more unusual, the more potent, the more volatile a poison is, the less likely it is to be detected,\u201d said Olif Drummer, a toxicologist at Australia\u2019s Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine who has spent 40 years in the field.Experts routinely tasked with finding answers in poisoning cases say the events at Kuala Lumpur\u2019s budget airline terminal are bizarre, but not impossible. They wonder: What substance could have been used to kill the victim so quickly without sickening the women who apparently deployed it, along with anyone else nearby? Difficult, they say, but doable. \u201cIt\u2019s not an agent that could be cooked up in a hotel room. It\u2019s going to take a lot of knowledge regarding the chemical in order to facilitate an attack like this,\u201d said Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida. He said a nerve gas or ricin, a deadly substance found in castor beans, could be possible. A strong opioid compound could also have been used, though that would likely have incapacitated the victim immediately. \u201cIt would have to be cleverly designed in order to be applied in this fashion without hurting anyone else,\u201d Goldberger said.\u00a0 History is filled with poisoners. From jilted lovers seeking revenge to greedy spouses looking to collect on life insurance policies. Arsenic, cyanide and strychnine are often the toxins of choice used in murders, but political hits are usually a much more complicated business. Take the Cold War case of Bulgarian defector and journalist Georgi Markov. He was jabbed in the leg with an umbrella in 1978 at a bus stop in London. He died three days later, and a pellet of highly toxic ricin was found under his skin _ shot there by a gun concealed inside the umbrella.\u00a0 No one was ever arrested, but Bulgarian secret police were suspected with help from the Soviet KGB. The Kremlin has been implicated in a number of high-profile cases including Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy who fled to the United Kingdom and was lethally poisoned by radioactive polonium-210 in 2006. In a report published last year, a British judge wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the assassination carried out by the country\u2019s security service. And just this month, another loud Putin critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza, fell into a coma and was diagnosed with \u201cacute intoxication by an unidentified substance.\u201d The Russian nearly died from a similar unexplained poisoning two years ago.\u00a0 Though the dramatic cases linked to espionage tend to make headlines, many other killings are overlooked entirely.\u00a0 \u201cTo me, murder by poison is the easiest thing to get away with,\u201d said John Trestrail, a forensic toxicologist who has examined more than 1,000 poisoning crimes. \u201cIf all those people in the cemetery who have been poisoned could raise their hands, we\u2019d probably be shocked.\u201dWhile murder using toxins is far less common than stabbings and shootings, he said his research shows that poisoners often strike more than once. \u201cThese people get away with it time and time again until somebody says, \u2018Well, hell, she\u2019s had four husbands and they all died suddenly,\u201d\u2018 Trestrail said. \u201cThen the exhumations come and: Bingo!\u201d (AP)","1161":"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday North Korea should fully comply with UN Security Council resolutions and work toward denuclearization.Guterres made the remark when he met one-on-one with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se in the German city of Bonn on the sidelines of the foreign ministers' meeting of the Group of 20 nations, expressing deep concern over the North's latest missile test, according to the Foreign Ministry.

Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at a restaurant in Macau in 2010. (Yonhap)Oriental Daily News, a Malaysia-based Chinese-language daily, reported that police were planning to perform a second autopsy but said it was scheduled to be conducted at 9 a.m. Saturday.The news reports came as Malaysian authorities failed to yield conclusive findings in the first autopsy on Wednesday, two days after Kim Jong-nam was killed. Malaysian police have not yet released an official postmortem report.Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who has a different mother from the current leader, was killed in an airport in Malaysia on Monday after being attacked by two women who are suspected to have used some sort of poison.It has yet to be confirmed whether North Korea was behind the latest killing, but Seoul's spy agency said Wednesday that Kim Jong-un issued a \"standing order\" to murder his sibling after he assumed power in late 2011.Kang Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, demanded that Malaysia immediately hand over the body, accusing Malaysia of trying to deceive the North while colluding with what he calls \"hostile forces\" trying to do Pyongyang harm.\"We will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance,\" the ambassador said while reading a statement in front of the mortuary of Hospital Kuala Lumpur.\u00a0\u00a0 Malaysia's police chief, Inspector-General Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, has dismissed North Korea's accusation that his government was purposely delaying the process to release Kim Jong-nam's remains, the Bernama reported.\"While in Malaysia, everyone has to obey and follow our rules and regulations ... that includes North Korea,\" Khalid was quoted as saying, adding that the police must obtain a DNA sample from the Kim Jong-nam family in order to conclude the investigation. Meanwhile, AP and Reuters reported that Malaysian police arrested and identified a 46-year-old man possessing a North Korean passport in Kuala Lumpur on Friday night in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam.According to Reuters, the man's name is Ri Jong-chol, born in 1970. Ri, the fourth suspect, was arrested on Friday night in Selangor state, according to the report. Malaysian authorities have already arrested three suspects in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam.

US President Donald Trump (Yonhap)\"As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess at home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places,\" Trump said.\"Low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas no matter where you look. The Middle East? A disaster. North Korea, we will take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess,\" he said.Complaining about information leaks, Trump said, \"All this information gets put into the Washington Post, put into the New York Times. What's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really really important subjects like North Korea? We've got to stop it.\"Refusing to answer how he's going to deal with Russia's recent provocative actions, Trump again mentioned North Korea as he argued that publicly revealing strategies to deal with such problems is not a good idea.\"I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know,\" he said.These were the latest in a series remarks Trump has made about North Korea in recent days, especially after Pyongyang test-fired a newly developed intermediate range ballistic missile in its first provocative act since Trump came into office last month.That appears to show that North Korea weighs on his mind.On Monday, Trump called the North \"a big, big problem\" and said he will deal with it \"very strongly.\"After summit talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, Trump said that defending against the North's nuclear and missile threat is \"a very very high priority\" for him.Trump also held a late night joint press conference with Abe on Saturday, just hours after the North's missile launch, to reaffirm the US commitment to defending the ally in the face of North Korean threats, though he stopped short of directly condemning the launch. (Yonhap)","1164":"South Korea has nearly the worst air quality among advanced economies, with its level of fine dust soaring over the past 25 years, a report revealed Thursday. According to the \u201cState of Global Air 2017,\u201d a report by nonprofit environmental group Health Effects Institute in the United States, the nation\u2019s average population-weighted concentration level of PM2.5 -- which refers to ultrafine particles or particle matter with a diameter of at least 2.5 micrometers -- was 29 micrograms per cubic meter in 2015, above the average 15 micrograms for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.\u00a0Fine dust covers the cityscape of Jongno-gu and Lotte World Tower in Jamsil, Seoul, on Thursday. (Yonhap)South Korea\u2019s reading trailed only Turkey among the OECD. The study showed the dust problem grew worse in South Korea, while the OECD average had improved in the past 25 years. In 1990, the PM 2.5 figure was 26 micrograms, compared to the OECD average of 17 micrograms. When compared to other Asian countries, the quality of air in Korea is more polluted than Japan and Singapore, which scored 13 micrograms and 19 micrograms, respectively. China recorded 58 micrograms, followed by North Korea at 34 and Laos at 33. The latest survey came as South Koreans debate the cause of the deteriorating air condition, crucial for deciding on measures to curb it. While many have pointed to China as the main culprit, the South Korean government highlights emissions from diesel engine cars and business sites dealing with construction waste or using solid fuel. The Environmental Ministry last June came up with fine dust countermeasures, including a weekly no-driving campaign and gradually cutting down on benefits given to diesel car owners, with an aim of improving the country\u2019s air quality to levels equivalent to European countries in 10 years. However, the government\u2019s plan did not gain wide support from the public.A survey of 1,000 citizens conducted by the state-run Korea Environment Institute last September showed that 53.1 percent of Koreans were dissatisfied with the government\u2019s handling of the fine dust situation, while 55.2 were worried about the current dust concentration. \u201cI have always thought the fine dust came to Korea through wind from China. Instead of blaming the citizens for causing the dust, the government should make more efforts to stop its influx from China,\u201d Kim Hee-jung, a university student said. An online community site was also established last May where members gather to demand solutions to the dust problem from the government. In less than a year, membership had expanded to some 30,393 across the country.While high population density and rapid industrialization are also cited as driving the high concentration of fine dust in South Korea, citizens raise questions as to the possible influx of the harmful particles from outside the peninsula.In early January, a separate study conducted by the KEI showed that about 70 percent of fine dust particles found in South Korean skies came from neighboring Northeast Asian countries such as China.Pundits and analysts said that for a more accurate analysis on the impact from other countries, more data needs to be shared between them. \u201cI cannot say the KEI\u2019s conclusion about (the source of) 70 percent of the fine dust in the country is perfectly accurate. However, it is true that China may have influenced the concentration level of the dust in Korea,\u201d Park Jong-gil, chief of the Atmospheric Environmental Information Research Center of Inje University, said. \u201cChina is not so fond of giving (others) their meteorological information, which makes it hard us to compare the elements of fine dust in the two countries.

The special counsel filed the lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court last Friday after its attempt to enter the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae to collect evidence was halted by her aides earlier this month for security reasons.Foreign tourists look on from the photo zone of the fine dust-blanketed presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Dec. 5, 2016. (Yonhap)Independent Counsel Park Young-soo sought to suspend and nullify the presidential aides' rejection. But after an hour-long hearing Wednesday, the court dismissed the case, concluding that the independent counsel is not qualified to file such a request. The decision can't be appealed, effectively precluding the prosecutors' search of the presidential office. The investigation team's spokesman Lee Kyu-chul earlier said a search of Cheong Wa Dae will become impossible if the suit is turned down by the court. Under the country's law, military facilities and other areas that handle confidential information cannot be searched without approval from the person in charge of the location. The law, however, prohibits the person from refusing to grant such consent unless it infringes upon key national interests.The probe team said it will clarify its stance during a regular press briefing on Friday afternoon.A presidential aide welcomed the court's decision.\"It is a fair decision in line with the law,\" the aide told Yonhap News Agency over the phone. \"The court made a stern judgment with regards to what special prosecutors excessively pushed for, taking advantage of the public sentiment (against the impeached president).\" On the same day, the special prosecutors asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend their investigation by one month.

In a seminar hosted by the Federation of Korean Industries to discuss risks posed by North Korea's evolving nuclear and long-range missile threat, security experts said the US, if provoked sufficiently, could move to knock out key military and other strategic facilities in the reclusive country.Security experts discuss risks posed by North Korea and countermeasures in a seminar held in Seoul on April 24, 2017. (Federation of Korean Industries)\"US military attacks on North Korea depend on South Korea's attitude toward the alliance and the level of Pyongyang's provocations,\" Lee Choon-geun, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy, said in the seminar. North Korea has escalated tensions on the Korean Peninsula by conducting two nuclear tests and more than 20 missile tests last year.\u00a0 Despite such capabilities, many in Seoul want to avoid resolving the current standoff with the use of force, because of fear it can potentially lead to a military clash.They said to prevent Washington from striking the North, South Korea needs to show it is firmly committed to the alliance and the goal of denuclearization.Echoing the need to maintain calm, Song Won-geun, vice president of the Korea Economic Research Institute, a think tank under the South Korean business lobby FKI, to avoid any unintended military conflict between Washington and Pyongyang, the next government will need to pay close attention to ties with Washington.\"Close ties with the US should take precedence over all else,\" he claimed.South Korea, meanwhile, faces tough times ahead since it agreed last July with the US to install the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here by the end of 2017 to counter threats from Pyongyang. Its biggest trading partner China has explicitly opposed the anti-missile system's installation, arguing it could be used against it.Last month, Beijing banned the sales of group travel packages to South Korea as part of its retaliation against the allies' ongoing process to complete the installation within this year.Local campaigns against South Korean products in China also put a dent on South Korean businesses last month.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Still, experts here said the North won't likely cross the Trump government's \"implicit red line\" that could trigger a decisive action by the US military. (Yonhap)","1169":"The murder of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, could have been engineered by a North Korean faction loyal to the current chief to eliminate a possible threat to the regime, South Korean experts said Wednesday. In interviews with The Korea Herald, the pundits also asserted that the killing may have been motivated by Kim Jong-un\u2019s concern that the elder Kim may seek political asylum in other countries and become the most high-profile dissenter of the Stalinist regime. The views were contrary to the assessment of South Korea\u2019s top spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, which told lawmakers Wednesday that the incident is presumed to have been based on Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201cparanoia\u201d about his older half-brother, rather than a calculated decision. \u201cIn order to show their loyalty to the leader Kim, some fervent subordinates might have acted on a tacit order from him to take out Kim Jong-nam\u201d said Ahn Chan-il, director of the World North Korea Research Center and former North Korean military officer who fled to South Korea in 1979.\u00a0 Photos of the two unidentified women who allegedly attacked Kim Jong-nam, as reported by local mediaKim Jong-nam, 47, died Monday after being attacked with poison by two unidentified women at a Kuala Lumpur airport while waiting for a flight to Macau, where his family members live, according to Malaysian police and the NIS. It has not yet been confirmed whether North Korea was behind the attack.Ahn noted there must have been an \u201curgent need\u201d to assassinate Kim Jong-nam, adding that the Kim Jong-un may have been extremely unnerved by the possibility that his outspoken, flamboyant half-brother might seek asylum in South Korea and western countries. In 2012, there was a rumor that Kim Jong-nam considered defection to South Korea. Recently a local media reported that South Korea had tried to negotiate his defection, but the effort failed due to differences over the terms and conditions. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, said the very report could have angered Kim Jong-un, prompting him to order assassination of what he viewed as \u201creal threat\u201d to his leadership. \u201cWithout approval of Kim Jong-un, assassination of Kim Jong-nam never would have happened,\u201d said Cheong. \u201cIf the elder Kim blackmailed the younger Kim with a threat to defect, Pyongyang\u2019s leadership would have chosen to assassinate him, instead of considering a compromise.\u201dChung speculated that General Bureau of Reconnaissance, Pyongyang\u2019s intelligence agency which manages the communist state\u2019s clandestine operations against South Korea, may have orchestrated the murder, saying the agency is in charge of taking out dissenting officials and has been spying on Kim Jong-nam. Earlier in the day, the NIS said the killing of Kim Jong-nam had been a \u201cstanding order\u201d for North Korean agents since 2012, when he reportedly sought asylum in South Korea. The intelligence service added that Kim Jong-nam also asked Kim not to kill him and his family members. Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies, agreed that Kim Jong-un might have took a \u201cspecific step\u201d that led to the assassination, speculating that the deceased may have tried to come to South Korea or refused to return to the North in defiance of the leader\u2019s order. \u201cI suspect Kim Jong-nam definitely did something that hurts the reputation of North Korea\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, which the North viewed as the most serious crime,\u201d said Yang. \u201cDefection attempts, refusal to obey the order\u2026 anything could be possible.\u201d\u00a0North Korea`s leader Kim Jong-un(left) and his half brother Kim Jong-nam.

He had stayed in China for a while and later moved around South East Asian such as Malaysia and Singapore.But the experts dismissed the idea that Kim Jong-nam was a Chinese favorite pick to replace the current leader in the event of insurgency in the North, saying that the scenario was \u201cscrapped\u201d after Kim Jong-un executed his uncle Jang Sung-thaek, a pro-Chinese high-profile official. For this reason, analysts predicted little impact from Kim\u2019s death on the North\u2019s relations with China, but Pyongyang will face international condemnation and risk being branded a state sponsor of terror by the US again. Washington took the North off the terrorism sponsor list in 2008.\u201cElecting Kim Jong-nam as a replacement for Kim Jong-un is an old narrative from before the execution of Jang,\u201d said Ko. \u201cAs opposed to worsening relations with China, (Kim\u2019s death) could enhance North Korea\u2019s image as a rogue state.\u201d(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","1170":"The US State Department said Tuesday it is aware of reports that the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been killed in Malaysia, but declined any further comment.\"We are aware of reports.

The textbook guideline, posted on Tokyo's e-government website for public view before the official announcement, will apply to elementary school textbooks from 2020 and to middle school books from 2021.Dokdo (Yonhap)Currently, Japan is teaching its elementary and middle school students in social studies textbooks that Dokdo, called Takeshima in Japan, is its territory. But this is the first time that Tokyo specified the claim in the legally binding educational guideline. The guideline, which is usually revised every 10 years, serves as a state-enforced standard for writing textbooks. The move came in spite of strong protest from South Korea last month when it was reported that Japan's education ministry was pushing to revise the guideline to include its sovereignty claims to the islets. Dokdo, which lies closer to South Korea in the East Sea, has long been a source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since its liberation from Japan in 1945 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.The revision came amid deepening diplomatic friction over a statue, symbolizing the victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women, recently erected in front of the Japanese consulate in South Korea's southern port city of Busan. Tokyo demanded the immediate removal of the statue and called home its ambassador in protest last month. The ambassador has not come back to Seoul.

And none of them are good,\" the senator said. \"We must do almost whatever it takes, just about anything, to prevent Kim Jong-un from acquiring the nuclear capability he can deliver against the mainland of the United States of America.\"Calls have been growing in the US for militarily taking out the North's ICBM capabilities, despite repeated warnings from experts that such a strike could quickly escalate into a second Korean War as the North is sure to strike back.Last week, a ranking Republican senator, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), also said that the US should launch a preemptive strike on North Korea if that's what it takes to stop Pyongyang from building a missile capable of hitting the country.\"It would be terrible but the war would be over here (there), wouldn't be here,\" Graham said with a gesture with his fingers. \"It would be bad for the Korean Peninsula. It would be bad for China.It would be bad for Japan, be bad for South Korea. It would be the end of North Korea.

Also, the sanctions have prevented one of the restaurants from selling kimchi through local shopping malls.This provided photo shows a North Korean restaurant in Cambodia that has closed. (Yonhap)Cambodia hosts the biggest number of North Korean restaurants except for China. Ten restaurants from the North have opened since 2003, when Pyongyang Cold Noodle Restaurant was launched in Phnom Penh. Half of them, however, were closed as of the second half of last year.The noodle restaurant specializing in \"naengmyeon,\" or cold buckwheat noodles, has ceased to offer kimchi to two shopping malls operated by Japan's retail giant Aeon and a Hong Kong-Cambodia joint venture.A source said the two shopping malls have decided not to deal with North Korean-made foodstuff due to anti-North Korean sentiment, adding, \"the annual sales from the malls are not so big at about $20,000. But it goes to show that North Korea is feeling the pinch, even in such a traditional ally as Cambodia.\"The Cambodian government expressed concern about the North's nuclear and missile tests and urged the North to stop raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula twice last year.Cambodia is seen as keeping its distance from the North. It rejected the North's invitation to Prime Minister Hun Sena to visit Pyongyang and a visit to the Southeast Asian nation by North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong and North Korean ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam in the first half of last year.

(Yonhap)\"These launches are in grave violation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's international obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions,\" said the statement issued after the council held an emergency meeting on the issue.The North fired off a new intermediate-range ballistic missile from an air base in the western province of North Pyongan early Sunday. The South Korean military said the missile reached a height of 550 kilometers and flew about 500 km before splashing into the East Sea.The Security Council members \"deplore\" all the North's ballistic missile activities, as such activities contribute to the North's development of nuclear weapons delivery systems and increase tension, the statement said. \"The members of the Security Council reiterated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall refrain from further actions, including nuclear tests, in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, and comply fully with its obligations under these resolutions,\" the statement said.The council also called on all UN member states to fully implement sanctions on the North.\"The members of the Security Council agreed that the Security Council would continue to closely monitor the situation and take further significant measures, in line with the Council's previously expressed determination,\" the statement said.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also denounced the North's missile launch as a violation of Security Council resolutions and urged the communist regime to abide by its international obligations.\"The secretary-general strongly condemns the launch of another ballistic missile by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 12 February,\" Farhan Haq, deputy UN spokesman, said in a statement. \"This action is a further troubling violation of Security Council resolutions.\"The DPRK leadership must return to full compliance with its international obligations and to the path of denuclearization.

(Yonhap)Trump did not elaborate on specific strategies to deal with Pyongyang.Still, the remark shows Trump seriously takes the North's growing nuclear and missile threats.After summit talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, Trump said that defending against the North's nuclear and missile threat is \"a very very high priority\" for him.Trump also held a late night joint press conference with Abe on Saturday, just hours after the North's missile launch, to reaffirm the US commitment to defending the ally in the face of North Korean threats, though he stopped short of directly condemning the launch.The North's missile launch marked the first provocative act by Pyongyang since the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.The launch came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile apparently capable of reaching the US.Experts said the latest firing could be aimed in part at testing how the Trump administration would react to a missile launch before the regime goes ahead with a full-fledged ICBM test that Trump has pledged to prevent from happening.On Monday, the North said the launch represented a successful test of a newly developed intermediate-range missile powered by solid fuel. Weapons experts say solid-fuel missiles pose greater threats as they require less preparation time than liquid-fueled rockets, and can be fired from mobile launchers easy to move around. (Yonhap)","1177":"The US State Department said Monday that North Korea's ballistic missile launch is unacceptable and urged countries around the world to take steps to show Pyongyang consequences for its action.\"We call on all states to use every available channel and means of influence to make clear to the DPRK and its enablers that launches using ballistic missile technology, or efforts to advance North Korea's ballistic missile capabilities, are unacceptable,\" a department official said on background.(Yonhap)\"We further call on all states to take steps to show there are consequences to the DPRK's conduct. We call on the DPRK to refrain from provocative, destabilizing actions and rhetoric, and to make the strategic choice to fulfill its international obligations and commitments and return to serious talks,\" the official said.The official also noted that multiple UN Security Council Resolutions explicitly prohibit the North's launches using ballistic missile technology or further development of its ballistic missile programs. \"North Korea's weapons programs represent a clear, grave threat to U.S. national security. North Korea openly states that its ballistic missiles are intended to deliver nuclear weapons to strike cities in the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan,\" the official said.The US reaffirms its \"ironclad commitment\" to the defense of allies, including the provision of extended deterrence, and will continue to develop a comprehensive set of alliance capabilities to counter the growing North Korean ballistic missile threat, the official said.Following the missile launch, the US special envoy for North Korea policy, Amb. Joseph Yun, spoke with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts and affirmed close coordination with the two countries, the official said.The Defense Department said the US is capable of defending against North Korean threats.\"We are capable of defending against a North Korean ballistic missile attack and will take all necessary measures to deter and defeat threats to our and our allies' territories and citizens,\" Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said.The North carried out the missile launch on Sunday morning local time in the first provocative act by Pyongyang since the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.The launch came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile apparently capable of reaching the US.Noting that the launch was not an ICBM test, experts said the firing could be aimed in part at testing how the Trump administration would react to a missile launch before the regime goes ahead with a full-pledged ICBM test that Trump has pledged to prevent from happening.On Monday, the North said the launch represented a successful test of a newly developed intermediate-range missile powered by solid fuel.

The resolutions focused on curbing the inflow of hard currency to the regime. It also came as North Korea plans to take part in the Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan, which will be held from Feb. 19 to 26.The sanctions led some countries to impose exports bans on North Korea over such sports equipment as skis, yachts and mountaineering boots, he said. The blockade of money transfers also prevents fund assistance which the International Olympic Committee provides for sports development in member countries.\"The thing is that sports firearms can never be turned into rockets nor rockets be fired from them,\" Kang said.Pyongyang has yet to express its intent to take part in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to be hosted by South Korea. But the games' top organizer has said that South Korea will welcome North Korean participation. (Yonhap)","1179":"North Korea on Monday claimed its latest intermediate-range missile test heralded the birth of a \u201cnew strategic weapon system,\u201c triggering a UN Security Council emergency meeting and international criticism, including from China. The Pukguksong-2, which flew some 550 kilometers before falling into the East Sea on Sunday, was a result of efforts led by leader Kim Jong-un to develop a land-based ballistic missile with a greater range built on the experiment of a submarine-launched ballistic missile last August, the official Korean Central News Agency said.\u00a0The young ruler himself observed the liftoff at the Banghyon launch site, expressing \u201cgreat satisfaction over the possession of what another powerful nuclear attack means,\u201d the KCNA said. South Korea, the US and Japan, which have issued strong condemnations, requested the UN Security Council convene an emergency meeting to discuss its response to the latest provocation, Seoul officials said. The session is expected Monday afternoon in New York. China also displayed \u201cclear opposition\u201d to the test later in the day. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said while the North\u2019s nuclear program is an issue between Washington and Pyongyang, and Seoul and Pyongyang, Beijing also \u201cfeels responsible\u201d and will continue to resolve it with the US and other countries.The launch proved the \u201creliability and security\u201d of the surface launch system powered by high thrust solid fuel engines, as well as the missile\u2019s guidance and control features including during the re-entry phase, as it can be \u201ctipped with a nuclear warhead,\u201d the KCNA noted. The Rodong Sinmun, another state mouthpiece, ran dozens of images of the leader, a new transporter-erector-launcher and the missile soaring from a cylindrical tube, spouting out flames. \u201cNow our rocket industry has radically turned into high thrust solid fuel-powered engine from liquid fuel rocket engine and rapidly developed into a development- and creation-oriented industry, not just copying samples,\u201d the KCNA quoted Kim as saying. \u201cThanks to the development of the new strategic weapon system, our People\u2019s Army is capable of performing its strategic duties most accurately and rapidly in any space -- under waters or on the land.\u201dSolid fuel, which Pyongyang claimed to have developed last March for the first time, may boost the projectile\u2019s mobility and make it more difficult to be detected before being launched, compared to liquid fuel. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff acknowledged a fresh type of missile and solid fuel were used during the test, after mistakenly assessing Sunday it was an existing mid-range Rodong and then an advanced version of the longer-range Musudan.\u00a0 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un observes the launch of the Pukguksong-2 medium-range ballistic missile from Banghyon air base in North Pyongan Province on Sunday. (Yonhap)Seoul officials, meanwhile, are ramping up diplomatic efforts to craft countermeasures both on international and regional levels, while continuing to send strong messages to the recalcitrant neighbor. Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn condemned the missile launch as a violation of UNSC resolutions and \u201cgrave provocation,\u201d during a meeting with foreign investment firms earlier in the day, vowing to ensure a stable business environment and asking for active investment. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, who is expected to meet with new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later this week in Bonn, Germany, called the test a \u201cnew level of provocation\u201d and \u201cpreview\u201d to further provocations. Ministry of Unification spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee also said the experiment yet again underscored the \u201cgravity of military and security threats\u201d from across the border. The provocation will likely have an impact on the US\u2019 Donald Trump administration, which is believed to be carrying out a review of its North Korea policy. At a resort outing, the new president and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hosted an urgent news conference and blasted the test. With Pyongyang drawing closer to securing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the US mainland, Washington may seek to sharply toughen its line against the Kim regime including through secondary sanctions and military action, observers say. Ahead of his confirmation, Tillerson also picked North Korea as a leading threat, pledging to adopt a \u201cnew strategy\u201d that would keep \u201call options on the table, from the threat of military force to the willingness to remain open to diplomacy.\u201d Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser, called the two leaders\u2019 joint appearance \u201ca show of strength,\u201d adding the administration would be \u201csending another signal very soon\u201d to Pyongyang.\u201cThat signal is when we begin a great rebuilding of the armed forces of the United States,\u201d Miller said in an interview with CBS on Sunday, which would show \u201cunquestioned military strength beyond anything anyone can imagine.\u201d The latest test may also complicate China\u2019s efforts to upend a decision to install the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in South Korea. Pyongyang\u2019s increasingly sophisticated capabilities could only bolster the allies rationale behind the plan, while undermining that of Beijing, which has been criticized for not doing enough to thwart its unruly ally\u2019s nuclear ambition. Some experts even argued that THAAD is virtually the only currently available system capable of intercepting a North Korean missile fired from such a higher angle as in Sunday\u2019s event. But the Chinese ministry\u2019s Geng was adamant that THAAD and the missile launch should be considered \u201cdifferent matters,\u201d saying the system\u2019s deployment would not help resolve the other issue.

The official said the military is mulling over live firing the Hyunmoo-2A with a range of more than 300 kilometers or the Hyunmoo-2B with a range of over 500 km. It is also considering publicizing photos or video of the missile launch.\"There is also an opinion in the military that it will be more effective to unveil the test-firing scene of a new 800 km ballistic missile which is in the final stage of development,\" the official said.The Hyunmoo missiles are a core asset in the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan. The KMPR directly targets the North's military leadership with the aim of neutralizing key figures and infrastructure if there are clear signs of the imminent use of nuclear weapons, according to the ministry.In recent years, the military has test-fired newly developed missiles on the heels of Pyongyang's provocations. The communist regime conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches last year alone.

He also said defending against the North's threats is a \"very very high priority.\"The two sides also issued a joint statement strongly urging the North to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and not to take any further provocative actions. They also reaffirmed their commitment to fully implement UN sanctions on Pyongyang.

But they spent much of the two-hour discussion at the KBS broadcasting station on political and ideological offensives and the disclosure of past scandals involving opponents.The five major presidential candidates pose before their third round of TV debate on Sunday. The next debate is scheduled for Tuesday.\u00a0(Yonhap)The prime target at the outset was Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party whose past confession of his role in a friend's attempted rape 45 years ago got fresh attention ahead of the May 9 election. Sim Sang-jeung, the nominee of the minor progressive Justice Party, opened fire by declaring she would not engage in a debate with Hong.\"I cannot recognize a candidate who was an accomplice in a sex crime as a rival candidate,\" she said. \"It would be natural for Hong to resign in consideration of the shame felt by the people and national prestige.\"Hong, a former prosecutor and provincial governor, wrote in an autobiographical essay in 2005 that he provided an animal aphrodisiac powder to a friend who wanted to rape a coed while he was a law student at Seoul's Korea University.The candidate apologized again, saying he feels responsible for not stopping his friend. But he also expressed frustration that the issue was being brought up again even after his \"confession.\"Front-runner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party was pressured to clarify allegations the government of then-President Roh Moo-hyun consulted North Korea before abstaining from a UN vote on a North Korean human rights resolution in 2007. Moon served as Roh's chief of staff at the time. Moon reaffirmed the Roh administration decided to abstain before notifying the North of the decision.Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party asked Moon whether he would quit the race if his remarks turn out to be a lie. Earlier in the day, Moon's campaign unveiled former presidential aides' memos to counter the claim. The documents indicated Roh had decided on Nov. 16 that year not to join the vote in consideration of improving inter-Korean ties, and notified Pyongyang of the decision on Nov. 19. But Song Min-soon, the then-foreign minister who first raised the allegation in his memoir in October, countered that the decision was only provisional and the discussion continued until Nov. 20 just before the vote was conducted the following day.Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party continued to skewer Moon in what appeared to be an aggressive push to beat his rival in their second matchup in five years.The two candidates competed for liberal votes in the 2012 presidential race before Ahn dropped out in support of Moon. Ahn, who is now the runner-up in opinion surveys, criticized Moon for employing negative tactics including branding him as an \"avatar of MB.\"MB is the initials of former conservative President Lee Myung-bak who was in office from 2008-2013.\"In the previous election, I yielded my candidacy. That was because I was determined that the Lee Myung-bak administration should not be extended,\" Ahn said. \"(You) told me something similar back then as well. Am I still an avatar of MB?\"'Moon dodged answering directly, saying he had heard such talk but had nothing to say in response to rumors.\"If it's not true, explain why it isn't true,\" he said. \"Don't look toward me but look toward the people. Are you in politics (simply) to oppose me?\"He later said that he doesn't agree with the \"MB avatar\" accusation.Hong chimed in, scolding them for quarreling over petty issues.\"Watching the two of you, I can't tell if it's an emotional fight between elementary school children or a presidential debate,\" he derided.The election watchdog is scheduled to hold two more debates on economic and social issues before the election. (Yonhap)","1183":"Ahead of the presidential election, debate over the Kaesong Industrial Park is expected to kick into high gear this year as leading contenders call for a resuscitation of the symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement. One year after the park\u2019s closure, the issue remains highly contentious across society, with cross-border exchanges at a standstill and the losses of 123 forced-out South Korean firms snowballing.\u00a0The Kaesong Industrial Park in North Korea is seen from South Korea\u2019s Dorasan Observatory in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. Yonhap The complex, meanwhile, was only the last of a growing list of instruments for inter-Korean cooperation that fell victim to Pyongyang\u2019s unbridled nuclear and missile provocations. The sanctions regime has become broader, more comprehensive and multifaceted, both worldwide and regionally. Without progress on North Korean denuclearization, a move to reopen may require Seoul to undermine its own argument that some of the proceeds from Kaesong have been siphoned off for military uses, officials say. Differing views As the one year anniversary drew near, leading presidential candidates showed a slight disparity in their views over the complex\u2019s resumption. The tradition has been that conservative parties back a hardline approach focusing on sanctions and pressure, whereas the liberal opposition call for dialogue and cooperation as incentives for North Korea to change tack. But the line has blurred. Opposition frontrunner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea and Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung argue for the park\u2019s immediate reopening. Others, including opposition big shots such as South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung and former People\u2019s Party chair Ahn Cheol-soo, have a more reserved stance, saying they support the joint factory operation in principle but its immediate reopening is implausible. Moon, who served in the administration of late progressive President Roh Moo-hyun, went a step further, saying on his Facebook account Thursday that if elected, he will scale up the industrial complex tenfold to 66 million square meters. Lee blasted the closure as a breach of the law that made way for its establishment, saying it has pushed the businesses \u201cto the brink of bankruptcy.\u201d At a seminar last month, An said a South Korean leader cannot decide to reopen the park at a time when the international community is tightening sanctions against the communist state, and thus collective discussions are needed before making the decision. But his spokesman Park Soo-hyun said more recently that the governor, if elected, will pursue its resumption, siding with the companies and their workers. Ahn has raised \u201cpractical difficulties\u201d for a speedy restart due to UN sanctions, saying he would seek \u201ccomprehensive talks\u201d with Pyongyang to deal with the nuclear and Kaesong issues altogether. \u201cLook at the UN sanctions, there are difficulties regarding our cash payment and items that could go into and come out of (the North),\u201d he told reporters last Thursday, apparently referring to a UN resolution banning \u201cbulk cash\u201d transfers. \u201cIf we don\u2019t follow the sanctions, we would be sanctioned too.\u201d The view was echoed by conservative contenders such as Rep. Yoo Seong-min and Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the Bareun Party, which spun off from the ruling Saenuri Party. \u201cBefore North Korea changes course in the nuclear and missile issues, it would be hard to make progress on economic and humanitarian exchanges,\u201d Yoo said at a conference with foreign correspondents on Friday. Consensus mismatchWhether a restart of the Kaesong complex would constitute a violation of UN Security Council resolutions remains a source of contention. But they include a few possible snags other than the bulk cash clause, such as one that forbids member countries from opening branches of their financial institutions within the North. As for the next South Korean president, a greater challenge would be to match domestic sentiment with international consensus. In a recent poll commissioned by the National Assembly to Gallup Korea, nearly 76 percent of the respondents said the complex\u2019s shutdown did not contribute to peace on the peninsula and the development of inter-Korean relations. Almost 55 percent supported its reopening, while around 35 percent said in favor of its closure. But if Seoul unilaterally reopens the complex, it would not only trigger controversy over a sanctions breach but also face difficulties in rallying other countries behind a fresh international resolution should Pyongyang stage another major provocation. Mindful of the controversy, Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said that the shutdown is likely to have dealt a \u201csubstantial blow\u201d to the regime by cutting a cash flow amounting to $100 million a year. \u201c(The decision) has provided a chance for the US, Japan, European Union, Australia and other nations to strengthen their individual sanctions, and played a decisive role in inducing the international community\u2019s strong pressure,\u201d he told reporters Friday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck also said a day earlier that without clearing concerns over the regime\u2019s diversion of Kaesong profits, a restart would only cause controversy over a possible violation of UNSC resolutions. \u201cWhether you like it or not, as we have come this far on this global sanctions and pressure drive, it would be unwise for us to announce the park\u2019s resumption or sell it as an election pledge,\u201d a Seoul official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \u201cWhile it\u2019s important to maintain flexibility toward its reopening, we need to leave it as our leverage for future inter-Korean talks, since we would have to raise the nuclear issue as part of the agenda.\u201d\u00a0By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1184":"The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Sunday that it would install malodor reduction devices in 10 more places in the capital to prevent bad smells wafting from waste pipes.

Officials said many of the farmers had skipped vaccination on fears of side effects on milking and giving birth by their cows, but the government came under fire for shoddy management. Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Minister Kim Jae-soo (Yonhap)\"It is true that the existing testing system does not show the rate of antibody development for the full population of cows,\" Park Bong-kyun, head of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, said in a briefing. \"We will overhaul the method and cycle of the inspections.\"The agency has been conducting tests annually since 2010 on some 9,500 cattle farms, about 10 percent of the nation's total.Farms for testing were picked regardless of their size, with only one cow selected for verification. If the cow had antibodies, then the farm was recorded as having a 100 percent rate of antibody development. Officials said that under such a system, only 0.3 percent of the entire cattle population had been subject to inspection.Park said the agency will revise the system to test six cows per farm instead of just one and make detailed sampling to include cows of different genders and age. The tests will be increased to a maximum of four times a year from a one-time inspection, he said.The agency said the problem of farmers' negligence remains despite the proposed changes. Cows need to be vaccinated every four to seven months, but farm owners tend to avoid it, fearing losses in milk yield and problems in impregnation and giving birth, it said.\"We can't dismiss financial losses from a cow's miscarriage, but an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease will require culling of all cattle,\" Park said. \"Since the losses from such culling will be far greater, vaccination is imperative.\" (Yonhap)","1196":"Amid growing tension that the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye may be thwarted or delayed considerably, opposition parties Wednesday renewed the call for her prompt ouster, which would give way to an earlier-than-planned election.They also demanded special prosecutors be given an extra month to continue the ongoing investigation into the president\u2018s corruption allegations.The leaders of three opposition parties met Wednesday afternoon, pledging to participate in yet another massive candlelight rally Saturday.From left: Reps.

The former United Nations secretary-general last week renounced his anticipated bid in the presidential race.Sohn, 69, had retired from politics but announced his comeback in October last year and announced his presidential bid in January.His approval rating, however, has remained in the lower tier so far.A survey by Realmeter in the first week of February showed Sohn to be ranked seventh among the potential candidates, with 2.7 percent of the respondents\u2019 approval.Moon stood at 26.1 percent, taking a visible lead over runner-up Hwang Kyo-ahn, the prime minister and acting president whose approval rating was 12.1 percent.While Sohn is seen as making the last challenge in his political career, the People\u2019s Party\u2019s plan is to revitalize its imminent primary by bringing in a plausible adversary for former party chairman Ahn.For such reasons, the party\u2019s leadership, especially chairman Rep. Park Jie-won has frequently been reaching out to ranking centrist politicians to expand the party\u2019s political leverage.Sohn, too, alluded that other public figures may be following suit in joining the People\u2019s Party.\u201cThere will be a (political) big ban in February-March, though I cannot yet tell you all the details today,\u201d Sohn told reporters, apparently indicating at Kim Chong-in, the former interim chief of the Democratic Party.\u201cKim (Chong-in) told me to go ahead and lay the grounds,\u201d Sohn said, but reserved explicit answers when asked whether Kim would be joining in as well.Moon and the Democratic camp responded neither to Sohn\u2019s alluding remarks, nor to his unity with the People\u2019s Party.\u201cThe People\u2019s Party will eventually merge with our party (ahead of the presidential election),\u201d Moon said Tuesday.\u201cI hope to join hands (with the People\u2019s Party) in achieving the much-aspired change of government.\u201dBy Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1201":"More than 33 years since quitting the African Union, Morocco was readmitted to the continental club of nations, heralding a new era of regional security and economic cooperation, according to the Moroccan Embassy in Seoul.The decision was made at the 28th Summit of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Jan. 31, with the support of 39 countries and nine countries opposed in voting. Moroccan King Mohammed VI first signaled the country\u2019s wish to rejoin the institution at the 27th summit in Kigali, Rwanda, last July.

The motion calls for Yoo Il-ho, deputy prime minister for economic affairs, to attend the session on economic issues on Thursday, and for Hwang to join the non-economic session the following day. Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn (Yonhap)Hwang attended a parliamentary session in December. But he said his attendance at the time was to respond to \"citizens' calls\" to explain his policy direction and based on his understanding that the parties demanded his attendance only in the December session.Hwang took over as the acting president on Dec. 9 after President Park Geun-hye was impeached over a corruption scandal involving her and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.Opposition parties have been seen keeping Hwang in check as his name has been floated as a potential presidential contender.\u00a0Since former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon renounced his presidential ambitions on Wednesday, Hwang has been touted as Ban's replacement to carry the flag of the conservative bloc.

Closing ceremony at the Rio Olympics in Brazil (Yonhap)In February last year, the North Korean women's football team was also allowed to travel to Japan for the Olympic qualifying tournament.Japan has imposed the entry ban in light of North Korea's nuclear tests and long-range ballistic missile launches.According to Kyodo's report, the Japanese government will require all North Korean officials accompanying the athletes to submit valid proof of identity and check for any connection with the North Korean military or its ruling Workers' Party.A\u00a0Japanese foreign ministry official told Kyodo that politics and sports should be kept separate.About 20 athletes and officials have signed up for the Asian Winter Games, according to the Japanese government and the competition organizers.North Korea's joining of the upcoming Asian Winter Games may raise the possibility that Pyongyang could send its athletes to the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea.The South will host the Winter Games in PyeongChang, 180 kilometers east of Seoul and its sub-cities, in February next year.North Korea has yet to express its intent to take part in the upcoming Olympics, but the games' top organizer has said that South Korea will welcome North Korean participation.South Korea's unification ministry said that individual North Korean athletes should first qualify for the Olympics.\"Basically, whether North Korea would take part in the games will be handled in accordance with international practices, relevant regulations and procedures,\" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, said at a regular press briefing.\"But North Korean athletes will first have to qualify for the Olympics,\" he added.North Korea did not send its athletes to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2010, Pyongyang sent two players in the figure and speed skating competitions to the Winter Games in Vancouver, but failed to win medals.Experts said that North Korea's possible participation in the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics would help ease long-frayed inter-Korean tension which was sparked by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests.With \"Peace Olympics\" being one of the four main pillars for the event, North Korea's possible attendance at the Winter Games would well meet PyeongChang's stated targets, they said. (Yonhap)","1204":"WASHINGTON (AP) _ A federal appeals court denied early Sunday the Justice Department's request for an immediate reinstatement of President Donald Trump's ban on accepting certain travelers and all refugees.The Trump administration appealed a temporary order restraining the ban nationwide, saying late Saturday night that the federal judge in Seattle overreached by \"second-guessing'' the president on a matter of national security.Now the higher court's denial of an immediate stay means the legal battles over the ban will continue for days at least. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco asked challengers of the ban respond to the appeal, and for the Justice Department to file a counter-response by Monday afternoon.Acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco forcefully argued Saturday night that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States an assertion that appeared to invoke the wider battle to come over illegal immigration.\"The power to expel or exclude aliens is a fundamental sovereign attribute, delegated by Congress to the executive branch of government and largely immune from judicial control,'' the brief says. Anti-Trump protest in London, UK (Yonhap)Earlier Saturday, the government officially suspended the ban's enforcement in compliance with order of the order of US District Judge James Robart. It marks an extraordinary setback for the new president, who only a week ago acted to suspend America's refugee program and halt immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries the government said raise terrorism concerns.Trump, meanwhile, mocked Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, calling him a \"so-called judge'' whose \"ridiculous'' ruling \"will be overturned.''\"Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision,'' he tweeted.Trump's direct attack recalled his diatribes during the campaign against the federal judge of Mexican heritage who oversaw lawsuits alleging fraud by Trump University, and may prompt some tough questions as these challenges rise through the courts.But the government's brief repeatedly asserts that presidential authority cannot be questioned by judges once the nation's security is invoked.Congress \"vests complete discretion in the President'' to impose conditions on alien entry, so Trump isn't legally required to justify such decisions, it says. His executive order said the ban is necessary for \"protecting against terrorism,'' and that \"is sufficient to end the matter.''The Justice Department asked that the federal judge's order be stayed pending resolution of the appeal, so that the ban can \"ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.''The order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompted protests across the United States and led to multiple court challenges. Demonstrations took place outside the White House, in New York and near his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump was attending the annual American Red Cross fundraising gala.\"We'll win,'' Trump told reporters Saturday night. \"For the safety of the country, we'll win.''The State Department, after initially saying that as many as 60,000 foreigners from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen had their visas canceled, reversed course on Saturday and said they could travel to the US if they had a valid visa.The department on Saturday advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order will now be allowed in. A State Department official said in an email obtained by The Associated Press that the government was \"focusing on booking refugee travel'' through Feb. 17 and working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday.The Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump's order from boarding US-bound planes. The agency said it had \"suspended any and all actions'' related to putting in place Trump's order.Hearings have also been held in court challenges nationwide. Washington state and Minnesota argued that the temporary ban and the global suspension of the US refugee program harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination.In his written order Friday, Robart said it's not the court's job to \"create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,'' but rather, to make sure that an action taken by the government \"comports with our country's laws.''The Justice Department countered that \"judicial second-guessing of the President's national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large.''Robart's order also imposes harm on US citizens \"by thwarting the legal effect of the public's chosen representative,'' it says.","1205":"Senior diplomats of South Korea, the United States and Japan will meet this week seeking to chart new ways to rein in North Korea as the communist country appears to be on the verge of another nuclear provocation.The meeting scheduled for Tuesday in Tokyo will bring together chief negotiators on the North Korean nuclear issue to coordinate their responses to evolving nuclear and missile threats posed by North Korea.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The Donald Trump administration is in the final stage of the formulation of its North Korea policy which will reportedly employ \"maximum pressure and engagement.\" The trilateral talks, coming on the heels of US Secretary of State Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence's recent visits to the region, are expected to provide a clearer picture of how the three countries' joint approach toward North Korea will be shaped under the Trump administration. Mirroring the message Tillerson made during his earlier visit to South Korea, Pence again declared \"all options are on the table\" in Seoul a week earlier. His remark was widely interpreted as hinting at military action.Pence also warned North Korea against testing the Trump administration's \"resolve or strength of the armed forces,\" shown in the US air strike on Syria in reaction to the the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons on civilians.The talks will involve Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs at the foreign ministry, and his US and Japanese counterparts, Joseph Yun and Kenji Kanasugi.High on the agenda are ways to \"contain North Korea's additional high-intensity strategic provocations, maximize pressure on North Korea and secure China's constructive role\" in coping with North Korea, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last week.The ministry said that they will also discuss their coordinated message to be sent to the North at a United Nations Security Council meeting to be held this week.On April 28, Tillerson will chair a UNSC meeting on North Korea to discuss how the council could better cope with the regime's prohibited nuclear and missile programs. South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se is expected to join the meeting, which again is likely to provide a chance to further sharpen trilateral efforts to deal with the North Korean threats. The meeting coincides with the 85th anniversary of the establishment of the (North) Korean People's Army. The North usually marks key anniversaries with a military show of force, including nuclear and missile tests. South Korean officials said the country is technically ready to conduct a nuclear test at any time.Another round of nuclear tests is expected to bring North Korea close to owning a nuclear weapon small and light enough to be mounted atop a long-range missile, a goal it has pursued since its first atomic arms explosion in 2006. Its fifth and latest test was conducted in September last year.

Earlier, Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported that the carrier and its strike group is to sail to waters off the Korean peninsula after completing training drills with the Australian Navy.Pence, who is on the final leg of his Asia tour, also told media that he believes a nuclear-free Korean peninsula is possible because of the Trump administration's \"engagement\" with China.

The US supercarrier Carl Vinson will arrive in the East Sea in days, US Vice President Mike Pence said in Australia. (AFP-Yonhap)Pence, former governor of Indiana, said that all options are on the table, and China is the key to influence North Korea, adding that if Beijing is unable to \"deal\" with Pyongyang, the US and its allies will step up. Tensions have been rising as North Korea could conduct additional provocations around next Tuesday, when the communist regime celebrates the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army with a show of its military power. Experts have been saying that North Korea may conduct its sixth nuclear test. There was controversy after top US officials misleadingly said last week that the USS Carl Vinson was heading to the Korean Peninsula to deter North Korea, with Trump saying he sent an \"armada.\" But it turned out the aircraft carrier was actually moving in the opposite direction to participate in joint exercises with Australia. North Korea has responded that it is not afraid of the US forces. The Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the North Korean regime, said in a commentary Saturday that \"If the U.S. provokes the DPRK even a bit, its army and people will start a great war of justice for national reunification without hesitation.\" DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Meanwhile, the US.

At that time, Moon was the chief secretary to then-President Roh Moo-hyun, who held power from 2003 to 2008.The memoir insists that the Roh administration consulted Pyongyang before deciding to abstain from the U.N. vote.Taking the memoir-related controversy as a rare opportunity to narrow gaps with the front-runner, conservative candidates and parties intensified their offensive against Moon.The Liberty Korea Party decided to push for investigations by parliament and a special counsel into allegations of the Roh administration communicating secretly with North Korea, while Hong accused Moon of threatening Song.Ahn\u2019s election camp also issued a statement, urging Moon to listen to Song and fully disclose the truth.\u201cWhy does candidate Moon lie about his role (mentioned in the memoir)? Instead of answering Song\u2019s questions, Moon has threatened to hold the former foreign minister fully responsible. That\u2019s anachronistic,\u201d it said.In addition, Yoo, a conservative candidate, accused Moon of lying about his role in the vote abstention a decade ago.\u201cMoon\u2019s explanation can hardly be trusted as he has changed his remarks about the controversy four times,\u201d Yoo said, calling on all government agencies to disclose all relevant documents before the election day.However, Moon and the Democratic Party have launched a counterattack, urging the conservatives and other critics to focus on policy pledges and visions, instead of seeking to benefit from North Korea-related security issues.\u201cConservatives are again seeking to capitalize on the North Korea factor,\u201d Moon\u2019s spokesman, Park Kwang-on, said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them a clear warning not to use North Korea in their campaign. Ordinary citizens are already wise enough to see through their intentions.\u201dSticking to his campaign schedule, Moon on Saturday unveiled a set of energy policy pledges that include reducing coal-fired power plants and nuclear reactors in the country and expanding renewable energies.

The event took place in a tense mood, with the Saenuri chief alluding that Ban should give up on the election and Ban stressing the need for political reform.The black-and-white logic, classifying thoughts into conservative and progressive, will eventually divide the people,\u201d Ban said, letting out his disapproval over the conservative politicians\u2019 approach.\u201cOne who aspires for presidency should be able to embrace the entire nation, regardless of region, generation, social class.\u201dHe did not say much about the Bareun Party, which was considered his most likely affiliation, but had repeatedly distanced himself from it, gesturing to remain on his own for a while.Ban also blasted upon the attitude of the local media and of the rival opposition camp for finding fault with details which are extrinsic to his qualification as potential state leader.\u201cI don\u2019t see how my choice of Evian (instead of a local brand bottled water) or lack of skill in buying a subway ticket should matter in the presidential election,\u201d he said. \u201cYet, all these things make front page headlines.\u201dIt was apparently amid such mounting fatigue that he decided to renounce his much-anticipated candidacy, without even telling his closest aides.Only Kim Sook, former ambassador to the UN and closest aide to the former top diplomat, who had been given a heads up prior to the press conference, according to officials of Ban\u2019s headquarters.

Hwang has so far remained noncommittal about whether he will run in the election.\"There is a possibility of a governance vacuum triggered by a failure to handle a sudden crisis situation during (my attendance) at the parliamentary session for long hours,\" Hwang said in a press release.\"I call on the National Assembly to reconsider its request for the prime minister to appear at the session.\"Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn (Yonhap)The one-month parliamentary extraordinary session kicked off on Wednesday.

That would \"destroy US credibility not only with its allies in Seoul and Tokyo but throughout the world,\" and undermine the global nuclear nonproliferation regime, he said.\"In theory, a freeze now would stop Kim Jong-un short of his goal. Freeze supporters thus argue, as Mr. Clapper suggested, that the United States should give Pyongyang 'significant inducements' for its promise to freeze its facilities and not conduct further tests of nuclear devices and long-range missiles,\" Straub said.\"In truth, a freeze now would just be a cap in disguise. The entire international community would also regard it as such, unlike in earlier years when the North's nuclear capabilities were not as advanced and their elimination was still considered possible,\" he said.The expert also said that even if the North agreed to a freeze of its known nuclear facilities, the regime would still be running its nuclear and missile programs at undeclared facilities.Moreover, Pyongyang would be unwilling to accept full verification by outside experts.Past nuclear deals with the North were all about freezing the program, but all failed, he said.\"What reason is there to believe that another freeze effort now, with North Korea having in the meantime made clear in the strongest terms that it has no intention of giving up nuclear weapons, would fare any better? And even if North Korea agreed to a freeze, how long would we expect it to maintain it this time around?\" Straub said.\"Mr. Trump should not be fooled by this mirage, either. He urgently needs to put in place his North Korea team and proceed to apply far greater pressure on Pyongyang until it is prepared to negotiate genuine denuclearization. Only then might a freeze again be worth considering,\" he said.

Eight overpasses are awaiting removal starting this year.\u00a0Touted as a rival to New York\u2019s High Line Park, the green pedestrian park-turned-overpass Seoul-lo 7017 will stretch for about a kilometer and link seven surrounding areas including Seoul Station, Namdaemun Market and neighboring buildings to some 17 pedestrian walkways that feature 254 types of trees, shrubs and flowers from inside and outside Korea. There will also be performance stages, cafes, a library of plants, flower shops and street markets.The \u201c70\u201d in the name Seoul-lo 7017 refers to the year 1970 when the Seoul Station flyover was constructed, while 17 is a reference to the number of walkways connected to it and the year 2017 when its construction is to be completed.City officials also said it will complete construction in Jongno to extend bus-only lanes and reorganize walkways by the latter half of this year.When this is completed, nearly 2.8 kilometers of road in Jongno will have at least 10 meter-wide bus-only lanes. Ventilation openings and other installations will also be removed from the pedestrian zone.\u201cBy building more bus-only lanes and reorganizing the environment for crosswalks, it will be able to provide joy to people who walk in the area and keep traffic convenient for citizens, along with a cleaner townscape,\u201d said Kim Jun-ki, an official from Seoul City\u2019s public safety division.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","1231":"South Korea and the Unites States\u2019 defense chiefs are seeking to hold their first bilateral meeting in Seoul next month since the inauguration of new US president Donald Trump, Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday.\u00a0The ministry said it is working with Washington on a meeting between Defense Minister Han Min-koo and US Defense Secretary James Mattis, who is considering a visit to Japan and South Korea early next month, according to reports by Japanese media outlets citing US officials.\u201cWe are in talks with the United Sates to hold the bilateral meeting as soon as possible,\u201d said an official from the ministry who declined to be identified. \u201cWe have been working on the meeting since before the inauguration of President Trump.

Cho adapted into Korean \u201cThe Knight in the Tiger\u2019s Skin,\u201d a national treasure written in the 12th century by Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli.Rustaveli was a pre-eminent poet of the Georgian Golden Age, which lasted from the late 11th to the 13th century.

(Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)Georgian Ambassador to Korea Nikoloz Apkhazava (right) speaks beside Georgian Embassy Counsellor Davit Chikvaidze (center) and Counsellor Zaal Tchkuaseli. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)The epic poem speaks of friendship, courage and love involving two Indian and two Arabic soldiers. Flush with Middle Age expressions, it also offers a rare glimpse into the languages, minds and habits of medieval Georgians and royalty. Over 600 pages, the translation from Russian to Korean took over 10 years, with crosschecks from English and Japanese versions, according to Cho. \u201cWhat\u2019s very interesting about this magnum opus is that its narrative structure is very similar to the popular Korean television drama \u2018Descendants of the Sun,\u2019\u201d the professor told The Korea Herald, adding that both stories depict four warriors.\u201cI also learned that Georgia was frequently chronicled in ancient Greek and Roman mythologies. The Greek deity Prometheus is mythologically chained to a rock in the Kazbek Mountain of the Caucasus, and his liver is eaten alive by an eagle during the day, only to be regenerated at night.\u201dA portrait of Shota Rustaveli produced in 1937 by Irakli Toidze (Wikipedia)A painting of Shota Rustaveli presenting Queen Tamar a poem produced by Mihaly Zichy (Wikipedia)First printed in 1712 in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, the book -- often titled \u201cThe Knight in the Panther\u2019s Skin\u201d -- has now been translated into 47 languages. Commemorating the writer\u2019s legacy, UNESCO designated 2016 as the year of Rustaveli. The book was given to former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by the Georgian envoy to the UN. Georgia\u2019s highest prize in art and literature is the Shota Rustaveli State Prize. One of Tbilisi\u2019s main thoroughfares is Rustaveli Avenue and one can find theaters, academic institutions, subway stations, streets, squares, statues and schools named after Rustaveli throughout the country.\u201cWhat also surprised me during my translation was that ancient Georgia, an Orthodox Christian country to this day, was very tolerant toward other religions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tale shows no prejudice against other religions from India and the Middle East, demonstrating that ancient Georgians were open and willing to converge their beliefs with others.

(Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)A 17th-century manuscript of \u201cThe Knight in the Panther\u2019s Skin\u201d (Wikipedia)Noting that the author influenced many later generations of Georgian and Russian writers, Cho said 19th-century Russian romanticists Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) and Mikhail Lermontov (1814-1841) found refuge and sanctuary in the Caucasus region, where they fleshed out their literary daydreams. Georgia\u2019s stoic sierras and verdant valleys became timeless backdrops of their classic poems and novels. Cho, who has traveled to Georgia, noted that Georgia is called the \u201cLittle Switzerland\u201d of the Caucasus, with mountains soaring above 5,000 meters, picturesque lakes and gushing hot springs. Georgia was recently chosen atop the \u201c10 Hottest Travel Destinations of 2017\u201d list by Vogue magazine. \u201cThe capital, Tbilisi, with its young, creative class and Brooklynesque undertones, has emerged as the hub of cool,\u201d the magazine wrote, also noting its \u201cexciting art, music and food scenes.\u201dAn increasing number of Koreans are traveling to Georgia, attracted by its sulfuric baths, ski resorts and seaside resorts, historic attractions and cultural amenities. Georgia is also famous for its delectable gastronomies, which go well with its wines, the oldest in the world. Harking back to literature, Cho stressed that he places \u201ca lot of importance on translation,\u201d calling it \u201cthe beginning of all communications.\u201dMentioning author Han Kang\u2019s novel \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d which won the Man Booker International Prize last year through British translator Deborah Smith, the professor said Koreans\u2019 perception of translation was improving. \u201cBut we should not merely aim to win awards,\u201d he underscored. \u201cAs Korea becomes a multicultural society, we should strive to know more about the world\u2019s great literatures, so much of which has yet to be translated.\u201d By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","1244":"President Park Geun-hye cited her friend's daughter as an example of a young and gifted athlete as she ordered the establishment of programs to train emerging sportspeople, a former vice minister said Monday.The remark by Kim Chong, vice culture and sports minister from 2013-2016, implicates Park further in allegations that she abused her power to give undue favors to her friend Choi Soon-sil.

By comparison, penicillin prescriptions accounted for as high as 64.8 percent in Norway. This finding signifies that resistance to penicillin has already grown widely in South Korea and patients now require more potent antibiotics.\"The misuse of antibiotics is said to be decreasing in South Korea, but the latest research results show that it is still serious in the country compared with advanced Western nations,\" Park said. \"Doctors and patients alike have to change their thinking about using antibiotics.\"Antibiotics, although not effective against bacteria-caused infections like the cold or flu, are commonly prescribed for such illnesses in South Korea.

Do not put on your vest yet, just drag it until we are on deck, all right?\u201d an instructor told the children.The 15 people on board, including parents and children, took turns escaping down the 7-meter emergency slides.\u00a0Some had to jump into a pool of colorful balls -- as if it was the sea --because, in a real-life situation, there may not be time to wait for a rescue boat.\u201cEven adults who try escaping the ship for the first time find it difficult to stand on both feet or put on a life vest,\u201d said Lee Min-jeong, an instructor at Gwangnaru Safety Experience Center.An elementary school student uses an emergency slide during a ship\u00a0escape program at Gwangnaru Safety Experience Center in Seoul on Tuesday. Kim Da-sol\/The Korea HeraldThe center opened in 2010 with the aim of preventing loss of life in emergency situations.\u00a0The Seoul Metropolitan Fire and Disaster Headquarters invested 500 million won ($428,000) in a ship safety experience booth last summer, after growing calls from citizens in the wake of the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014.\u00a0The booth officially opens in March, but is currently being tested with people who make reservations in advance. At least six or seven groups of children and families participate in the safety experience program each day.\u00a0Lee Hee-soon, chief director of Gwangnaru Safety Experience Center, stressed that they tried to make the program -- South Korea\u2019s first official ship safety experience -- as lifelike as possible.\u00a0\u201cWith tragedies such as the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 and the continued earthquakes in Gyeongju last year, the necessity of operating down-to-earth disaster training programs for citizens was an urgent issue for us,\u201d said Lee.\u201cOur ultimate goal is to educate citizens on how to overcome an emergency or to deal with a safety accident, so they can escape unfortunate situations anywhere, anytime,\u201d added Lee.\u00a0The 30-minute ship escape training program begins with passengers boarding a life-size model of a ship.Once all passengers have boarded, an instructor demonstrates how to put on a life jacket and the steps to follow when ordered to evacuate.\u00a0Then a video is played. The front window of the ship turns into a screen showing the sea to simulate being far from the coast.\u00a0But soon the ship strikes a submerged rock, and begins slowly tilting to one side.\u201cI was so nervous when the ship started to vibrate and leaned left. I did not know what to do, even forgetting to bring my life vest to deck,\u201d said 6-year-old Kim Jin-gyu, who participated in the program.\u00a0Parents who brought children to the safety experience program said simple but fundamental instructions can allow children to quickly manage situations when accidents happen.\u00a0\u201cFollowing continued natural disasters and safety accidents, it was unavoidable for me to bring my children during winter vacation, because they can remember what to do when a real accident happens,\u201d said 37-year-old mother Hong Seo-yeon, who visited the center.\u00a0\u201c(The experience program) was as real as if I were onboard. The ship even moved up and down, back and forth,\u201d she added.\u00a0According to the center, the program can make the ship tilt to one side by up to 20 degrees, but an adult can find it difficult to stand even at a 10 degree angle.\u00a0\u201cAdults who participate in this program often say they panicked when the ship started to shake, because they have never experienced walking out or standing when a ship starts to sink,\u201d said the center official.\u00a0Other than the ship escape program, citizens can participate in experience programs for other disasters such as earthquakes, fires and typhoons.\u00a0While the center is frequented by children from kindergarten and elementary school, instructors say it is also important for parents and adults to come to the experience.\u201cThe number of visitors seems to increase especially when certain safety accidents happen. But safety is not something you can prepare for prior to a specific event, rather it should be maintained on daily basis,\u201d said instructor Lee.\u00a0The safety experience training sessions run at the Gwangnaru and Boramae centers and are free.

Brad Sherman (D-CA), was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, according to congressional records.The lawmaker introduced a similar bill in the previous House last year, saying Pyongyang meets the criteria for terror sponsor designation. That bill later passed through the Foreign Affairs Committee, but was ultimately scrapped as the House expired at the end of last year.The new legislation, whose text was not available yet, is expected to be identical to the previous one.Specifically, the bill required the president to review about 20 cases involving North Korea, including its 1987 bombing of a South Korean jetliner, and submit a report to Congress on whether they meet the requirements for terror sponsor designation or give a detailed justification as to why the cases do not meet the criteria for such a determination. (AP-Yonhap)North Korea was put on the US terrorism sponsor list for the1987 midair bombing of a Korean Airlines flight that killed all 115 people aboard.\u00a0But the US administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Calls had spiked for putting the North back on the list after Pyongyang was found to be responsible for the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. But the State Department did not do so, saying relisting would only be symbolic without significant practical consequences.The department left off the North from its latest terror sponsor list released last year, saying the regime in Pyongyang \"is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean Airlines flight in 1987.\"Calls for the North's designation have risen further in the wake of the country's two nuclear tests and a number of ballistic missile launches last year.

In the case of Germany, which again has a larger GDP vis-a-vis South Korea, its defense cost sharing burden stood at a much smaller 0.016 percent of its total economy.On the matter of total military spending, South Korea's 2016 defense white paper said that in the previous year, the country allocated 2.4 percent of its GDP to national security. This is larger than 1 percent for Japan and 1.09 percent for Germany.Per capita spending on defense stood at $681 annually in the one-year period, which is more than twice the number for Japan at $323. Seoul spends some 10 billion won annually for the KATUSA troops that can be seen as outlays to bolster up the 28,500 US troops stationed in the country.South Korean policymakers will use the sheer amount of arms the country buys from the US to further highlight it is doing its part for the alliance.Defense ministry data showed that from 2006 through October of last year, South Korea bought more than 36 trillion won worth of US-made equipment, far outpacing what it buys from other countries.It has signed up to buy the F-35A stealth fighter, as well as acquiring F-15K and KF-16 fighters, and AH-64E attack choppers. Seoul has also bought Airborne Early Warning & Control planes, Patriot missiles and various other weapons systems from its ally.\"Because Trump is a businessman, we need to provide exact figures to make clear we are doing our share,\" another military source said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He added that while US forces in the country are primarily here to defend against North Korean provocations, they serve Washington's greater strategic interests by preserving peace and stability in Northeast Asia.On the other hand, some local experts cautioned that it may not be prudent to be overly defensive about burden sharing, with the country being better served by taking a more positive and active stance on burden sharing with Washington.Park Hwee-rhak, a political science professor at Kookmin University, said that it is advisable to start talks by saying Seoul will do its utmost to do more and follow this up by outlining the conditions facing the country that need to be taken into account.\"Instead of saying we can't do more and then making concessions afterwards, it may be best to approach the matter to start on a positive note and tackle outstanding issues.\"\u00a0(Yonhap)","1270":"North Korea is expected to kick off another work-hard campaign in the spring to meet growth targets set by the government in the face of mounting international sanctions, Pyongyang watchers in Seoul said Sunday.The prediction is based on the analysis that the reclusive regime, hit by two tough sanctions for conducting two nuclear tests and firing off ballistic missiles in 2016, will likely feel it has no choice other than to exploit its people to the fullest.The country announced that its 70-day work-hard drive and the longer 200-day campaign carried out last year were \"resounding\" successes. Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)Local watchers said that with the country to be more affected by sanctions in the new year, it will do its utmost to achieve its latest five-year economic growth target that can highlight the ineffectiveness of punitive measures. Such a development could cause countries to stop pursuing sanctions and come to the negotiating table.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's address that the country must focus on economic growth goals for the 2016-2020 period. The goal was unveiled at the country's ruling Workers' Party of Korea congress held last May.Reflecting this, state controlled media outlets, such as the Rodong Sinmun, the country's biggest daily, have started releasing articles emphasizing the critical nature of striving for a strong, prosperous and civilized state as outlined by the WPK.\"If we win the struggle against our enemies that are trying to counter our form of socialism, we will be forever victorious while failure to do so will result in the country not being able to rise again,\" the newspaper claimed.Cho Bong-hyun, an analyst at the IBK Economic Research Institute, said policymakers in the North may be aware that if they don't pull off growth in 2017, the five-year plan will not be achievable.\"Under such circumstances, there is a good chance that they will carry out something like a 150-day work-drive come spring,\" he said, adding that there may be as many as two work-hard drives this year.Others said that while Pyongyang can always push its people to work harder, it may take a wait-and-see approach this year, and only launch another campaign if it realizes the set target for growth will not be met.Kim Young-hui the chief of the North Korea economic team at the Korea Development Bank, pointed out that last year work-hard drives were a tactic to build cohesion among the people and not necessarily about growth.Some Pyongyang watchers have said the recent work-hard drive was met with resentment and policymakers may be reluctant to continue to push people unless they have no choice.

But an official on the prosecutors' team said Saturday the decision will be made \"on or after tomorrow.\" Special counsel Park Young-soo enters his office on Saturday. (Yonhap)Lee allegedly gave billions of won to various organizations linked to Park's confidante, Choi Soon-sil, in return for the government's backing of a controversial merger of two Samsung affiliates in July 2015. The group has acknowledged providing funds to the organizations but denied they were a bribe.Lee was grilled by the special prosecutors for 22 hours until early Friday.The charges under consideration include bribery, perjury and, depending on the source of the funds, embezzlement and breach of trust.\u00a0Lee is accused of giving false testimony during a parliamentary hearing last month, during which he claimed to have \"never\" made donations expecting something in return.Samsung signed a 22 billion won ($18.7 million) consulting contract in August 2015 with a Germany-based firm owned by Choi and allegedly sent the company billions of won, which was used to fund her daughter's equestrian training, according to prosecutors.The group also donated 20.4 billion won to the Mir and K-Sports organizations, which are linked to Choi, becoming the biggest contributor to the foundations set up to promote Korean culture abroad and support local sports.Prosecutors claimed Samsung provided the money to Choi for exerting influence to get the National Pension Service to approve the merger a month earlier, a critical step for a smooth transfer of power to the heir apparent.\u00a0Moon Hyung-pyo, chief of the National Pension Service and former health minister, was arrested last month over his alleged role in the merger deal.Lee Kyu-chul, spokesman for the special prosecutors' team, said there were \"discrepancies in the answers required by the investigation team and the answers given by (Lee Jae-yong) on key issues.\"A source close to the probe has said Lee Jae-yong, son of the ailing Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee, told prosecutors that his company was forced by Park to support Choi's businesses. (Yonhap)","1272":"South Korea's electoral body said Friday former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is eligible to run for president regardless of his lengthy residence outside the country. The National Election Commission said under the current law, South Koreans who are 40 years and older and who have lived at least five years in the country before the date of an election can become a candidate. There has been an ongoing debate as to whether Ban meets the residence status for the next presidential election. The 72-year-old has been living outside of his native country since he became the UN helmsman in 2007, although he did visit South Korea numerous times during his tenure. Ban returned home Thursday after his second five-year term as the UN secretary-general ended at the end of last year. The country's previous law stated that candidates must have lived in South Korea continuously for five years or more. But the commission said the amended presidential elections law of 1987 deleted such a requirement.The commission said late former President Kim Dae-jung, who was chief executive of the country from 1998 to 2003, also lived abroad for a year between 1993 and December 1997, when the presidential election was held.\"He was not prevented from registering as a candidate,\" the commission said. (Yonhap)","1273":"A North Korean radio, monitored here, broadcast coded numbers Friday, in what could be a secret message to North Korean spies operating in South Korea. In the broadcast at 01:15 a.m., a state-run Radio Pyongyang announcer said, \"I'll let the members of the No. 27 expedition know of review tasks in chemistry of the distance education university from now on.\" \"No. 51 on Page 428, No. 33 on Page 192, No. 41 on Page 260...,\" the announcer read.The numbers were repeated once again, which are new compared to ones in previous broadcasts. The North has broadcast coded numbers 22 times since June 24, with the latest one made on Sunday. In the past, Pyongyang would send such broadcasts at midnight to issue orders to its secret agents hiding in the South. The communist country suspended the cipher broadcast after inter-Korean summit talks in 2000 and resumed it last year. (Yonhap)","1274":"North Korea may make surprise proposals to South Korea this year including reunions of separated families in a bid to break up the united international sanctions front, a report showed Thursday.In 2017, North Korea would seek to improve inter-Korean ties by taking advantage of political transitions in South Korea, the report by the Korea Institute for National Unification showed, referring to a possible earlier-than-expected presidential election in the South.The report said that North Korea may make proposals that Seoul cannot easily reject -- reunions of families torn by the 1950-53 Korean War or holding of high-level talks.\"By making such proposals, Pyongyang will likely demand Seoul lift its May 24 unilateral sanctions and resume operation of the now-shuttered Kaesong Industrial Complex,\" it said.From the humanitarian perspective, the issue of separated families is the most pressing one, but the North has refused to hold more reunions, claiming that South Korea is to blame for the suspension of such events.The May 24 sanctions refer to Seoul's punitive measures taken in 2010 to punish North Korea for the torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan.South Korea also shut down the factory zone in the North's border city of Kaesong in February 2016 following North Korea's nuclear and missile tests earlier last year.\"We should bear in mind that North Korea's top strategic goal is to create cracks in the global sanctions regime,\" the KINU report said.The United Nations Security Council imposed tough sanctions twice last year in response to its fourth and fifth nuclear tests and missile launches conducted by the reclusive country.The report said that North Korea will continue to advance nuclear weapons programs, focusing on strengthening its capacity to make boosted fission bombs.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's message that the country has entered the final state of preparations to test fire an intercontinental ballistic missile in the latest sign that it will not abandon its nuke and missile programs.\"It cannot be written off that North Korea will push ahead with another nuclear test to raise the level of its explosive yield to around 50 kilotons,\" it said.South Korea's defense ministry said the yield of the blast in North Korea's nuclear test in September 2016 is presumed to have been at around 10 kilotons, the largest ever conducted by country.

The UAE ambassador to Afghanistan was also injured.\u00a0\"The government strongly condemns the terrorist attacks inflicted on diplomats whose safety should be protected under international law.

(Yonhap)","1276":"Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s return home Thursday has brought him closer to his much anticipated bid for South Korean presidency, signaling a tough few months ahead for other presidential aspirants. It also means a whole new political ordeal for the 72-year-old former diplomat, who now enters domestic politics for the first time as a rookie in the electoral game.Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks to reporters before boarding a flight at the JFK International Airport (Yonhap)Ban\u2019s greatest strength is undoubtedly the public\u2019s recognition of his prestigious career as the first-ever South Korean national not only to take UN\u2019s top post, but to have served in it for two consecutive terms.Also, his overseas position has largely kept him away from the political commotion here, particularly the extensive corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye, which might result in a premature end to the incumbent administration. But the longtime absence from his home country is also a weakness for Ban who, unlike his potential rivals, has had little time to gear up for the presidential election, which is likely to take place earlier than scheduled, possibly in around April.\u00a0Who is Ban Ki-moon?Born in 1944, in Eumseong-gun in North Chungcheong Province, Ban began his career as a diplomat by passing the nation\u2019s Foreign Service Examination in 1970.He swiftly built up his career in the Foreign Ministry and consecutively filled key posts such as director of American affairs and chief of foreign policy.But he faced challenges in 2001, when he was pushed to step down from a vice ministerial post, taking responsibility for aggravated Korea-US bilateral ties.Ban then took the post of protocol secretary for Han Seung-soo, then chairman of the UN general meeting -- a transfer deemed a demotion for a former vice minister.It was the former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun who brought Ban back to domestic affairs by appointing him as presidential assistant for foreign affairs in 2003.Though he was at times criticized for his allegedly excessive pro-US stance, Ban soon gained credit in the Roh administration for his negotiating skills, which he had the chance of proving over a number of diplomatic agendas. Of them was the six-party talks which kicked off in 2003 to address North Korea\u2019s nuclear armament issue.Backed by the Roh government\u2019s full-fledged support, Ban was named the 33rd secretary-general of the United Nations in 2006, becoming the first Korean to take the post.His elite career, along with his biography titled \u201cStudy Like a Fool, Dream Like a Prodigy,\u201d has inspired South Korean youths over the years.Rising to the presidential raceThough his history largely associates him with the Roh government, Ban is known for his amicable ties with all South Korean presidents, regardless of their respective political tendencies. He is also noted as a rare high-profile civic servant who has served four separate administrations, from the military dictatorship of the Chun Doo-hwan government to the progressive Roh administration.It was such apparent neutrality, as well as his publicity, which made Ban an appealing presidential successor for President Park and her ruling conservative Saenuri Party. The plausibility of this happening expanded further, as most of the pro-Park figures lost their political momentum upon the party\u2019s crushing defeat in the parliamentary election last year.Amid speculations on Ban\u2019s likely bid for South Korea\u2019s presidency, the UN chief official met with Park during her visit to the UN headquarters in 2015.His favorable remarks over the Saemaeul Movement -- one of Park\u2019s flagship projects to develop rural areas -- and his close-door meetings with the president further boosted the rumors of his political aspirations after returning home.But with the president currently facing impeachment and the Saenuri camp divided in factional feuds, it is yet uncertain whether the diplomat will create a new political entity or join hands with existing groups.What seems to be certain is that the former UN official is determined to take on a political career upon returning home.\u201cI am ready to give my all, if only my experience and insight from my 10 years in the UN may contribute to South Korea\u2019s development,\u201d Ban told Korean media correspondents late last year, just before his tenure was to end.Also, a group of his aides recently started a headquarters in Seoul and held a press conference there, boosting expectations of Ban\u2019s imminent announcement on his presidential bid.Integrity tests lying aheadDespite the uncertainties and challenges, Ban nevertheless remains one of the top two front-runners to contend in the upcoming presidential election.For this reason, a number of political groups have increasingly been seeking to recruit him to their camp or at least to form solidarity in the election.Standing first in line is the Barun Party, which split away from Saenuri amid efforts to draw a line between the feud-ridden President Park and her loyalists.But a critical roadblock for Ban is the dispute concerning his integrity, as he is to face a public who is utterly disappointed and infuriated over the president\u2019s corruption scandal.A survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter in the second week of January showed Ban to have 20.3 percent in approval rating, down 1.2 percentage points from the previous week. Moon Jae-in, former chairman and top presidential candidate of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, took the lead with 27.9 percent.Ban\u2019s slight downtrend is attributable to the allegations, raised by a Seoul-based weekly magazine, Sisa Journal, that he received bribes worth $230,000 between 2005 and 2007.This scandal, combined with his brother and nephew\u2019s indictment in New York -- also over bribery charges -- seems to have dampened the public\u2019s enthusiasm over the returning diplomat.Another controversy for Ban is the UN resolution, which recommends retired secretary-generals to refrain from government posts in their home state for a while.Though the clause is considered non-binding, its underlying intention was enough to bring criticism on Ban for stepping into the presidential race immediately after his UN tenure.A number of opposition figures, such as Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung and South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung, have raised their voices to condemn what they see as Ban\u2019s premature presidential ambition.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1277":"South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party said Thursday it will launch its internal ethics committee this week, in line with an ongoing power struggle to purge key loyalists of President Park Geun-hye.Saenuri has been suffering from an internal feud amid the impeachment of the president, with its new interim head In Myung-jin seeking the ouster of key Park supporters to normalize the party and regain public support.

He did not elaborate on what those \"forceful ways\" could be.Kerry also said North Korea is the No. 1 challenge for the incoming administration.\"My advice to the next administration is that this is at the top.

He's unpredictable, and recklessness and unpredictability for somebody who has their hands on nuclear weapons is a very genuine threat, and particularly as they pursue intercontinental ballistic capacity, which would threaten the United States of America,\" Kerry said.Kerry said the US will never accept the North as a nuclear state.The outgoing top diplomat also said the next administration should increase pressure on the North.\"We will make it clear to the incoming administration that there are diplomatic ways of increasing the pressure, which we've been ratcheting up,\" he said.Cooperation with China is critical in resolving the North Korea problem, he said.\"China provides 100 percent of the fuel that goes to North Korea -- every airplane, every truck, every car that moves in North Korea gets its fuel from China,\" he said. \"China also is the facilitator, through Beijing, for the banking system and for whatever movement of commerce there is, of money, etc., for the North Koreans.\"\"My counsel to the next administration will be to work with China very, very closely and try to get the Chinese to, in fact, have a greater impact on the North in order to affect their behavior,\" he said.

Under the agreement that both countries described as ``final and irreversible'' at the time of its singing, Japan promised to fund a Seoul-based foundation aimed at supporting the victims.\u00a0 South Korea, in return, said it would refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a bronze statue _ representing the wartime sex slaves\u00a0-- that had been placed in front of its embassy in Seoul.\u00a0\u00a0The future of the deal was thrown into doubt earlier this month after Japan said it would recall its ambassador to South Korea and suspend economic talks in response to the placing of another such statue in South Korea's second-largest city of Busan.

We can do it with the other nuclear weapons we have, both land-based, sea-based, but maybe necessary, though, as they give the South Korean people the confidence that their nuclear deterrence is there. So therefore, in this case if negotiations completely break down, I would consider that as an alternative.\"\u00a0Perry called for resuming negotiations with the North with the goals of a deal that puts a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests by the North as well as commits the regime not to sell or transfer its nuclear technology beyond its borders.\u00a0That agreement could serve as a basis for moving toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, he said.\u00a0\"We cannot do nothing.

In 2008, the US military pulled one Apache battalion out of Korea to dispatch them to Afghanistan.Military officials expect that the helicopters will play a significant role in neutralizing North Korea\u2019s tanks and hovercraft -- crucial assets to its special warfare. They can carry 16 air-to-ground precision anti-armor Hellfire missiles, 76 70-millimeter rockets and 30-mm machine gun that can shoot some 1200 rounds.\u201cThe decision is a part of our efforts to beef up the USFK force\u2019s capability as we face escalating cross-border tension,\u201d said Kim Sung-min, Col.

(Yonhap)\"I will gradually expand the government budget for people with disabilities each year to prepare for a rise in spending,\" said Moon. The liberal presidential hopeful currently enjoys a lead over all other contenders in the May 9 election.\"I will increase government spending to create a barrier-free environment for people with disabilities,\" Moon was quoted as saying by his election camp.The presidential front-runner did not elaborate on how much government spending will increase under his administration.Ahn Cheol-soo, the presidential nominee of the center-left People's Party, also unveiled plans to improve welfare for the disabled.During a meeting with representatives of disabled people's groups, he pledged to scrap the current system that divides disabled people into six groups depending on the seriousness of their physical or mental disability. The system has been criticized for denying sufficient government support to those who need more because they are categorized into a lower than necessary group.\"I will get rid of the uniform grading system of the disabled and provide tailored services depending on their individual desires and needs,\" Ahn said.The former software mogul, who is seen as the biggest challenge to Moon, also vowed to push for legislation to prevent a recurrence of the 2014 incident in which two disabled people were rescued from a salt farm where they had been working as slaves.Ahn promised to conduct a survey of the human rights situation of disabled people every three years, announce the results, and set up centers tasked with protecting the human rights of the disabled as well as taking care of victims of abuse with disabilities.\"I'm sure there are many people who have various talents but are unable to display them simply because they have a disability,\" Ahn said. \"I am certain that we must become a society where (the disabled) are judged fairly without discrimination and with equal opportunities.\"Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party, on the other hand, was more specific, vowing to boost government spending to 1.5 percent of the country's GDP, and eventually to 2.2 percent, which he said was the OECD average now.The conservative candidate also promised more jobs and better working conditions for the disabled, noting they are currently not even protected under the law that guarantees minimum wage.He said he will work to expand the job quota for people with disabilities at each workplace to 5 percent.

(38 North)One of the possible explanations for the decreased activity may be that the \"site and associated preparations for a sixth nuclear test have transitioned to a 'stand-by' status, with personnel being allowed some down-time for recreation,\" 38 North said. \"Since the North Koreans are aware of when commercial satellites will fly overhead, the presence of personnel at play (with what looks like the normal six players on each side) may be a way of signaling that a decision has been made to place the test on hold,\" it said.Still, however, satellite imagery continues to indicate that the Punggye-ri site appears able to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time once the order is received from Pyongyang, 38 North said. (Yonhap)","1287":"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday the US is looking into the possibility of adding North Korea back to the list of states sponsors of terrorism as a way to bring pressure on the communist nation.\"We're reviewing all the status of North Korea both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as all the other ways in which we can bring pressure to bear on the regime in Pyongyang to reengage with us on a different footing than the past talks have been held. So yes, we're evaluating all of those options,\" Tillerson told reporters.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (AP-Yonhap)It was the first time a senior US official has mentioned the possibility of relisting the North as a terrorism sponsor. That underlines the commitment by the administration of President Donald Trump to using all possible means to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang to move toward denuclearization.North Korea was put on the list for its 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Airlines flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the US administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Calls for adding Pyongyang back to the State Department's list of terrorism-sponsoring nations have gained significant traction in the wake of the Feb. 13 killing in Malaysia of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.All evidence shows that the North was behind the slaying, though the regime denies any involvement.Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation calling for relisting North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.The North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act (H.R.479), which was introduced by Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) in January, requires the State Department to submit a report within 90 days after the bill's enactment on whether Pyongyang meets the criteria for a terror sponsor.

Two conservative candidates set an aggressive tone from the outset, accusing him of kowtowing to North Korea and flip-flopping on missile defense.Presidential candidates hold hands before their second TV debate, hosted by KBS, on April 19, 2017. From left are Sim Sang-jeung, Hong Joon-pyo, Yoo Seong-min, Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo. (Yonhap)Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party revisited the allegation that the former presidential chief of staff consulted Pyongyang before the government abstained in a vote on UN resolution on North Korea's human rights violations in 2007, an accusation that Moon denied again.Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party denounced Moon for lying, citing a former foreign minister's memoirs that first sparked the controversy. Moon countered that Hong was amplifying an unverified claim. The two-hour late night debate was hosted by public broadcaster KBS. National security has emerged a key campaign theme for the May 9 presidential election amid growing regional tensions caused by Pyongyang's saber-rattling and Washington's show of force.Conservatives, striving to revive their sagging campaign, focused on security issues, including the deployment of the US THAAD missile shield in South Korea, which has met with angry protests and economic retaliation from China. As the session began, Moon raised the need for Seoul \"to make it clear to China that in the event the North carries out a nuclear test, the deployment of THAAD is inevitable.\" Yoo criticized Moon for inconsistency, saying he initially opposed the missile defense and then pledged to deploy it if the North conducts its sixth nuclear test. Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party taunted Moon's \"strategic ambiguity\" stance as fitting a commentator, not a political leader. Moon dodged the blows from the minor candidates, each below 10 percent in approval ratings, and focused his offensive on closest rival Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party. The election is shaping up as a two-way race as Moon maintains a slight lead over Ahn, most recently by 40 percent to 37 percent in approval ratings.Moon has called for the decision on THAAD to be left to the next administration, while Ahn is a rare political liberal officially backing the deployment. Moon accused Ahn of limiting Seoul's options in negotiations with Washington and Beijing by taking a fixed position. Ahn's stance is out of sync with his party's official line, Moon said.Ahn defended his position by criticizing the incumbent government for bypassing crucial consultation with China before agreeing with the United States on the deployment.All the contenders agreed that the South Korea-US alliance and China's political and economic leverage on North Korea are key to stopping the unruly regime from conducting a new nuclear test.At the start of debate, the five candidates were asked what diplomatic leverage the South Korean government has to block the North's provocation. Moon said the government's first task is to discuss the issue with Washington.\"First, there's a need to closely talk and coordinate with our ally the United States, and in the process, say what we have to say to have our position clearly reflected,\" he said. Hong said China's role will be important to prevent an \"extreme\" confrontation between North Korea and the US.\"If China can deter North Korea's provocations, I don't think the US will carry out a pre-emptive strike (against Pyongyang),\" he said.Ahn ruled out any form of war on the peninsula.\"It's important to make the US aware that we must be the main players and decide the fate of the Republic of Korea,\" he said. \"With China, we must step up diplomatic efforts to lead it to actively take part in sanctions against North Korea.\"Ahn said China's lukewarm stance was a key reason behind North Korea's continued provocations.Yoo called for joining hands with the US to persuade China to tighten sanctions against Pyongyang by banning coal imports from the country and cutting supplies of crude oil.He also left open the possibility of a pre-emptive strike, saying it is a self-defensive measure to be used when a North Korean nuclear attack appears imminent.Sim stressed the importance of managing the situation together with allies and the international community to ensure that the North's strategic provocations don't spiral into a crisis.She also argued the government should actively play a mediator role to lead China and the US to reaffirm the principle of guaranteeing peace on the peninsula.\"Based on this, I will offer a carrot and stick to draw (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-un to the (negotiating) table aimed at freezing North Korea's nuclear weapons program and denuclearization.\" (Yonhap)","1289":"Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea, the front-runner in the presidential race, came under heavy fire from his rivals during a live televised debate Wednesday.While conservative candidate attacked Moon over his alleged contact with North Korea about a restrictive United Nations resolution, a progressive contender accused him of being ambiguous about the deployment of a controversial US antimissile battery.\u00a0Citizens gathered at Seoul Station watch the presidential candidates' live television debate on Wednesday.

(AP-Yonhap)North Korean ballistic missile tests are banned by the United Nations because they\u2019re seen as part of the North\u2019s push for a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the US mainland. The latest test came as US officials pivoted from a hard line to diplomacy at the UN in an effort to address what may be Washington\u2019s most pressing foreign policy challenge.North Korea didn\u2019t immediately comment on the launch, though its state media on Saturday reiterated the country\u2019s goal of being able to strike the continental USThe timing of the North\u2019s test was striking: Only hours earlier the UN Security Council held a ministerial meeting on Pyongyang\u2019s escalating weapons program. North Korean officials boycotted the meeting, which was chaired by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile flew for several minutes and reached a maximum height of 71 kilometers (44 miles) before it apparently failed.It didn\u2019t immediately provide an estimate on how far the missile flew, but a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said it was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. It broke up a few minutes after the launch.Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, speaking after a meeting of Japan\u2019s National Security Council, said the missile is believed to have traveled about 50 kilometers (30 miles) and fallen on an inland part of North Korea.Analysts say the KN-17 is a new Scud-type missile developed by North Korea. The North fired the same type of missile April 16, just a day after a massive military parade where it showed off its expanding missile arsenal, but US officials called that launch a failure.Some analysts say a missile the North test fired April 5, which US officials identified as a Scud variant, also might have been a KN-17. US officials said that missile spun out of control and crashed into the sea.Moon Seong Mook, a South Korean analyst and former military official, says that the North would gain valuable knowledge even from failed launches as it continues to improve its technologies for missiles. The South Korean and Japanese assessments about Saturday\u2019s launch indicate that the North fired the missile from a higher-than-normal angle to prevent it from flying too far, he said.\u201cThey could be testing a variety of things, such as the thrust of the rocket engine or the separation of stages,\u201d Moon said. \u201cA failure is a failure, but that doesn\u2019t mean the launch was meaningless.\u201dThe two earlier launches were conducted from an eastern coastal area, but Saturday\u2019s missile was fired in the west, from an area near Pukchang, just north of the capital, Pyongyang.South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the launch as an \u201cobvious\u201d violation of United Nations resolutions and the latest display of North Korea\u2019s \u201cbelligerence and recklessness.\u201d\u201cWe sternly warn that the North Korean government will continue to face a variety of strong punitive measures issued by the UN Security Council and others if it continues to reject denuclearization and play with fire in front of the world,\u201d the ministry said.Pope Francis warned that \u201ca good part of humanity\u201d will be destroyed if tensions with North Korea escalate, and he called for diplomacy and a revived United Nations to take the lead in negotiating a resolution. Francis was asked as he traveled back to Rome from Egypt on Saturday local time (early Sunday morning Seoul time) about North Korean ballistic missile tests and US warnings of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences if the world fails to stop them. \u201cToday, a wider war will destroy not a small part of humanity, but a good part of humanity and culture. Everything. Everything, no? It would be terrible. I don\u2019t think humanity today could bear it,\u201d he told reportersThe North routinely test-fires a variety of ballistic missiles, despite UN prohibitions, as part of its weapons development. While shorter-range missiles are somewhat routine, there is strong outside worry about each longer-range North Korean ballistic test.Saturday\u2019s launch comes at a point of particularly high tension. Trump has sent a nuclear-powered submarine and the USS Carl Vinson aircraft supercarrier to Korean waters, and North Korea this week conducted large-scale, live-fire exercises on its eastern coast. The US and South Korea also started installing a missile defense system that is supposed to be partially operational within days, while their two navies began joint military drills later Saturday.The South Korean navy said the drills are aimed at \u201cdeterring North Korea\u2019s provocations and displaying the firm alliance between the United States and South Korea.\u201dOn Friday, the United States and China offered starkly different strategies for addressing North Korea\u2019s escalating nuclear threat as Tillerson demanded full enforcement of economic sanctions on Pyongyang and urged new penalties. Stepping back from suggestions of US military action, he even offered aid to North Korea if it ends its nuclear weapons program.The range of Tillerson\u2019s suggestions, which over a span of 24 hours also included restarting negotiations, reflected America\u2019s failure to halt North Korea\u2019s nuclear advances despite decades of US-led sanctions, military threats and stop-and-go rounds of diplomatic engagement. As the North approaches the capability to hit the US mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, the Trump administration feels it is running out of time.Chairing a ministerial meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday, Tillerson declared that \u201cfailing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences.\u201dHis ideas included a ban on North Korean coal imports and preventing its overseas guest laborers, a critical source of government revenue, from sending money home. And he warned of unilateral US moves against international firms conducting banned business with Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, which could ensnare banks in China, the North\u2019s primary trade partner.Yet illustrating the international gulf over how best to tackle North Korea, several foreign ministers on the 15-member council expressed fears of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula, which was divided between the American-backed South and communist North even before the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended with no formal peace treaty. And while danger always has lurked, tensions have escalated dramatically as the North\u2019s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has expanded a nuclear arsenal his government says is needed to avert a US invasion.No voice at Friday\u2019s session was more important than that of China, a conduit for 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s commerce and a country Trump is pinning hopes on for a peaceful resolution to the nuclear crisis. Trump, who recently hosted President Xi Jinping for a Florida summit, has sometimes praised the Chinese leader for a newfound cooperation to crack down on North Korea and sometimes threatened a go-it-alone US approach if Xi fails to deliver.Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China would adhere to past UN resolutions and wants a denuclearized peninsula. But he spelled out no further punitive steps his government might consider, despite Tillerson\u2019s assertions in an interview hours ahead of the council meeting that Beijing would impose sanctions of its own if North Korea conducts another nuclear test.Wang put forward a familiar Chinese idea to ease tensions: North Korea suspending its nuclear and missile activities if the US and South Korea stop military exercises in the region. Washington and Seoul reject the idea.Tillerson said the US does not seek regime change in North Korea, and he signaled American openness to holding direct negotiations with Pyongyang. The US also could resume aid to North Korea once it \u201cbegins to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missile technology programs,\u201d he said. Since 1995, he added, Washington has provided more than $1.3 billion to the impoverished country.But the prospects for any more US money going there appeared bleak. Even negotiations don\u2019t seem likely.Tillerson said the North must take \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to reduce its weapons threat before talks could occur. Six-nation nuclear negotiations with North Korea stalled in 2009. The Obama administration sought to resurrect them in 2012, but a deal to provide food aid in exchange for a nuclear freeze soon collapsed.\u201cIn a nutshell, (North Korea) has already declared not to attend any type of talks which would discuss its nuclear abandonment, nuclear disbandment, Kim In-ryong, North Korea\u2019s deputy UN ambassador, told The Associated Press. His government declined to attend Friday\u2019s council meeting.

The candidates cannot be aided with any reference materials, but paper will be provided for note taking.\u00a0 The five major presidential candidates Tuesday campaign nationwide, appealing to the voters for support. From left are Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, Ahn Cheol-soo of the centrist People\u2019s Party, Yoo Seong-min of the conservative Bareun Party and Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party. (Yonhap)As with the previous debate, the participants will be Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea, Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party, Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party, Yoo Seong-min of the Bareun Party and Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party. Wednesday\u2019s debate is expected to allow the candidates to make their case and provide more detailed accounts of their views and policy proposals. In the first debate last week, Reps. Yoo and Sim -- the two least popular candidates -- were considered to have stood out, with their focused delivery of their policy visions. The debate will be divided into two sessions, with the first dealing with foreign affairs and national security. The second segment will deal with education, social issues and culture.After the KBS debate, the contenders face four more debates, with three organized by the National Election Commission.

At a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, Pence said since the two countries\u2019 trade agreement took effect five years ago, the US\u2019 deficit has more than doubled, calling it the \u201cmost concerning fact.\u201dUS Vice President Mike Pence (Yonhap)\u201cWe have to be honest about where our trade relationship is falling short,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hard truth. And our businesses continue to face too many barriers to entry which tilts the playing field against the American workers and American growth.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the South Korea-US free trade agreement as a \u201cjob killer\u201d especially for the US auto industry, and immediately already pulled out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership after taking office. But Pence\u2019s remarks represent the most explicit signal yet the administration will push for a renegotiation of the bilateral deal.\u00a0 According to the US Census Bureau, the country\u2019s trade deficit in goods with South Korea rose from $16.6 billion in 2012 to $27.7 billion in 2016.South Korea\u2019s surplus with the US, meanwhile, soared from $15.2 billion to $23.2 billion during the same period, Korea International Trade Association data shows. South Korea argues automobiles are a small fraction of two-way trade, and has been seeking to import more energy from the US while encouraging its companies to invest more there. Last month, Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Joo Hyung-hwan visited Washington and met with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a bid to highlight the pact\u2019s mutual benefits. Pence called for help to \u201clevel that playing field,\u201d and build a system that \u201cmaximizes jobs and growth\u201d for both countries. \u201cWe are reviewing all of our trade agreements across the world to ensure they benefit our economy as much as they benefit our trading partners,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cWe will work toward that end to reform KORUS in the days ahead.\u201dWrapping up the lecture attended by some 70 South Korean and US business leaders, Pence left through Osan Air Base for Tokyo, where he met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and discussed North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear and missile threats. Pence also took part in an economic dialogue with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.On Monday, Pence sent a robust warning to Pyongyang during a joint news conference with acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. He is also scheduled to visit Indonesia and Australia later on before heading to Hawaii, home to the US Pacific Command.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1299":"Presidential candidate Sim Sang-jeung of the minor progressive Justice Party pledged Tuesday to drastically reduce working hours if elected in the upcoming vote.The former labor activist unveiled a two-stage plan to shorten the legal regular weekly work hours from the current 40 to 35 by 2025. Sim Sang-jeung, the presidential candidate of the far-left Justice Party, waves to citizens on her campaign trail in Incheon, west of Seoul, on April 18, 2017. (Yonhap)\"In order to escape from our overworked society and enter the era of the fourth industrial revolution where people are respected, we must reduce working hours,\" she said during a press conference at the National Assembly. The current law limits regular working hours to 40 per week and restricts overtime work to 12 hours. But the government actually permits up to 68 hours by excluding weekend work from overtime regulations. Sim said in the first phase she would strictly enforce the 40-hour rule and abolish the enforcement guideline that allows for extended overtime.\"What allowed long working hours to persist was the labor ministry's interpretation (of the law) that excluded weekends from extended hours,\" she said.In the second stage, Sim said she would introduce a system to allow employees to leave work at 5 p.m. starting in 2022 and establish a 35-hour working week by 2025.The reduced work week will be a \"realization of economic justice\" and a \"revolution in jobs,\" she claimed.The candidate also promised to set up a special presidential committee to oversee the task of shortening working hours.\"There is no time to lose on establishing justice in working hours and removing the deep-rooted evils of long working hours,\" she said.Sim's approval rating has hovered below 5 percent ahead of the May 9 election.

This process is expected to take about three weeks.For a detailed search underwater, the operation team installed earlier this year 40 40-by-20-meter fences around a 32,000-square-meter area on the seabed where Sewol sank. Underwater fences surrounding the area have been set up to prevent any items from being lost.Officials said the divers have searched seven of the 40 zones, but have not retrieved any remains or personal belongings.

(Yonhap)\"I think when we talked about the use of red lines in the past with respect to Syria -- the president's red line -- that drawing red lines hasn't really worked in the past,\" he said. \"He holds his cards close to the vest, and you're not going to see him telegraphing how he's going to respond. ... I don't think that you're going to see the president drawing red lines in the sand, but I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that, when appropriate, this president will take decisive action,\" he added. It was in response to a question whether the president has a \"red line,\" a tipping point that could prompt military action when it is crossed.He referred to the US bombing of a Syrian air base on April 7 to punish the Bashar al-Assad regime for a suspected use of chemical weapons.The spokesman also said that President Trump had a \"really good\" meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in Florida, adding that the results are now \"paying off.\" He still emphasized the need for the stepped-up cooperation from China and urged it to exert more influence in the region. \"I think you see China playing a much more active role with respect to North Korea both politically and economically, that they can continue to apply pressure to achieve results,\" he said. \"And I think we're going to continue to urge China to exhibit its influence in the region to get better results.\" (Yonhap)","1303":"WASHINGTON -- A US State Department official said Monday there is no hiccup in the ongoing deployment of a cutting-edge missile defense system in South Korea, dismissing concern about a political setback.\"There hasn't been any change, and there hasn't certainly been anything about the decision-making process that would indicate any change,\" Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told reporters in a telephone conference. \"So we're on track as far as that goes for THAAD deployment.\"THAAD is the acronym for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.It's the most advanced US missile shield composed of a state-of-the-art radar and interceptors to hit incoming missiles.(Yonhap)The allies agreed last year to install a THAAD system in the southeastern town of Seongju, saying it's a must to thwart North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. Some related components are already here.There has been speculation that the US may delay the deployment process until after South Korea's presidential elections on May 9.South Koreans are split over the THAAD issue amid a strong backlash, especially from China.\u00a0 Some diplomatic observers in Seoul said US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping might have discussed the so-called big deal bilaterally. The US might have made some concessions over THAAD in a bid to draw cooperation in efforts to put \"maximum pressure\" on Pyongyang, they pointed out.South Korea's foreign ministry, however, reaffirmed that there is no daylight between Seoul and Washington on the issue.\"South Korea and the US have a completely common position with regard to the THAAD deployment,\" the ministry's spokesman Cho June-hyuck said. He added they agree on the need for reinforcing their joint defense posture via the early installation and operation of the missile defense system.On Monday, South Korea's defense ministry also reaffirmed that there is no change in the plan to position a THAAD unit in South Korea as early as possible. The ministry has already secured a golf course in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, from Lotte Group in a land-swap agreement.Seoul and Washington are in the final phase of talks on the grant of the site under the Status of Forces Agreement, officials said.The two sides will then carry out a joint environmental impact survey of the zone, a process likely to take weeks or months.\"It's virtually impossible to wrap up the deployment of the THAAD system before the presidential election,\" a defense official said.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Thornton warned Pyongyang not to test the Donald Trump administration's resolve.If it presses ahead with another nuclear test, it \"would draw a pretty significant international response,\" she said without elaborating.She left the door open for negotiations with the communist nation.\"We are definitely not seeking conflict or regime change,\" she said. \"But we are committed to defending our people and our allies should it be necessary.\"North Korea stated that it won't budge at all.\"We'll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis,\" Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol said in an interview with the BBC, a British broadcaster.\"If the US is reckless enough to use military means, it would mean from that very day, an all-out war.\" (Yonhap)","1304":"The unusual presidential campaign poster of Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party is getting mixed responses among Twitter users.\n\r\nCampaigning for the presidential election officially began Monday with the release of candidate campaign posters. \n\r\nAhn\u2019s poster, which was reportedly counselled by an awards-winning advertisement designer Lee Je-suk, soon caught the public\u2019s attention as it had a rather groundbreaking design for a presidential campaign poster.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ahn Cheol-soo camp)\n\n\n\r\nUnlike other candidates\u2019 posters where the candidate\u2019s face fills most of the space, Ahn\u2019s poster featured the upper half of his body with his arms stretched out. \n\r\nTwitter user @Raoulian suggested that if put together with other posters, Ahn\u2019s poster stands out and \u201cit looks as if Ahn\u2019s opening up the sliding door.\u201d \n\n \r\n(Official blog of Ahn Cheol-soo)\n\r\nHowever, Twitter user @fakemommy suggested that campaign posters should focus on serving its purpose. \n\r\n\u201cIf visual differentiation influences the result of the election, the posters should be top-notch avant-garde.

Though there was deviation among research firms, most public surveys released Sunday and Monday indicated that though centrist Ahn had been catching up with Moon over the past few weeks, Moon was still in the lead.Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea (Yonhap)Realmeter results released Monday put Moon, the candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, at 44.8 percent in support ratings, 13.5 percentage points higher than the 31.3 percent held by Ahn of the People\u2019s Party.By province, Moon beat out Ahn in most regions, including Seoul, Incheon-Gyeonggi Province, Daejeon and the Chungcheong province and Busan-South Gyeongsang Province. Ahn led Moon only in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. They were closely competing in Gwangju and the Jeolla province, with Moon up 47.2 percent to 44.8 percent, within the margin of error, showed Realmeter. The voter sentiment unveiled by Hankook Research on the previous day was similar, showing the gap between the two was 7 percentage points. Moon and Ahn marked 42.6 percent and 35.6 percent, respectively, nationwide.Some political watchers attribute Ahn\u2019s faltering to the inadequate apology over his wife\u2019s alleged misconduct and to disappointment toward him in the first TV debate among many viewers.Ahn\u2019s wife Kim Mi-kyung is suspected of having instructed Ahn\u2019s political aide to take care of nonpolitical matters for her, allegedly in a coercive manner. Though Ahn said his \u201cwife has apologized (to the former aide),\u201d watchers said his remarks sounded far from sincere.

Below is the fifth and final installment on Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party. \u2013 Ed.\u00a0Rep. Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party (Yonhap)In South Korea\u2019s crowded field of presidential candidates, Rep. Sim Sang-jeung stands out in more ways than one.She is the only woman -- a fiercely independent one unlike the \u201cprincess\u201d Park Geun-hye whom voters last elected to be their president. A fighter to the core, the former labor activist does not shy away from sensitive issues such as gay rights and abortion, but at the same time has a surprisingly soft and likable image.Sim is also the only candidate from a major political party who does not hail from South or North Gyeongsang provinces. She was born in Paju, just north of Seoul, in 1959. StrengthsSim\u2019s stance on key state policies has been quite consistent throughout her political career compared to other presidential hopefuls: they are the farthest to the left side of the political spectrum.She led the campaign to oppose the South Korea-US Free Trade Agreement a decade ago, which is her key differentiating point from the candidate of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, Moon Jae-in.Sim\u2019s consistency and unwavering commitment to progressive values is the reason why she has some of the most steadfast and faithful supporters who put the three-term lawmaker among the top recipients of political donations.\u00a0WeaknessesFor Sim, the biggest challenge comes from the traditional rivalry between liberals and conservatives, which even divided the country geographically into the liberal Jeolla and the conservative Gyeongsang provinces.Amid the two\u2019s vested rights and electoral battles over the past decades, far-left candidates have often been pressured to resign for the sake of a victory for the liberals or form a united front against the conservatives.It is also estimated that a sizable number of progressive supporters choose liberal candidates at polls in order to prevent their ballots from being \u201cwasted.\u201dAccording to opinion polls, Sim\u2019s support rating stands below 4 percent, lower than that of her party, which hovers at around 6 percent.OpportunitiesIn two previous presidential elections, progressive candidates quit midway, trapped in the \u201cprogressive-liberal shared destiny\u201d mindset.Knowing this, Sim has declared a race to the finish line, no matter what.Sim\u2019s camp is aiming for a double-digit score in voter support, pinning hopes on TV debates. Camp officials say the candidate has already shown off her resolute manner and policy credentials in the first round of the televised session Thursday.Though few see a real chance of Sim winning the May 9 presidential election, she could woo new supporters and boost the political weight of herself and her party in the post-election political landscape, analysts say.ThreatsMoney matters. Any candidate and his or her affiliated political party could be saddled with heavy debt as the National Election Commission only fully compensates campaign costs for those with ballots of at least 15 percent.Furthermore, those failing to grab 10 percent of votes will have to bear the full campaign cost, as not a single won will be recouped via the state fund.If Sim drops her bid midway again, she could face heavy criticism from her core supporters who, despite the concern of \u201cwasted votes,\u201d were willing to stick with her. There is a possibility that Sim will come under pressure to resign and endorse Moon Jae-in from the liberal Democratic Party to beat Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","1307":"Around 1,000 US airmen and fighter jets have teamed up with South Korea's Air Force in a joint combat training to ensure their readiness against North Korea's provocations, the Pacific Command announced Monday.The two-week Max Thunder exercise, one of the largest military flying exercises held annually in South Korea, is scheduled to run though April 28 at Kunsan Air Base in the southwest of the peninsula.South Korean and US fighter jets fly together in the 2016 Max Thunder exercise in this file photo provided by the South Korean Air Force.

(Yonhap)","1310":"South Korea's election authorities began taking official registrations Saturday from those seeking to become the country's chief executive in the upcoming election, as two front-runners submitted their paperwork.After the two-day registration, the official campaign period for the May 9 presidential election will begin Monday, according to the National Election Commission.A total of 26 potential candidates had registered with the NEC after preliminary registrations began on March 10, when former President Park Geun-hye was forced out of office by a Constitutional Court ruling, prompting the rare presidential by-election.As of Friday, 21 remained on the list after the rest withdrew their preliminary, mostly self-imposed candidacies, according to the NEC.How many will still run after the registration period remained to be seen, but a number of preliminary candidates are expected to drop out as the official registration will cost each 300 million won ($264,500) in trust funds, while the pre-registration cost nothing.The money is refundable only if the candidate wins more than 15 percent of all eligible votes cast, according to the NEC.Currently, only two presidential hopefuls are seen able to garner as much support. They are Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea and Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party.Both enjoyed an approval rating of over 30 percent each in most recent polls on the upcoming election.In a statement, Moon said \"a new history has begun\" in South Korea.\"The new Korea is a country for everyone,\" he said. \"It's time for us to bring our hearts together. And to build a new Korea, I will embrace everyone.\"Ahn, who has been making grounds on Moon of late, said he will try to \"win the election for the people.\"\"At this presidential election, we'll be voting for the future of the country,\" he said. \"We can choose to return to the past, or to open up a new future.\"The election is expected to involve at least three others from the same number of political parties that currently hold parliamentary seats.Hong Joon-pyo of the former ruling Liberty Korea Party, who currently maintains a distant third with an approval rating of less than 10 percent, officially joined Moon and Ahn in the race Saturday, while Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party and Rep. Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party are also expected to soon follow suit. (Yonhap)","1311":"A sliver of hope may be in store for Bareun Party presidential candidate Rep. Yoo Seong-min, following the first televised debate in this year\u2019s presidential election. Conservative contender Yoo, along with Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party, is considered to have stood out by maintaining focus on his policy vision and clearly delivering his views. While the two front-runners -- Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea and Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party -- spent much of the time arguing with each other and conservative rival Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party, Yoo was left relatively free to convey his views. Hong, in contrast, was noted more for his unrestrained attacks against his rivals. Hong referred to Moon as the \u201cmain enemy,\u201d a term also used by the military to refer to North Korea, when grilled by Yoo. Hong also shifted the focus to past actions of administrations linked to Moon, and Ahn\u2019s People\u2019s Party.The main contenders in South Korea's presidential election (from L to R): Hong Joon-pyo, Ahn Cheol-soo, Yoo Seong-min, Sim Sang-jeung and Moon Jae-in. (Yonhap)Opinion polls conducted before the Thursday debate placed Yoo last among party-backed candidates, alongside Sim. Yoo\u2019s party was also soundly defeated by the Liberty Korea Party in Wednesday\u2019s by-elections, which prompted the latter to claim the conservatives were banding behind it. However, as predicted by some, Yoo\u2019s standout performance during the debate has raised hopes for the minor conservative candidate. His party assessed the debate as having provided Yoo with the opportunity to show \u201cthe magnitude of his capabilities and his political convictions.\u201dIn addition to possibly drawing voters away from Hong, some have speculated it remains possible for him to attract votes from Ahn. Ahn\u2019s support rating rose quickly after he was confirmed as his party\u2019s candidate, putting him in a neck-and-neck race with Moon. However, pundits say that much of the support Ahn has gathered is likely to be from voters who consider him the only viable alternative to Moon.Ahn, who began his career in mainstream politics in the Democratic Party, has been taking on an increasingly conservative tint in his economic and national security policies. Since his party\u2019s primaries began, Ahn has emphasized the private sector\u2019s role in the economy, and that he considers the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system necessary. Political watchers predict that opinion polls, to be released in the weekend, will be the barometer for voter sentiment in the Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province region, which is a political home turf for conservatives.In addition, the first round of the TV debates could impact support in the wealthy Seocho and Gangnam districts of southern Seoul, which typically votes for conservative candidates.

Pyongyang, meanwhile, recently launched a ballistic missile and some experts say it could conduct another nuclear test at virtually anytime.\u00a0Many North Korea watchers believe North Korea could have a viable nuclear warhead and a ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland on Trump's watch as president -- within the next few years. \u00a0Han, however, said North Korea blames Trump and the US for the rising tensions. He cited not only the US-South Korean wargames and the deployment of the aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, but a tweet Trump posted Tuesday in which he said the North is \u201clooking for trouble.'' Trump also tweeted that if China doesn't do its part to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the US can handle it.\u201cTrump is always making provocations with his aggressive words,'' Han said. \u201cSo that's why. It's not the DPRK but the US and Trump that makes trouble.''\u00a0The annual military exercises have consistently infuriated the North, which views them as rehearsals for an invasion. Washington and Seoul deny that, but reports that exercises have included \u201cdecapitation strikes'' aimed at the North's leadership have fanned Pyongyang's anger.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOur stance toward their hostile policy is strident and clear-cut,'' Han said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is thinking about several options as regards the DPRK. Those options include such reckless options as headquarter decapitation and the pre-emptive strike.\u00a0\u201cWhatever comes from the US, we will cope with it. We are fully prepared to handle it.''\u00a0Outwardly, there are few signs of concern in North Korea despite the political back and forth. Instead, the country is gearing up for its biggest holiday of the year, the 105th anniversary of the birth of the late Kim Il Sung, the country's founder and leader Kim Jong Un's grandfather. \u00a0The Saturday anniversary may provide the world with a look at some of that arsenal. Expectations are high the North may put its newest missiles on display during a military parade that could be held to mark the event.","1313":"Conservative presidential candidate Yoo Seong-min plans to focus on expanding welfare to tackle the troubles of low birth rates and an aging population if elected in the upcoming vote, a list of his top 10 campaign pledges showed Friday.The nominee of the splinter conservative Bareun Party made the pledge as part of his vision to build a nation where people want to have children and receive fair treatment for their labor.Yoo Seong-min, presidential nominee of Bareun Party. (Yonhap)The list obtained from the national election watchdog showed that the four-term lawmaker's top three pledges center on reforms for labor, women and welfare.He promised to enact a law under which mothers can take maternity leave for up to three years and employees can leave work on time. He also pledged to double child care allowances, build more public child care centers, reduce the number of irregular workers, and raise the minimum wage.Other welfare plans included scrapping a regulation that denies state subsidies to those who live below the poverty line but have income-earning family members to depend on.Yoo is famous for accusing former President Park Geun-hye of backtracking on her welfare pledges after she took office in 2013.While Park branded him a traitor, many others regarded him highly for speaking his mind to his former boss. Yoo previously served as Park's chief aide.In other areas, the former economist pledged to create an environment in which young people are encouraged to launch their own businesses and thus create more jobs.He said he would introduce legislation to sever abusive ties between large and small businesses and overhaul practices that privilege family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol.Speaking to a group of businessmen later in the day, the candidate promised to upgrade the Small and Medium Business Administration to a new ministry handling startups, as well as small and medium-sized firms.\"We cannot implement policies for small and medium-sized businesses with just the SMBA, which belongs to the trade ministry whose policies revolve around large businesses,\" he said. \"I will create (the new ministry) that will be tasked with properly pursuing policies for small and medium-sized firms and startups, and if I become president, I will meet frequently with representatives of smaller enterprises rather than leaders of large corporations.\"On national security, he called for building a stronger military and establishing a multi-layer defense system against North Korea's nuclear threats. By increasing defense spending from last year's 2.4 percent of gross domestic product to 3.5 percent, he proposed reintroducing tactical nuclear weapons and deploying additional batteries of the controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system.Other pledges involved reforms in education and politics, including holding a referendum next year on a constitutional revision centered on changing the single five-year presidential term to a renewable four-year term.Yoo's approval rating has remained in the single digits ahead of the May 9 election.

Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence officials believe this form of sending orders to be outdated. Many have said the broadcast may be some sort of deception strategy aimed at sparking confusion within South Korea.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000, when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.

He also vowed to issue a statement directly addressing the North.Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party also said that he would work on preventing a preventive strike through talks with Washington and Beijing, but added that he would prepare for battle, if the US went ahead.Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Bareun Party underlined the importance of remaining in close partnership with the US, while minority progressive Justice Party\u2019s Sim Sang-jeung said that she would first deliver a presidential address and then talk to US and Chinese leaders.But as for the deployment of THAAD, which has been suggested as a countermeasure to the North\u2019s provocations, there were differences among candidates -- especially between Moon and Yoo.\u201cMy suggestion is to remain open to both possibilities (of deploying or withdrawing THAAD) and pass the issue on to the next government,\u201d Moon said.Moon had previously opposed the US anti-missile system, but recently altered his policy line to accepting it if North Korea continues nuclear provocations.He also criticized Yoo for his pro-THAAD stance, pointing out that the deployment, requiring massive public finances, would first need to be ratified by legislature.Yoo, on the other hand, raised doubts on Moon\u2019s shift in stance.\u201cIt sounds like (Moon) was against THAAD up to the North\u2019s fifth nuclear test last year, but will accept it upon a sixth test,\u201d he said, arguing that Moon was only seeking votes ahead of the election.Far-leftist Sim was the uncompromising opponent of the missile defense system. \u201cI seem to be the only one among the five candidates to oppose THAAD,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should not let THAAD lead to an economic crisis or create a power game on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dAhn, who was accused of flip-flopping over the issue, claimed that he had to adjust to the recent diplomatic and economic situations.\u201cA state leader should make the best response possible for the sake of national interest according to the changing situation,\u201d he said.Referring to China\u2019s economic retaliation and North Korea\u2019s provocations, Ahn called for an active, reinforced national security system.The five presidential hopefuls are to officially register themselves as candidates this weekend, after which a 22-day campaign period will kick off until a day before the May 9 election.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1323":"SEJONG -- South Korean rice will be sent to Southeast Asian developing countries through an international food aid program for the first time in history, the agriculture ministry said Thursday.According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, a panel of the ASEAN+3 Emergency Rice Reserve approved South Korea's plan earlier this week to offer 750 tons of rice to the food aid program.(Yonhap)Launched in 2013 by 10 countries of the ASEAN, South Korea, Japan and China, APTERR is aimed at safeguarding the region's food security in case of emergencies, such as floods and droughts.Out of the 750 tons of South Korean rice, 500 tons will go to Myanmar and 250 tons to Cambodia through APTERR's food aid program around next month.The ministry said that it is the first time that the government-run rice stockpiles are donated to a third country through an international framework.South Korea is the only country in the world to have become a donor country after being a recipient of UN aid in half a century. This transformation has inspired many developing nations to follow in the country's footsteps to advance their respective economies.The APTERR participation is also part of the Seoul government's plan to deal with a chronic oversupply of rice in the country stemming from a sharp drop in rice consumption. Some 300,000 tons of rice remained in excess last year, as the 4.2 million ton supply outnumbers the 3.9 million tons consumed, and the glut will likely stay at 200,000 tons in 2017. (Yonhap)","1324":"South Korea's tourism sector, which has been hit hard by a dearth of Chinese visitors after Beijing banned its travel agencies from offering travel packages to the neighboring country, is moving quickly to reshape itself to move forward, industry watchers said Thursday.Nearly a month into the ban, local tourism and hospitality businesses that had overly relied on Chinese visitors are scrambling to reassess developments and reprioritize their long-term strategies. The shift necessitated by the change includes looking to attract more visitors from other nations and promote more in-country travel, sources said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The sudden drop in inbound Chinese tourists is the result of a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing over the planned deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on South Korean soil. Chinese nationals accounted for nearly half of inbound foreigners in 2016, with their individual spending estimated at about $2,080 per person, according to the Korea Tourism Organization. Besides tourism, many local companies and goods have been hit hard by China's open objections to the missile defense system.China has slammed THAAD for hurting its security interests, despite repeated assurances by South Korea that the weapons system is to counter North Korea's evolving nuclear and long-range missile threats.In the wake of the dispute, local tourist-oriented businesses and governments reported sharp drops in earnings. The southern port city of Busan said it has received cancellations from some 94 Chinese cruises that were slated to use its port since March 15, when the trip ban came into effect. The total number of cruise passengers visiting South Korea's No. 2 city could have been as many as 300,000, according to the Busan Port Authority.Incheon, a port city located west of Seoul, has had about 87 percent of Chinese cruises call off their scheduled arrivals, while car ferries -- that carry passengers and cargo, and ply between the two countries -- have virtually been getting zero passenger traffic, local authorities claimed. Many businesses conceded that the drop in deep-pocketed Chinese visitors is being missed since they were oftentimes the main source of profit. KTO data showed that there was a 63.6 percent on-year drop in Chinese visitors this year as of April 9. The total that visited stood at 520,000. Given the current pace, the government expects the total number of Chinese visitors to be halved to less than 4 million for 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reflecting this, government officials on the resort island of Jeju, situated off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, confirmed it has been hurt by no-shows by Chinese tourists.It said that not only are duty-free shops run by big retail firms suffering a sharp drop in sales, but many small and midsized travel agencies, restaurants and accommodation businesses are struggling to stay afloat. While the repercussions are inevitable and painful, many have said that the blow from the Chinese ban has given them a hard lesson and the need to strive for change.Spearheaded by the KTO, the country is ramping up efforts to diversify its tourist portfolio to Japan and Southeast Asia, while shifting its primary target to individual travelers rather than group package tours. The state tourism agency plans to bolster viral promotions of getaways and relaxation programs for Japanese visitors through online and mobile channels. It will also work with the local food service industry to increase Muslim-friendly restaurants that serve halal dishes for those from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.By doing so, the country will seek to achieve a fresh annual target of 11.2 million non-Chinese tourists for this year, up from 9.17 million recorded a year earlier. A total of some 17 million foreigners visited South Korea last year.Both the central and regional governments plan to boost promotions for in-country travel for locals through discounts and other benefits, which can give new momentum to this critical service sector.Highlighting the need for change, Jeju Island suffered a 26.6 percent on-year fall in its Chinese tourist tally in the year to date, but its overall inbound number has risen nearly 3 percent from a year ago on the back of an on-year gain in the number of local visitors. Its provincial tourism authority said it plans to devise more incentive tours or school trip programs as part of a bid to lure not only locals but visitors from such places as Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. The provincial government of Jeju has recently clinched a deal with Philippine Airlines to fly chartered planes to the island until mid-June, from which it expects to draw at least 3,000 visitors from the Southeast Asian country. \"The current circumstances are hard to predict since the THAAD issue is a matter of diplomacy and security that needs to be resolved through political and diplomatic channels,\" said Lee Hoon, a professor at Hanyang University. \"In the short term, we need to focus on promotions and benefits that can give a boost to in-country travel, while seeking to reduce the Chinese dependency in tourism by diversifying foreign marketing.\" (Yonhap)","1325":"South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn urged Japan Thursday to squarely face history and show sincere remorse over its past occupation of the Korean Peninsula.Hwang made the call in an address marking the 98th anniversary of the establishment of Korea's provisional government in Shanghai, China, in 1919.

(Yonhap)","1330":"A lawyer for one of the women accused of murdering North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's estranged half brother with a chemical nerve agent said Tuesday that Malaysia has potentially compromised the case and that he's afraid his client will become a scapegoat.In an interview with The Associated Press, the attorney for Siti Aisyah said the man who he believes recruited his client was allowed to leave Malaysia late last month, after the country struck a surprise deal with North Korea.(Yonhap)\"(He) may not be implicated in the actual event of the murder, but his evidence is so important, central to our defense because it clearly shows how this naive girl was duped into doing things outside her knowledge,\" Gooi Soon Seng said at his office in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian police did not immediately respond to calls for comment, but they have said in recent weeks that the deal with North Korea did not affect the investigation. The Feb. 13 killing of Kim Jong-nam sparked a fierce diplomatic battle between two countries that once had warm relations. Aisyah and another woman, from Vietnam, have been charged with murder for allegedly smearing Kim's face with VX nerve agent at a bustling airport terminal. Although Malaysia never directly accused North Korea of carrying out the attack, speculation is rampant that Pyongyang orchestrated a hit on a long-exiled member of its ruling elite.The countries ended a tense standoff on March 31 with a deal that gave North Korea custody of Kim's body and allowed Malaysia to question three North Korean men who had been hiding in their country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian police then allowed the men to fly home, saying they found no grounds to hold them. It was an abrupt turnaround in the investigation. Earlier, Malaysia's national police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, had hinted that the men had valuable intelligence, saying he would wait to question them, \"even if it takes five years.\" One of the men identified by police is Ri Ji U, known by his nickname James.Gooi said James should not have been allowed to leave because he was key to Aisyah's defense. He said James had recruited Aisyah in early January to star in his video prank shows. Over the course of several days, he had her rub oil or pepper sauce on a victim's face, \"from forehead downwards,\" which he would film on his phone, the lawyer said.They practiced at malls, hotels and airports, Gooi said, speaking ahead of a court appearance Thursday by the two defendants in which prosecutors are expected to ask for the case to be moved to a higher court for the trial.Aisyah was paid about $100-$200 for each prank and hoped the income would allow her to stop working as a social escort, Gooi said. \"She was giving up that part of her life after meeting James and being given a role in the prank show. She was quite excited,\" he said. \"She was quite well remunerated and she was telling her friends about the fact she doesn't want to live the life of a social escort anymore.\"Gooi said that in January, Aisyah flew to Cambodia, where James introduced her to a man known as Chang. He said that Chang identified himself as a Chinese who produces video prank shows for the China market, and that Aisyah did three pranks at the airport in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital. Chang was later identified by Aisyah as Hong Song Hac, one of four North Korean suspects who fled Malaysia on the same day Kim was killed.Gooi said Hong asked Aisyah to do several more pranks at the Kuala Lumpur airport a few days before Kim was attacked. He said Aisyah met Hong at the airport on the day of the killing, and that Hong identified Kim to Aisyah and allegedly put the poison on her hand. \"The real culprit has escaped and the people who have been (used) become the scapegoats,\" Gooi said. \"By allowing James to go back when he could shed light on the truth of the matter, that would have compromised the defense and that I would say constitutes a miscarriage of justice.\"Although Malaysia says the three men who were allowed to leave the country have no bearing on the investigation, authorities here have asked Pyongyang to return the four North Korean suspects, including Hong, and have issued an Interpol red notice alert for them. (AP)","1331":"The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on major contenders in the forthcoming May 9 presidential election, using a SWOT analysis to present their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Below is the fourth installment on Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the conservative Bareun Party. -- Ed.\u00a0Rep. Yoo Seong-min (Yonhap)Like his party, Rep. Yoo Seong-min is a minor player in the race for presidency. Yoo\u2019s Bareun Party has one of the lowest approval ratings for a conservative party in recent history, and his own ratings remain far behind the front-runners. However, Yoo is not without his strengths. Born to a judge father in 1958 in Daegu, Yoo holds a doctorate in economics and has a long experience of working as a researcher on related issues. He entered politics in 2005 through a parliamentary by-election, grew in presence and served as the floor leader of the defunct Saenuri Party in 2015. StrengthsYoo has one clear advantage over his rivals \u2013--economic expertise. Yoo has a doctorate in economics and spent more than a decade as a researcher with the Korea Development Institute. Yoo also headed the conservative party\u2019s think tank from 2002 until 2005, when he entered politics. In contrast, Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea is a lawyer, while Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party is a medical doctor who later became a software developer. Liberty Korea Party\u2019s Hong Joon-pyo began his professional life as a public prosecutor. He is also known for speaking his mind regardless of the consequences. During his term at the KDI, he is said to have experienced unfair treatment for criticizing the Kim Dae-jung administration\u2019s economic policies. He also spoke out against those of the Park Geun-hye administration.WeaknessesThe connection to former President Park Geun-hye is one of Yoo\u2019s biggest weaknesses. Yoo was once a key ally of Park. However, after he criticized the idea of welfare without tax hikes, Park branded his actions a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and he was forced to run as an independent in the following Assembly elections, before rejoining the Saenuri Party. The \u201ctraitor\u201d brand was further strengthened when he defected from the party founded under Park\u2019s leadership to form the Bareun Party. This image is being emphasized by the Liberty Korea Party and their candidate Hong, as they claim that they are the \u201crightful heirs\u201d of Korean conservatism and that Yoo is a traitor. The low approval rating of Yoo\u2019s party is also working against Yoo. The party is one of the least popular. Its ratings fell to 4 percent in a recent Gallup Korea poll, matching that of the Justice Party. Yoo\u2019s support rating as a presidential candidate also remains far behind his rivals. The Gallup poll showed support for Yoo was at 4 percent, just over half that of Hong whose campaign was only officially launched Monday.OpportunitiesOpportunity is something Yoo appears to lack more than anything else. Polls showed the majority of voters support the two front-runners -- Moon and Ahn -- while Hong is going into overdrive to make up for lost time. Although Yoo claims that he is the right man to lead the conservatives, he and his party are still trailing behind the others, even in the conservative strongholds. However, his economic expertise could set him apart in the presidential candidates\u2019 televised debate. Of the scheduled three live debates, two are to be conducted without prepared materials, and Yoo\u2019s long experience as a researcher is expected by some people to give him an edge. The effect the debates will have on support ratings remains to be seen. Polls conducted after the debates held during the 2012 election showed that any changes in candidates\u2019 ratings were within the margin of error.\u00a0ThreatsFor Yoo, the main rival is not liberal front-runner Moon or centrist Ahn. It is Hong of the Liberty Korea Party, which he and his fellow Bareun Party politicians famously broke up with. Yoo and Hong are not just vying for the presidential job, but hegemony over the nation\u2019s fractured political right. Yoo is likely to face more attacks from his conservative rival and pressure to merge with Hong. Hong has voiced the need for the two parties to merge on numerous occasions, and has even gone as far as to claim that Yoo and his party would \u201cevaporate\u201d if a merger does not occur before the election. With less than four weeks until voting day, Yoo has to expand his presence fast if he is to complete the race, a feat even some in his own party are beginning to doubt. The party has for now settled on seeing Yoo\u2019s campaign through and Yoo has ruled out any form of alliance or merging his campaign with that of another.However, Rep. Kim Sung-tae -- the chief of Bareun Party\u2019s election committee -- has hinted at the possibility of an alliance with Ahn of the People\u2019s Party. Speaking on a radio interview, Kim said that politics is a living organism and that a politician must consider all possible means \u201cwithin the frame of the presidential race.\u201dBy Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","1332":"Presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in continues to pledge and claim his commitment to the security of the nation, while in reality he wishes to prove his loyalty to the country and not North Korea, observers here noted Wednesday.The presidential candidate of the largest Democratic Party has faced a series of attacks and accusations from conservative and liberal opponents alike, and observers said one such accusation he apparently wishes to get rid of the most is that he is pro-North Korea. Moon Jae-in (second row, C), the presidential candidate of the liberal Democratic Party, poses for a photo with a group of Air Force servicemembers during his visit to an Air Force Command in Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of Seoul, on April 7, 2017. (Yonhap)It was not the first time the former opposition leader has been called pro-North Korea in his 15-year political career. His earlier efforts to prove his innocence even included his controversial boasting of a military citation he was given decades ago by his then commander Chun Doo-hwan, who later staged a military coup to become president.The revelation, apparently aimed at proving his previous and current commitment to the country's security, backfired even among his die-hard followers as Chun has been convicted of ordering a bloody crackdown on a 1979 democratic uprising in Gwangju, the traditional powerbase of Moon's liberal party.And when the elected head of a small district office in Seoul again accused him of being a \"commie,\" Moon reacted quickly and angrily with a formal complaint, leading to a police investigation into the district office head this week.Such a reaction, observers note, showed the presidential candidate is aware how explosive the issue can be in South Korean politics, especially in an election year.South Korea and North Korea remain divided and are technically at war with each other as the 1950-53 Korean War ended only with an armistice agreement, not a peace treaty.Moon also could not afford to waste any time as Ahn Cheol-soo, the runner-up in opinion polls on the May 9 election, is now only few points away.Some of the most recent surveys have also placed the candidate from the center-left People's Party ahead of Moon.In a survey conducted by the Korea Research Center and released Sunday, Ahn posted an approval rating of 36.8 percent in a hypothetical five-way race, beating Moon at 32.7 percent.With less than four weeks left until the election, Ahn and others are persistently, and quite cleverly, attacking the front-runner's weakest link, the observers noted.Hong Joon-pyo, the presidential candidate of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, argued the United States may attack North Korea without even telling Seoul in advance should Moon or any other liberal candidate be elected.\"If a leftist regime comes into office here, would the US let our government know before preemptively striking North Korea when (the leftist government here) will tell North Korea?\" Hong said Tuesday, accusing both Moon and Ahn of being \"advocates\" of the communist North.Hong's persistent and renewed accusation apparently seeks to exploit the recent tension around the Korean Peninsula sparked by reports of a possibly imminent nuclear test by Pyongyang, the observers note.Washington quickly announced its dispatch of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, to the area, prompting concerns and even suspicions over a possible attempt to preemptively strike the reclusive North.Moon, apparently on his toes, voiced a strong warning against Pyongyang, saying a North Korea-initiated armed conflict will cost its very existence.\"I will prevent a war on the Korean Peninsula with everything I have,\" he said Monday, the same day Washington said it was redirecting the Carl Vinson Strike Group to the region from its original destination in Australia.The liberal candidate has also done an about-face on the ongoing deployment of US missile defense system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, whose fate, he earlier said, must be decided by the new, incoming administration.\"We must look squarely at the fact that THAAD deployment will be inevitable should North Korea continue its nuclear provocations,\" Moon said Tuesday.\"Should a war ever break out again on the Korean Peninsula, I will be the first to grab a weapon to fight for the lives of our people and the safety of our nation,\" he added.

(Yonhap)\"Since the US is rejecting the idea of holding multilateral negotiations, (we) will actively work to arrange talks between the US and North Korea,\" Sim quoted Wu as saying during the meeting. This was in response to Sim's request that China get more involved in bringing the North to the multilateral negotiating table aimed at dissuading its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\"(China) has always endeavored to resolve (the North's issue) through talks on the basis of the denuclearization principle. ... But there are states that have denied dialogue. One is North Korea, and the other is the United States,\" he added.Wu expressed concerns that rising tensions and the possibility of a war on the Korean Peninsula is a \"dangerous matter to everyone,\" comparing the situation with a torn fishing net that eventually kills the fish and leaves it to pollute the water.Wu also voiced frustration with the recalcitrant North, saying that the Kim Jong-un regime does not listen to China trying to dissuade it from developing nuclear weapons, calling it an intervention in its domestic affairs. \"We are also making efforts, but Kim Jong-un will not listen to us,\" he was quoted as saying. He still promised that China will continue to faithfully enforce relevant UN Security Council resolutions against the North to help its move toward denuclearization.Meanwhile, Wu repeated China's strong opposition to Seoul and Washington's decision to deploy an advanced missile defense system called THAAD in South Korea.\"The China-South Korea ties are facing challenges now, but the responsibility does not rest with China,\" he said. \"The THAAD issue is having an impact on the relations.\" Wu urged South Korea to recognize China's concerns and take necessary measures in a way that the friction caused by the THAAD deployment comes to be resolved. Last year, South Korea decided to host THAAD on its soil despite China's fierce opposition for fear that its strong radar could hurt its strategic security interests. Relations between the two have deteriorated ever since as China launched retaliatory measures targeting South Korean companies and goods, including Lotte Group, which provided the land necessary to house the THAAD battery.Wu admitted that Chinese people are complaining a lot about Lotte Group providing the site, but he denied the Chinese government's involvement in any retaliatory steps, saying that it is purely people's voluntary actions.

Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party -- it would be easier to reach above the 15 percent mark in their final voter turnout so they can retrieve their campaign expenses.But for most of the lower-tier figures, 15 percent is almost unreachable. This is part of the reason why they are grappling over the possible scenario of a merger by the upcoming weekend to avoid the full deposit payment for the main race.(Yonhap)According to the Public Official Election Act, presidential candidates are to submit 300 million won ($261,757) to the National Election Commission.Of the total amount, 20 percent, or 60 million won, is to be paid in advance during the preliminary registration period and the rest just ahead of the official campaign period.Once in the main race, candidates have to obtain a minimum of 10 percent of votes in order to reclaim half of their candidacy deposit, or 15 percent in order to retrieve the entire amount.If their turnout lingers below the 10 percent mark, all 300 million won is to revert to the nation\u2019s treasury, which is most often the case, except for a few prominent candidates.The only way for a preliminary candidate to preserve his or her deposit upon dropping out of the race is to make it to the party\u2019s final primary and lose. Those who step down voluntarily midway may not have access to their deposits, a rule which was introduced to limit excessive candidate entries.According to such regulations, Sohn Hak-kyu and Rep. Park Joo-sun -- aspirants of the People\u2019s Party who lost to party front-runner Rep. Ahn -- had their money returned upon withdrawing from the candidate list.But this will not be the case for Kim Jin and Ahn Sang-soo of the Liberty Korea Party, who earlier registered themselves as preliminary candidates and failed to reach the final primary.Of course, money isn\u2019t always the reason, or the only reason, behind every political maneuver. Even those who have a slim chance of reaching the 15 percent mark choose to complete the race for their own political cause. Rep. Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive minority Justice Party has a support rating of about 3-4 percent in opinion polls, but she has pledged to complete the race without dropping out this year.\u201cI will not drop out from the race nor partner with other opposition runners for a unified single candidacy. I will finish the race no matter what,\u201d Sim of the Justice Party told The Korea Herald in a recent interview. The progressive politics we pursue is to compete for responsibility, not radicalism or boldness. I\u2019m running because I think it is about time for our party to govern,\u201d she said. Bareun Party\u2019s Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who trails Sim in support ratings, also expressed determination to finish the race. \u201cI am not worried about the election fund. I have made up my mind to pursue direct contacts with voters through social media and other channels. Money isn\u2019t a major concern for me,\u201d he said. Campaign finance chiefs generally try to limit election spending to implement spending boundaries -- 50.9 billion won per candidate -- and to have as much of it as possible returned afterward by making it above the 15 percent mark on polling day.In the 18th presidential election in 2012, the then-ruling Saenuri Party and the then-main opposition Democratic United Party respectively got back 35.3 billion won and 46.7 billion won from the NEC.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1340":"The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of the nation's two umbrella labor organizations, on Monday declared its political endorsement for two progressive candidates in the country's presidential election.In a press conference held in Seoul, the KCTU said it supports Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party and Kim Sun-dong of the People's Union Party. The official declaration of support came on the sidelines of a ceremony marking Labor Day. Sim Sang-jeung (center), the presidential candidate of the Justice Party, poses for a picture with her supporters after holding an election campaign in Seoul on May 1, 2017. (Yonhap)Sim and Kim are considered the most progressive candidates in the presidential election to be held next Tuesday.Kim, for instance, is a former lawmaker of the former Unified Progressive Party, which was dissolved late 2014 by a Constitutional Court ruling that decided the party and its activities were pro-North Korea. His People's Union Party is also considered a de facto successor of the now defunct progressive party.The KCTU's official declaration of support for the two progressive candidates came one day after the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the larger of the two umbrella labor organizations here, announced its support for presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party.In the latest poll released Sunday, Moon enjoyed an approval rating of 42.6 percent, maintaining a wide distance from runner-up Ahn Cheol-soo of the People's Party with 20.9 percent.Sim placed fourth with 7.6 percent while Kim and eight other minor presidential hopefuls were not even included in the survey.\"Votes secured by Sim Sang-jeung and Kim Sun-dong can never be considered dead votes. Each vote they win will become a source of power in our fight in the future,\" the KCTU said.

A shift worker at an auto assembly line at Hyundai Motor Co. in Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province (Yonhap)The ratio of smokers among female shift workers was 1.73 times that of daytime workers, according to the survey conducted on 11,680 people. The numbers for female workers in their 50s reached 5.55 times those that work in the daytime.The report then said the proportion of women shift workers who suffer from a lack of sleep was 1.24 times that of daytime workers while the number for those in their 50s reached 1.5 times.The proportion of drinkers among female shift workers in their 50s was 2.2 times that of daytime workers while the comparable figures for those in their 20s and 40s were less.The data showed the amount of male shift workers suffering from sleep deprivation was 1.18 times that of daytime workers. It said for male workers, no real difference between shift and daytime workers was observed in smoking and drinking habits.The survey indicated women working odd hours are more susceptible to a lack of sleep and more prone to drinking and smoking because they are not as physically capable of maintaining irregular shifts.

If elected, the presidential front-runner said, he will completely remove the 11,000 won ($9.63) basic monthly fee charged to all mobile phone users. Moon Jae-in, the presidential candidate of the liberal Democratic Party, announces his election pledges regarding mobile phone service fees at a press conference in Changwon, 450 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on April 11, 2017. (Yonhap)Moon noted the average household spent 124,500 won a month in mobile communications fees.\"And yet, the three mobile phone service providers posted a combined operating profit of 3.6 trillion won last year,\" he told a press conference held in Changwon, an industrial city located some 450 kilometers southeast of Seoul, according to the party.\"Consumers are bombarded with excessive fees, while telecom companies continue to enjoy excessive profits,\" he was quoted as saying.Moon argued that the basic monthly fee was intended to support the installation of mobile communications networks, but facility investments related to such networks have already been completed.Moon's seven-point election pledge regarding communication services included an immediate removal of a current ceiling on subsidies provided on new phones by manufacturers or service providers.The presidential candidate noted the ceiling made new phones, including those manufactured in the country, up to 21 percent more expensive here than in other countries. The ceiling was a temporary measure aimed at preventing excessive competition, and is set to expire in October.Moon noted a reason for such a high communications fee was the high cost of the mobile data service.He said he will require all public facilities and government offices to provide free Wi-Fi services, while also encouraging mobile service providers to lower their service charges.The presidential candidate also vowed to work for a three-way agreement with China and Japan to introduce free roaming services for all their travelers visiting one another.

It has no specific stipulation on any pre-emptive attack. The two sides have operated the Combined Forces Command for a joint defense strategy.On Monday, Moon Jae-in, the presidential candidate of the liberal Democratic Party, stressed that South Korea should take the initiative in handling the North Korea issue.He said the US should not make a pre-emptive strike on the North without the consent of the South Korean people.The ministry official, meanwhile, denied rumors of a war crisis within the coming weeks, asking the public not to be misled by unconfirmed information spreading on cyberspace.Meanwhile, Army Col. Roh Jae-cheon, spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, also told reporters that there has been no indication of unusual activity by the North's troops.

Park, dismissed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, faces a probe on 13 criminal allegations, including graft and abuse of power. Upon arrival at the prosecution's office, Park said she will comply with the investigation with sincerity. (Yonhap)The investigation was wrapped up around 9:20 p.m. after more than 12 hours of intense questioning, the longest-running interrogation they have done so far on the former president since she was put behind bars last month.The investigators are planning to conduct one more interrogation on Wednesday before leveling formal charges against the country's former leader.Though prosecutors said they cannot confirm if Wednesday's inquiry will be the last, legal experts say it is likely that they will indict Park before next Monday, when the official campaign period for the May 9 election begins.Park was named an accomplice in her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil's bribery allegations involving South Korea's largest business group Samsung. She is also suspected of colluding with her friend in pressing local conglomerates into donating tens of billions of won to two non-profit foundations allegedly controlled by Choi.Both Park and Choi have denied the allegations.

The file photo shows the now-shuttered Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea's border city of the same name. (Yonhap)South Korean companies failed to take all of their products and equipment out of the complex as North Korea expelled South Korean nationals one day after Seoul shut down the zone on Feb. 10, 2016, in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests.The Ministry of Unification said that signs are detected that the position of vehicles belonging to local firms has changed though it cannot verify where or why they were moved.\"All remaining cars at the factory park belong to South Korean businessmen. North Korea should immediately stop using those vehicles without our authorization as the move is clearly an illegal act that violates local firms' property rights,\" Lee Eugene, a ministry spokesperson, told a regular press briefing.The factory zone, once hailed as the symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, had housed a total of 124 South Korean firms, hiring more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods such as clothes and utensils.In February, the ministry said that it had identified some \"attempts\" by North Korean authorities to sneakily take out and sell electric appliances like rice cookers from the complex.The government said it had asked China to notify its people to not buy goods produced at the industry park if North Korea seeks to sell them.

Moon Jae-in (R), the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Korea, shakes hands with a local resident in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, while visiting the industrial city located some 450 kilometers south of Seoul on April 11, 2017. (Yonhap)The planned construction would increase the total number of reactors at the Kori complex to 10, more than one third of all nuclear reactors in the country.South Korea currently operates 26 nuclear reactors, with 14 of them located in North and South Gyeongsang provinces, according to Moon. The 26 reactors generate about 30 percent of the country's overall power supply.Moon said if elected, he will also block any extension of operations for aged reactors at the atomic power plant located some 450 kilometers southeast of Seoul.The promises came as part of Moon's election pledges for Busan and the surrounding South Gyeongsang Province, and it was not clear whether the presidential candidate planned to apply the same standards for other nuclear power facilities across the country.However, Moon noted some 3.4 million people lived within a 30 kilometer radius of the Kori plant, while only some 50,000 people lived within the same distance from a nuclear power plant in northeastern Gangwon Province.Moon, a native of Geoje island in South Gyeongsang Province, also vowed to work to revitalize the local economy, including building a new, expanded airport for Busan, the country's second-largest city.Amid a continued slump in the shipbuilding industry, Busan's share in the country's overall gross domestic product has dipped to 3 percent in 2016 from 25 percent in 1975, he noted.\"There is a need to build an airport that will work as a gateway for passengers to and from the Southeast Asian region and meet the growing demand for air travel,\" Moon's election camp said in a press release. The election pledges were announced in a series of press conferences held in Busan and Changwon, an industrial city located west of Busan in South Gyeongsang Province.Moon said the airport, along with new seaports in the region, will help turn the area into an East Asian logistics hub.

Rowny made a visit to brief the Seoul government on Washington's arms reduction negotiations with Moscow, according to the documents.Former President Chun Doo-hwan (center) at a general election polling station in Seoul (Yonhap)\"As the US-Soviet Union talks go well if the US develops the SDI, the principle is the same that if we have just three nuclear weapons, the North would respond to calls for inter-Korean talks,\" Chun was quoted as saying in the documents. The SDI or strategic defense initiative, also known as Star Wars, is a missile defense system the Ronald Reagan administration proposed in the mid-1980s to counter missile threats from the Soviet Union, its Cold War rival at the time.Chun emphasized that South Korea didn't have a deep understanding of nuclear weapons since it owned none of them and that even if it had one, it would not use it. However, the army general-turned-president noted that Reagan's push for peace through strength in his early presidency helped induce the Soviet Union to the negotiation table on arms reduction. \"The communists would never respond to calls for negotiations unless they had weaknesses,\" he said.Military tensions grew high at the time as inter-Korean talks came to a halt over the joint military drills conducted by South Korea and the United States.Chun, who took power in a military coup on Dec. 12, 1979, is known to have promised to the US not to develop nuclear weapons during a meeting with Reagan in Seoul in November 1983 in a bid to get recognition for his political legitimacy.

For the first time, the presidential election will include two-day early voting on May 4 and May 5. Some have estimated that up to 15 percent of total voters will cast their ballots during the two-day early voting period, citing early voter turnout in last year\u2019s general elections. In the 2016 general election, about 20 percent of voters took advantage of early voting, with total turnout of 58 percent.(Yonhap)From May 3, the day before early voting begins, the prohibition on the publication of opinion polls takes effect. Under Article 108 of the Public Official Election Act, the results of polls cannot be published from six days prior to Election Day. The measure is aimed at preventing bandwagon and underdog effects from influencing voters. Although the article has faced criticism, the Constitutional Court ruled in 1999 that prohibiting the publication of poll results for a certain period ahead of an election is not unconstitutional. In its ruling, the Constitutional Court said the potentially negative effects of poll results are amplified nearer Election Day, saying the concerned parties would lack the time to address unfair or inaccurate poll results. \u201cFor both dates (the May 3-4 early voting and May 9 Election Day), May 2 will be the last date from which poll results are available, so (the object of) the regulation is unaffected,\u201d a National Election Commission official said. While the NEC sees no problem with the timing of the early voting and prohibition on the publication of polls, the tendencies of voters by region suggest the issue may not be as simple. Cities and provinces with clear political leanings have also shown higher than average early voter turnout. While nationally about 12.19 percent of eligible voters voted early in the last general elections, North Jeolla Province\u2019s figure came to 17.35 percent and that of South Jeolla Province hit 18.85 percent. North Gyeongsang Province recorded early voter turnout of 14.07 percent, while South Gyeongsang Province\u2019s figure was 12.19 percent. The Jeolla provinces are traditionally left-leaning, while the Gyeongsang provinces have long supported conservatives. In the 2012 presidential election, more than 80 percent of voters from the Jeolla provinces voted for Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea. The Gyeongsang provinces went the other way, with 80 percent of North Gyeongsang Province voters choosing Park Geun-hye.

(Yonhap)","1355":"WASHINGTON (Yonhap) -- US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed Friday to work closely together to convince North Korea to curb its nuclear program as they held their first summit talks overshadowed by surprise US military strikes against Syria the previous night.The two sides reached the agreement, sharing the view that the North's nuclear advancement has reached \"a very serious stage,\"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during a briefing on the outcome of the summit talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\u00a0Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) and US President Donald Trump (Yonhap)\"The two sides noted the urgency of the threat of North Korea's weapons program, reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, and committed to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions,\" Tillerson said. \"They agreed to increase cooperation and work with the international community to convince the DPRK to peacefully resolve the issue and abandon its illicit weapons programs,\" he said.Tillerson said there was no \"no kind of a package arrangement\" on the issue.\"But there's a real commitment that we work together to see if this cannot be resolved in a peaceful way. But in order for that to happen, North Korea\u2019s posture has to change before there\u2019s any basis for dialogue or discussions,\" he said.Trump told Xi that he welcomes any ideas China has on the issue and the US would be happy to work with Beijing. But he also made it clear that the US is \"prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to coordinate with us.\"The results fall short of high expectations that Trump would press Xi hard to solve the North Korea problem as the only country that has any meaningful influence over Pyongyang. (Yonhap)However, the talks produced progress in Trump's efforts to reduce the trade deficit with the world's No. 2 economy. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said that the two sides agreed to a \"100-day plan\" aimed at increasing US exports to China and reducing the trade deficit with the country.Tillerson said Trump accepted Xi's invitation to visit China.The talks were almost completely overshadowed by Thursday night's US missile attack on Syria.The surprise Tomahawk missile strikes, which came in response to Syria's use of deadly chemical weapons against civilians earlier this week, was seen as a powerful message to North Korea, Iran and other rogue states that Trump can take military action against them at any time.After the strikes, Trump addressed the nation and said that it is in the \"vital national interest\" of the US to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. The same could be said of the nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles Pyongyang has long pursued.The attack could also be a message to China that the US may act on its own unless China reins in the North.White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the attack \"sends a very strong signal not just to Syria but throughout the world.\"Earlier in the day, Trump said that \"tremendous progress\" was made in US relations with China.\"I think we have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China. My representatives have been meeting one-on-one with their counterparts from China and I think truly progress has been made. We'll be making a lot of additional progress,\" Trump said after talks with Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\"The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding. We look forward to being together many times in the future and I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\" he said without elaborating.It was unclear if the \"bad problems\" include North Korea.In response, Xi said the two sides \"arrived at many common understandings,\" including the need to deepen friendship.\"I believe that with the passage of time we will make efforts to bear our great historical responsibility for promoting the development of Sino-US relations, to create prosperity for both countries and their people and to uphold global peace and stability,\" Xi said.The summit came as North Korea has been ratcheting up tensions with a series of banned ballistic missile launches, including the latest one earlier this week, in pursuit of the development of a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the US. Trump has long said North Korea is China's problem to fix.But Beijing has been reluctant to use its leverage for fears that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and even its collapse, which could lead to the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation on its border.Trump said in an interview with the Financial Times published Sunday that China should help with the problem by using the \"great influence\" it has over Pyongyang, warning that if it doesn't, the US will solve the problem on its own, and that \"won't be good for anyone.\"The Trump administration has shown increasing impatience with the North, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson openly mentioning the possibility of using military options during a trip to South Korea last month. After Tuesday's missile launch by the North, Tillerson issued an unusually blunt statement saying the US \"has spoken enough about North Korea.\"The summit was also watched closely as to whether the US stands up to China for bullying South Korea for hosting the US THAAD missile defense system designed to defend better against ever-growing missile threats from North Korea.It was unclear if the issue was raised during the talks.","1356":"China's top nuclear envoy will visit South Korea next week to discuss North Korea's nuclear provocations and the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system here, Seoul's foreign ministry said Thursday.During a five-day stay here that starts on Monday, Wu Dawei will hold a series of meetings with his South Korean counterpart Kim Hong-kyun including the North's imminent nuke test and other issues, according to the ministry.The meeting between the chief nuclear envoys from South Korea and China came in four months after they met in Beijing in December.Tensions run high amid speculation that the North may carry out a major provocation including an additional nuclear test in time for the Trump-Xi meetings scheduled for Thursday and Friday at the U.S. leader's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. China's top nuclear envoy may also deliver his country's opposition to the installation of the missile defense system, called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) here.Last year, South Korea decided to host the THAAD on its soil despite China's fierce opposition. Relations between them have since deteriorated as China launched retaliatory measures by turning back imports from South Korea, ordering the suspension of South Korean businesses in China, and canceling cultural and entertainment events.The Chinese officials are said to have a plan to meet with presidential hopefuls here, diplomatic sources said.

With North Korea topping the agenda, their two-day gathering is to pose an early test of the two countries\u2019 diplomacy. The two leaders will also face off over China\u2019s escalating economic retaliation against South Korea over the ongoing deployment of the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile assets here, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, trade and other bilateral, regional and global issues. Pyongyang has in recent months been carrying out a series of missile and engine tests, with satellite imagery pointing to signs of a fresh underground detonation. In the latest provocation, it fired a ballistic missile into the East Sea on Wednesday, though it appears to have failed. While carrying out a North Korea policy review, Washington has displayed its willingness to sanction more Chinese companies dealing with North Korea, and raised the possibility for military action as one of its options. Trump has indicated he will use trade as leverage to press Beijing to play a greater role in containing the Kim Jong-un regime\u2019s nuclear and missile program. He also called North Korea a \u201chumanity problem\u201d Tuesday, and warned that the US is ready to tackle it on its own if China does not help, in an interview released Sunday. In a phone call later in the day with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump also said that \u201call options are on the table\u201d and called the North\u2019s newest missile launch a \u201cdangerous provocation and grave security threat,\u201d Abe told reporters. Matt Pottinger, senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, called the secondary sanctions a \u201cvery much live\u201d question for the summit, saying China has the ability to squeeze the North \u201cin a way that no other single country can.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like to see China working closely with the US to address the menace emanating from North Korea, their weapons programs, the provocations that we\u2019ve seen every week, missile launches, including one that we had not too many hours ago,\u201d he said at a separate news conference Wednesday for foreign press. \u201cI think that North Korea long ago ceased to be a strategic asset for China. It is now quite clearly a strategic liability and it is one that is having an impact on the region. It is one that has the potential to destabilize not only the peninsula, but really the region as well.\u201dSeoul\u2019s National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin (Yonhap)Seoul, for its part, has been intensifying diplomatic efforts to raise its voice on North Korea and China\u2019s THAAD retaliation. Seoul\u2019s National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin and US National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster held a phone conversation early Thursday, condemning Pyongyang\u2019s ongoing missile liftoffs and reaffirming the THAAD stationing plan, Cheong Wa Dae said. Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs at the Foreign Ministry here, also had separate phone calls with the top nuclear negotiators of the US and Japan -- Joseph Yun and Kenji Kanasugi -- to review the newest missile test and coordinate responses to Pyongyang\u2019s additional provocations, the ministry said. Following the Trump-Xi meetings, Washington would seek a top-level consultation to brief Seoul on its results and facilitate joint next steps, a ministry official told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity. \u201cWe expect the forthcoming US-China summit will provide a critical chance in the international community\u2019s efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue,\u201d ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said at a regular news briefing, noting Pottinger\u2019s portrayal of Pyongyang as Beijing\u2019s strategic liability. \u201cSouth Korea and the US share a solid view that China\u2019s role is more important than anything else in leading North Korea to the path of denuclearization.\u201d By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1358":"Efforts to move the retrieved Sewol ferry onshore faced difficulties Thursday as engineers failed to load the wreck, heavier than originally expected, on transporters Thursday, delaying further search operations.The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said that it encountered some technical problems with modular trailers placed underneath the ferry.Sewol ferry shrouded in thick fog in Mokpo Port on Thursday (Yonhap)\u201cWe ran a test operation to carry the ferry on 480 transport trailers until this morning, but found technical problems that we need to check before giving it another try,\u201d Lee Cheol-jo, the head of the government-led operation team, told reporters.The ministry plans to relocate the transporters and try again before April 10, when the first neap tide of the month ends.The unfavorable weather conditions on Thursday morning, with waves as high as 3.1 meters, also hampered the underwater search of the wreck site, the ministry added. The ministry said it began a second round of test operations at around 2:15 p.m., while the result has not come out as of Thursday 5 p.m.Sewol, which sank in waters off Jindo in 2014, is currently on board a semisubmersible transport vessel at Mokpo Port, waiting to be moved to a dry dock for a search of its interior. The nation\u2019s worst maritime accident left 295 dead, mostly high school students on a school trip. Nine are still unaccounted for. Although some experts cautioned that the ferry is too heavy to move with modular trailers, the ministry said it will not utilize extra trailers for the time being. Currently, some 480 units of transporters are deployed to make a loading platform for Sewol. Each can carry up to 40 tons. The wreck, originally an 8,000-8,500-ton vessel, is estimated to weigh about 14,500 tons, with seawater and mud inside.Since the Sewol arrived at Mokpo last week, operators have been draining water and mud from the hull in order to reduce the overall weight. In case the operation is delayed again, the ministry is considering to begin a search for missing bodies inside without placing the ferry on land, with the consent of bereaved families and the special investigation committee.As of Thursday, a total of 101 items presumed to belong to the passengers on Sewol have been retrieved from the wreck, the ministry said.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","1359":"Prosecutors on Thursday grilled former President Park Geun-hye at a detention center again over corruption allegations that removed her from office.Prosecutors arrived at the detention house in Uiwang, south of Seoul, at around 11 a.m. Former President Park Geun-hye leaves her home in Seoul for prosecution questioning on March 21, 2017.

Below is the third installment, on Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party. -- Ed.Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province and presidential candidate of the conservative Liberty Korea Party (Yonhap)Former star prosecutor and political firebrand. These are the two key characteristics that define Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province and presidential candidate for the conservative Liberty Korea Party.Hong became the most unexpected player in this year\u2019s earlier-than-planned presidential election, suddenly emerging as the only plausible candidate for the conservative party, which has reeled under the consequences of embattled President Park Geun-hye\u2019s ouster.His reputation in the political arena tends to run to extremes, mostly due to his frequently controversial way of speaking. But in the absence of other competitive candidates, the hard-line conservative camp chose to bet on his conspicuous personal character in an effort to jolt the drift of the progressive-leaning presidential race.StrengthsHong\u2019s greatest strength is his tenacious and uncompromising image, which connects him to his past career as a successful senior prosecutor as well as his ranking role within the conservative political arena.Though often triggering backlash from dissenters, his direct manner of speech and frequent use of strong terms has also tended to intensify a sense of unity among stronghold groups.The governor\u2019s words may be rough, but his policies and vision have always been crystal clear and easy to understand, according to supporters. Having been out of partisan politics the past few years -- although mainly due to legal wrangling over bribery allegations -- Hong was saved from damage in the conservative debacle that followed President Park\u2019s scandal and fall from power. WeaknessesHong\u2019s greatest strength is his most vulnerable point. His disputed remarks and carefree actions have driven voters, even some who consider themselves conservative, away to centrist alternatives such as Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party.His increasingly aggressive comments against the liberal camp and high unfavorability have also won him the nickname \u201cHong-Trump,\u201d in reference to outspoken US President Donald Trump.The ongoing court trial on his bribery allegations is another obstacle for the presidential aspirant. Though he was acquitted at the high court last month, Hong still faces a final decision from the Supreme Court, upon which his governorship and presidential candidacy will depend.\u201cI shall consider committing suicide, should I be ruled guilty (of bribery charges),\u201d Hong has said, in another example of controversial speech.OpportunitiesAs a conservative political celebrity who has not been closely associated with ousted President Park and her cluster, Hong is a rare figure within the embattled Liberty Korea Party who may possibly join forces with the splinter Bareun Party and its candidate Rep. Yoo Seong-min.As both Hong and Yoo have stalled in polls with single-digit support, it has been deemed crucial for the groups to reunite ahead of the imminent May 9 presidential election.Rep. Yoo, who titles himself a reformist and rational conservative, has so far reserved comment on candidate unification, though he has alluded to the possibility, either with his home conservative party or centrist figures.Assuming conservative unity, the ongoing rivalry between liberal Moon Jae-in and centrist Ahn Cheol-soo could deliver the conservative standard-bearer an opportunity to stand almost equal to the two front-runners. \u201cIf four camps, each representing the progressives, liberals, centrists and conservatives face off in an election, conservatives prevail. That is the picture I have for this election, too,\u201d Hong said.ThreatsThat Hong is not an insider in the pro-Park faction also means he has relatively weak ties with the conservative party\u2019s leadership and key figures.Though he served as a lawmaker in the party for four terms and party chairman, Hong has been away from the party\u2019s central headquarters in recent years as he has served as a provincial governor.Observers also suggest his disputed comments, especially those in the form of slander against rivals, may boomerang on him and further cut down his already low support rating.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1363":"A group of government and military officials from Lebanon are set to arrive in South Korea on Wednesday for an eight-day visit aimed at better understanding the country, the South's military said.The trip is part of a program that is aimed at promoting South Korea's image to people in Lebanon where the country has stationed the Dongmyeong military unit since 2007 as part of UN peacekeeping troops.

Ranking second in polls among candidates from all parties, he has now to face down front-runner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea. Ahn Cheol-soo raises hands as he was named the presidential candidate of the People`s Party in Daejeon, Tuesday. (Yonhap)\u201cIn a humble heart and solemn determination, I hereby accept the candidacy of the People\u2019s Party for the 19th presidential election,\u201d Ahn said, after being announced the final winner in the party\u2019s convention to finalize its presidential candidate. The centrist party with 39 seats of the 300-seat National Assembly on Tuesday held its final primary in Daejeon, following its six previous regional primaries held across the nation.Ahn\u2018s final tally was 75.01 percent, taking 72.71 percent of the 184,184 valid on-site votes nationwide and 84.2 percent in public polls, according to the party\u2019s election committee chief Rep. Chang Byoung-wan.The sweeping result was no surprise, as Ahn had effectively sealed his victory from the very start of the regional rounds by raking in 64 percent of the electorate\u2019s support in the initial primary held in the party\u2019s stronghold of the Honam region -- Gwangju and North and South Jeolla Provinces -- on March 26. His overwhelming lead continued during the following primaries, further widening the gap with rivals Sohn Hak-kyu and Park Joo-sun.Despite Ahn\u2019s assured victory, Sohn and Park did their share in the competition to the end, gingering up the spirits of the event and presenting their slogans to the party audience.Their supporters also attended the convention in a festive mood, accepting Ahn\u2019s obvious win and calling for internal unity hereafter.\u201cPresident Ahn Cheol-soo and Prime Minister Sohn Hak-kyu!\u201d some of Sohn supporters shouted out during a recess, reflecting their compromising expectations.\u201cI shall join hands with Sohn and Park, the two candidates who have accompanied me in this passionate journey, and achieve victory at all costs,\u201d Ahn said.It was Sohn\u2019s suggestion of an open primary and Park\u2019s leverage as senior lawmaker in the key strategic region -- the nation\u2018s southwestern city Gwangju -- that further revitalized the party\u2019s primaries, according to Ahn.Embracing Sohn\u2019s request, the party had adopted an open primary system for the first time, to fully allow non-party members to participate in the candidate selection. The result was comprised by 80 percent on-site votes and 20 percent public polls, according to party officials.Facing his role as leading centrist candidate, Ahn once again distanced himself from burgeoning talks of possible unity with other camps.\u201cI, Ahn Cheol-soo, shall become a president for the people, by the people, of the people,\u201d he said.\u201cI will not form an alliance for the sake of political interests. I will not form an alliance to pardon those who opposed (former President Park Geun-hye\u2019s) impeachment. I will not form an alliance just to oppose a specific person.\u201dTalks of candidate unification have been pivoting upon runner-up Ahn, so as to form a centrist-conservative alliance against liberal front-runner Moon. But Ahn has so far pledged to first prove his own competitive power, without relying on solidarity.Meanwhile, Ahn and the party\u2019s leadership have adopted a dual strategy to call for change of government on one hand and hold back rival Moon on the other.Taking aim at the embattled Park Geun-hye administration, Ahn stressed his career as a self-made man, rising from a medical doctor to successful entrepreneur and then to a non-party-affiliated presidential aspirant.\u201cIf not for her deceased father, the former President Park Chung-hee, how would Park Geun-hye have ever become president? If not for his father, would Lee Jae-yong risen as chief of Samsung Group?\u201d Ahn asked in a forceful tone during his remarks.He thus appealed to public animosity against the former president and the nation\u2019s most celebrated conglomerate successor, both currently under arrest for their involvement in the extensive corruption scandal that led to Park\u2019s impeachment.Party Chairman Rep. Park Jie-won, who formerly served as floor leader of the Democratic Party, lashed out directly at Moon.\u201cMoon is an absurd character,\u201d the smoothly spoken party chief said, pointing to some aggressive campaigns led by Moon\u2019s aides.Park asserted that Moon is a factional type who will only prioritize his aides and exclude dissenters from benefits, should he obtain power.Also, floor leader Rep. Joo Seung-yong demanded Moon clarify allegations that his son was offered irregular employment favors, comparing the case to that of Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, who Park\u2019s scandal pivots around.The People\u2019s Party was the only among the top four parties to hold its final primary in Daejeon or the surrounding Chungcheong area instead of the Seoul-Gyeonggi Province metropolitan region.It was in this city that the splinter group from the Democratic Party held its inauguration ceremony in February last year, leading up to the April 13 parliamentary election.\u201c(Daejeon) is the birthplace of the Youth Concert, of political revolution, and of the multiparty parliamentary structure which we achieved,\u201d said Ahn.The region, which has often taken political neutrality, is also where the centrist party is hoping to further boost its approval rating by absorbing those formerly dedicated to South Chungcheong Province Gov. An Hee-jung.

Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet also expressed skepticism toward additional deployment of US strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula, although he did not rule out the possibility for such a measure should North Korea\u2019s military threats evolves further.\u00a0Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet (Yonhap)Pyongyang has been spurring its SLBM development since the regime successfully test-fired the missile in August. But controversy has persisted over the North\u2019s ability to deploy an SLBM-enabled submarine to battle lines.\u201cTo launch the missiles under the water is very, very complicated. I think it is still years away before that technology is developed,\u201d Swift said during an interview with The Korea Herald and other news outlets at the US Naval Forces Korea command in Seoul.\u201cIt\u2019s more important to focus on the general ballistic missile capability that North Korea is developing,\u201d said the admiral, referring to Pyongyang\u2019s latest launch of medium-range ballistic missiles that used SLBM technology and solid fuel technology.The admiral was in Seoul as part of a three-day trip to South Korea. On Tuesday, he attended an international forum to discuss amphibious operation in the Asia-Pacific region and met with South Korea\u2019s military leadership, including Gen. Lee Sun-jin, chairman of South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff. Despite speculation the North has inched closer to completing SLBM technology, he stressed that Pyongyang has yet to secure key elements crucial for a successful launch: the missile technology and the miniaturization of nuclear weapons. \u201cThere are two broad elements to focus on. One is missile technology itself: both the physics of developing the missile and its reliability as well as accuracy of the missile. The other element is miniaturization of nuclear capability.\u201d Confronted with North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear and missile threat, the commander has been expanding the role of the 3rd Fleet by forward deploying its strategic assets to the 7th fleet, whose area of operation mostly encompasses South Korea, Japan and China. Last month, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was deployed to the Korean Peninsula after departing San Diego, where the headquarters of the 3rd Fleet is located. After entering the 7th Fleet area of operation, The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier remains under the 3rd Fleet\u2019s command and control. But the admiral said although the US Navy will continue to expand its involvement in the Asian-Pacific region, there would be no additional \u201cforward deployment\u201d of US aircraft carriers and other strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet (Yonhap)\u201cOne of the great advantages of naval power is its flexibility to deploy, but I don\u2018t see any additional carriers being forward deployed. ... The challenge we have is the facility for maintaining and sustaining our ships.\u201d \u201cWe will reach 60 percent of naval forces present in the Pacific by 2020. And all those decisions have been made and investments have been made. It\u2018s probably 57 or 58 percent. But it fluctuates from day to day.\u201d When asked about whether the US Navy would dispatch its stealthy destroyer Zumwalt -- an idea reportedly floated by Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific Command, during a meeting with South Korean lawmakers, Adm. Swift expressed skepticism, but added \u201canything is possible.\u2019 \u201cAnything is possible. We can have the entire US Navy move somewhere. But it is very, very premature to discuss the probability of that. I would not recommend forward deploying it until we have fully have worked through challenges,\u201d he said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","1371":"South Korean prosecutors on Tuesday grilled former President Park Geun-hye at a detention facility, where she is in custody, as part of a continuing investigation into a scandal that led to her removal from office and arrest. Prosecutor Han Woong-jae led the interrogation from 10 a.m.\u00a0to 8:40 p.m. at a makeshift investigation room at Seoul Detention Center south of Seoul, where she has been jailed since Friday. The session took place inside the facility at Park\u2019s request.\u00a0It was the first\u00a0questioing since she was detained Friday. Former President Park Geun-hye is taken to a detention house in Uiwang on Friday morning. (Yonhap)Two of Park\u2019s lawyers, Yoo Young-ha and Chae Myung-sung, were present. The investigation was not recorded by video.Outside the prison, some 50 supporters for Park rallied, calling for her immediate release. Some of them burst into tears and others shouting \u201cGive me back our president,\u201d waving the national and US flags. Park faces a total of 13 criminal charges, but Tuesday\u2019s interrogation was said to have focused on Park\u2019s alleged collusion with her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to coerce donations from local firms\u00a0including Samsung Group. Choi and Samsung Group\u2019s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong are also in custody at the same detention facility.Park is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won ($69.6 million) from local firms, including Samsung Group, for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. An independent counsel team, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, concluded that part of Samsung\u2019s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung\u2019s Lee is standing trial for offering or promising to offer bribes to Park and Choi.If convicted of bribery, which carries the heaviest punishment among all the charges, Park could be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of at least 10 years.Park has flatly denied all the charges, saying local firms voluntarily made donations for the foundations. But her denial is one of the reasons the prosecution saw the possibility of Park destroying evidence and sought an arrest warrant to detain her. It remains to be seen whether Park and Choi will sit down together to go through a cross interrogation. The prosecution ruled out the possibility during a briefing Monday.\u00a0Choi also\u00a0sternly denied her involvement in the bribery scheme during the first hearing on her bribery case Tuesday.\u201cThe independent counsel set me up in a bribery frame when I don\u2019t know anything about Samsung Group\u2019s managing structure,\u201d Choi said during the hearing. \u201cPark\u2019s arrest results from my wrong judgment and behavior. I am also sorry to Samsung Group (which donated money) out of good will.\u201dThe independent counsel suspects Park and Choi of sharing economic benefits. At the hearing, the prosecution revealed statements by staff members who had worked at a dress shop that manufactured some of Park\u2019s clothing. According to their statements, Choi directly paid them in cash for Park\u2019s clothing, rental fees for the shop and their salary until late last year.\u00a0Park\u2019s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against artists with liberal views.As Park lost her presidential immunity after being expelled from power on March 10, she was summoned for questioning on March 21 for the first time and was grilled at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office for some 11 hours. The arrest warrant for Park is valid until April 19. The prosecution is expected to file charges against her by mid-April to minimize the impact Park\u2019s arrest will have on the May 9 presidential election.The prosecution is also speeding up a probe into Woo Byung-woo, the former presidential secretary for civil affairs, by summoning him for questioning scheduled for Thursday. He is suspected of assisting or condoning Choi\u2019s meddling in state affairs.

Cruising toward a landslide victory in the in-party contest, scheduled to end Tuesday, he has also seen a notable rise in support ratings.\u00a0 Ahn is now the second most popular presidential hopeful, after longtime front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea.StrengthAhn\u2019s most conspicuous strength is his unique centrist position, appealing to swing voters who would neither support the conservative camp after the impeachment of conservative President Park Geun-hye, nor front-runner Moon of the main liberal party.He also has a solid political background as the founder and inaugural chief of the third-largest People\u2019s Party, which holds 39 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.\u00a0 Along with Moon, Ahn is among the few presidential aspirants with a prepared vision for state management, having run in the 2012 election campaign as a main candidate.WeaknessIn South Korea\u2019s polarized politics and longstanding conservative-liberal rivalry, Ahn\u2019s \u201ccentrist\u201d stance has been acting as a double-edged sword, winning him support from the swing voters on one hand but triggering criticism for ambiguity on the other. Although Ahn has witnessed a notable rise in polls, recently outrunning those of Democratic runner-up figures, his support stands around half of that of front-runner Moon as of the last week of March, according to multiple local pollsters.Another weakness of the entrepreneur-turned-lawmaker is that he has no actual experience in state governance. As founder and former chief of computer virus vaccine developer company Ahn Lab, the politician frequently underlined his entrepreneur leadership, claiming it to be a crucial virtue for a state leader.Yet, it nevertheless remains that he lacks experience in state administration when compared to his potential rivals. Moon served as presidential chief of staff in the former liberal Roh Moo-hyun government while conservative candidate Hong Joon-pyo is currently governor of South Gyeongsang Province.OpportunityAhn\u2019s opportunity for momentum is a possible consolidation of the conservative and centrist fields around a single candidate who has the best chance at stopping Moon. Although uniting for a single anti-Moon candidacy would be a path fraught with peril for all parties involved, Ahn has a clear advantage in the game as recent polls show he is only 3.5-6 percentage points behind Moon in a hypothetical two-way matchup. Since an earlier-than-planned presidential election started to take shape, Ahn has been mentioned as a plausible partner for several political groups, ranging from the minority conservative Bareun Party, independent centrist figures to runner-up candidates of the Democratic Party.The fact that he refused to compromise and recorded a sweeping victory in the party\u2019s regional primaries further increased his leverage among the non-Moon figures.His other chance is that the conservative-leaning voters, finding no eligible runners in the Liberty Korea Party or the Bareun Party, may turn to the centrist Ahn as the next best solution.ThreatBut despite all potential scenarios, Ahn is still greatly outrun by Moon. And his People\u2019s Party\u2019s political clout is overshadowed by the conservative and liberal camps.\u00a0 According to local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, Moon kept his lead among presidential candidates for 13 consecutive weeks with 35.2 percent in approval ratings, while Ahn reached 17.4 percent. A Gallup poll, released Friday, puts Ahn at 19 percent against Moon\u2019s 31 percent. In the country\u2019s unicameral parliament, Moon\u2019s Democratic Party controls 120 of the 300 seats, followed by the main conservative Liberty Korea Party\u2019s 93. Ahn\u2019s People\u2019s Party has only 39 seats.\u00a0 Although he would need support of conservative votes to stop Moon, efforts to win them could backfire among the liberal minds, as seen in the latest controversy over his remark on pardoning former President Park Geun-hye. Some also suggest that in case the two conservative parties successfully unify their candidates, the election may turn into a conservative-vs-liberal match, thus overshadowing the centrist Ahn\u2019s group.By Bae Hyung-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1381":"South Korea is taking a two-pronged approach to search for the nine missing passengers of the Sewol ferry in case the bodies are not all found inside the retrieved wreck.\u00a0As engineers proceeded Sunday with preparations to move the ill-fated ferry ashore, currently loaded on a semisubmersible transport vessel at Mokpo Port, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced a plan to resume an underwater search of the wreck site.\u00a0 Workers clear mud from the Sewol (Yonhap)Starting from Sunday night, 50 divers were to begin work in rotation to search the seabed area of about 32,000 square meters, where the sunken Sewol lay for nearly three years until it was lifted out of the water last week. In order to prevent the victims\u2019 bodies from being lost during the lifting process, salvage engineers installed an underwater steel fence 200 meters long, 160 meters wide and 3 meters high. The area inside the fence was divided into 40 sections for detailed search.\u00a0\u201cThe maritime search operation inside the fence should begin tonight,\u201d said Lee Cheol-jo, an official from the Oceans Ministry who oversees the salvage and search operation. But the official cautioned that strong tide in the area might prevent active searching by divers. \u201cWe have strong tides today and may face difficulty diving,\u201d Lee added. Sewol sank nearly three years ago in the nation\u2019s worst peace-time maritime disaster, leaving over 300 dead, mostly high school students on a field trip. Nine passengers are still unaccounted for. The search for those missing has been on hold since November 2014, when the government decided to salvage the ship without cutting it into pieces.On Sunday, some belongings of Sewol passengers were found as engineers worked to remove mud from the recovered ferry, which was transported to Mokpo Port on Friday. The ship is expected to be moved to a dry dock Thursday. Among objects found were handbags, cards and pens, which presumably belonged to the victims, as well as the passport of the ship\u2019s captain Lee Jun-seok, who is in prison on a life sentence for abandoning the ship and its passengers.\u00a0The search team also found fragments of animal bones on the ferry\u2019s deck Sunday, where the team had found pieces of animal bone last week. The authorities had initially thought the pieces came from victims until the forensic experts said otherwise.\u00a0The government began the work of bringing the Sewol ashore by sending the first batch of transporters to pull the wreckage out of the transport vessel carrying it. The whole package of transporters is expected to arrive Thursday.\u00a0About 80 workers will be deployed to remove the mud and the whole process will be conducted manually, the ministry said, citing concerns that remains of the victims or their belongings, if any, could be damaged during the search operation.\u00a0\u201cWe are going to proceed cautiously and slowly,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIt is not something that requires high-level expertise. What\u2019s more important is how we handle (the situation), when we come across bodies.\u201d By Yeo Jun-seok (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","1382":"In protest against South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy a US advanced missile defense system, China has conducted multiple cyberattacks against the South Korean government and business sectors, said a former US Pacific Fleet commander Thursday.Retired Adm. Patrick Walsh, who is now vice president of customer education at American cybersecurity firm FireEye, suggested that there is \u201cclear correlation\u201d between the increased number of China-originated cyberattacks and South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system.Retired Adm. Patrick Walsh, who is now vice president of customer education at American cybersecurity firm FireEye after serving as a commander of the US Pacific Fleet Command (Yonhap)\u201cThe correlation appeared to be clear. This is connected to the request by the South Korean government for the deployment of THAAD,\u201d Walsh said at a press conference in Seoul.\u201cWe have seen over time the evolution of Chinese espionage program. Early on, they have focused on defense industrial programs and the focus was on intellectual property theft. \u2026 Most recently, (we are seeing) the example of the THAAD hacktivism.\u201dAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the California-based cybersecurity firm claimed Chinese state-backed hackers have recently targeted South Korean entities involved in deploying THAAD. Among them were the South Korean government, military, defense companies and a big conglomerate, the company added. The former navy commander reiterated the assertion, adding that China might have targeted entities and groups that support the THAAD system, rather than attacking the military platform itself. \u201cMy understanding of where those attacks taking place had been more in the support of THAAD, rather than the THAAD system itself. \u2026 My understanding from open source, news release information is that THAAD system itself was not affected, but their supporting elements may have been targeted for the attack.\u201dWhile highlighting the vulnerability of the network system being used for the military platform, the admiral declined to comment on whether Chinese state-backed hackers could neutralize THAAD\u2019s missile defense capability by hacking into the platform\u2019s data-link system. China has long opposed the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, saying its radar system can reach deep into its own territory and compromise its security. On Wednesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry called for the withdrawal of THAAD, warning it would take the \u201cnecessary steps needed to protect\u201d its own interests.Describing China and Russia as the \u201cmost prevalent and skilled sponsor\u201d for cyberattacks, the retired admiral suggested that Beijing has used the attacks as a means to advance its military technology, protect the Chinese Communist Party and enhance its geopolitical interest. North Korea, on the other hand, has looked for more \u201csymbolic objective\u201d when engaging in cyberattacks, he noted, suggesting that the community country had used the attacks to protect the leadership\u2019s image and promote national pride.One example is Pyongyang\u2019s cyberattack against Sony Pictures in 2014, when the film company tried to release \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a comedy movie about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. \u201cThe attack was destructive and explosive,\u201d said Walsh. \u201cIn my country, it prompted the question of where and what is the role of the government when it comes to companies that are attacked by (a) nation state. The answer that we give is we don\u2019t advocate offensive capability or hacking back,\u201d he said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","1383":"The Donald Trump administration is seeking to step up sanctions and pressure as its key drivers to tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, while engaging the regime through diplomacy, top US officials said Wednesday. Following a two-month review, the administration is said to have recently settled on its North Korea policy, dubbed \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement.\u201d Trump hosted a rare closed-door briefing for all 100 senators at the White House, after which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats issued a joint statement, vowing efforts to boost pressure on Pyongyang.US Defense Secretary James Mattis (center) and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford (right) depart after briefing members of the US Senate on North Korea at the White House in Washington on Wednesday. (Reuters-Yonhap)\u201cPast efforts have failed to halt North Korea\u2019s unlawful weapons programs and nuclear and ballistic missile tests,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe president\u2019s approach aims to pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear, ballistic missile, and proliferation programs by tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with our allies and regional partners.\u201d Calling the weapons programs an \u201curgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority,\u201d the three officials called for the world to join its campaign, while sending the message the door is still open for talks. \u201cWe are engaging responsible members of the international community to increase pressure on (North Korea) in order to convince the regime to deescalate and return to the path of dialogue,\u201d it said. \u201cWe remain open to negotiations towards that goal. However, we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies.\u201dThe unprecedented statement is apparently designed to serve as the pinnacle of the Trump administration\u2019s weekslong show of force and warnings against an additional major provocation. With speculation soaring over another nuclear test, Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the secretaries have been sharply ratcheting up pressure against the Kim Jong-un regime. They forward deployed a nuclear-powered supercarrier and other cutting-edge military assets toward the peninsula, floated military action and warned the North \u201cnot to test\u201d the US\u2019 resolve, while pressing China to take a greater role in reining in its wayward neighbor. While carrying a more moderate tone relative to recent weeks\u2019 shrill rhetoric, the statement lacks details that may point to a fresh strategy and tactics. The officials have repeatedly declared the demise of the \u201cstrategic patience\u201d policy favored by previous President Barack Obama. But sanctions and pressure were the centerpiece of the approach, and dialogue has never been ruled out under any administration, observers say. After the briefing, some of the US senators also took issue with the absence of specifics on the Trump administration\u2019s thinking on North Korea and any potential future actions such as in response to a new nuclear test. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley told CNN he believed the White House\u2019s decision to arrange the meeting was for \u201coptics,\u201d while Republican Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d \u201cHaving dealt with the North Korean nuclear issues for more than 20 years, it\u2019s extremely difficult for anyone to come up with an entirely new yet sound approach at this point,\u201d an official at Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on customary condition of anonymity. \u201cBut under Trump, the level of pressure could be higher against both North Korea and China, as it\u2019s trying to put maximum pressure, and this could bring different actions and different results.\u201d In another development, a White House official said the US is considering putting North Korea back on the State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism.The US House of Representatives approved a bill calling for the redesignation early this month, and similar legislation has also been introduced at the Senate. Washington blacklisted the communist state in 1988 following its midair bombing of a Korean Air passenger plane, killing all 115 aboard, but lifted it in 2008 as part of six-nation nuclear negotiations. Any return to the list would make Pyongyang subject to further sanctions on trade, investment, assistance, financial transactions and other engagement with the US.After the release of the joint statement, South Korea\u2019s leading presidential candidates pledged to play a \u201cproactive role\u201d in resolving the nuclear standoff if they win the May 9 election. Front-runner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea expressed concerns that South Korea may be put on the back burner as the US and China dominate the discussions. \u201cIf things go as they do right now, we would only be confined to a spectator role,\u201d he said at a debate hosted by the broadcast journalists\u2019 association in Seoul on Thursday. \u201cWe need a step-by-step approach starting a moratorium on the nuclear programs, in which we should take the lead. The North has no reason to reject it if its system is protected through a peace treaty.\u201d Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party, No. 2 in presidential polls, stressed the significance of the Trump administration\u2019s attitude toward diplomacy, which he said would foster a \u201cpositive environment\u201d for South Korea to resolve the stalemate. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief that it could substantially ease our citizens\u2019 concerns over war,\u201d he wrote via his Facebook page. \u201cGiven its ownership in the peninsula issues, the next government should undertake a leading and active role as soon as it is inaugurated.\u201d Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry also issued a statement touting Washington\u2019s efforts, saying the latest move showed its determination to change Pyongyang\u2019s course and return to serious negotiations. \u201cThe joint statement reaffirms the US administration\u2019s clear resolve to take the North to the path of denuclearization through economic and diplomatic pressure,\u201d spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said at a regular news briefing Thursday. \u201cSouth Korea and the US maintain a consistent position on dialogue -- if North Korea takes the path to denuclearization with sincerity, the door for dialogue will open. We once again urge the North to realize that denuclearization is the only option it can choose, and come out to the path of change.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1384":"The South Korean military said Friday it will resume a crackdown on Chinese fishing boats illegally operating near the tension-high inter-Korean sea border in the West Sea.The operation to start this weekend comes at the outset of the peak crab-catching season.A Chinese fishing ship is caught by South Korea's Coast Guard for illegal operation in the West Sea in this file photo provided by the Coast Guard.

At times, patrol ships of the South's Coast Guard approach the NLL, trying to drive away unauthorized Chinese fishing vessels.The South's military carried out similar operations there last year in partnership with the Coast Guard and the UN Command during the crab-catching season.

(Yonhap)","1387":"Malaysia released the body of the slain half brother of North Korea's leader to the North, ending a diplomatic row between the two countries over Kim Jong-nam's death.\"Malaysia agreed to facilitate the transfer of the body to the family of the deceased in North Korea,\" according to a joint statement between North Korea and Malaysia carried by the Korean Central News Agency. Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late leader Kim Jong-il (Yonhap)The deceased refers to Kim Jong-nam, who was killed last month in Malaysia after two Asian women smeared the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent on his face.The agreement also called for lifting a travel ban imposed on citizens staying in each other's countries, the KCNA said.Under the deal, Kim's body as well as those of two North Korean diplomats suspected of involvement in the killing left Kuala Lumpur on a Malaysia Airlines Flight 360 Thursday afternoon and arrived in Beijing around 2 a.m. Friday. The North Korean diplomats were seen leaving the airport in a black limousine.The officials and Kim's body are expected to leave for Pyongyang on an Air Koryo flight as early as on Saturday.Malaysian police earlier said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the killing. North Korea claimed that Malaysia colluded with South Korea to manipulate the probe.North Korea imposed a temporary exit ban on Malaysians staying in the North, saying that the move will be effective until the row over his death is resolved. In a tit-for-tat action, Malaysia banned North Korean diplomats from leaving the country.\"This would allow the nine Malaysians presently in Pyongyang to return to Malaysia and (North Korean) citizens in Kuala Lumpur to depart Malaysia,\" the KCNA said.Both countries decided to patch up their frayed ties as they reaffirmed the importance of their relations which were established in 1973, it added.\"In this connection, both countries agreed to positively discuss the re-introduction of the visa-free system and work towards bringing the relations to a higher level,\" it said.Malaysia canceled its visa-waiver program with North Korea and kicked out North Korean Ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol in retaliation for North Korea's \"diplomatically rude\" remarks.Pyongyang claimed that the dead man is Kim Chol, the name on a passport held by Kim Jong-nam. It said that a North Korean citizen carrying a diplomatic passport fell into a state of \"shock,\" without making any references to his identity.Seoul has claimed that North Korea is behind the killing, saying that the North's leader has issued a standing order to kill his brother since he assumed power in 2011.Out of the eight North Korean suspects, four fled Malaysia on the day of Kim's death. Kim Jong-chol, who was earlier taken into custody, was released.Malaysian police have been looking for three suspects including a diplomat believed to be hiding at the North Korean Embassy in Malaysia. (Yonhap)","1388":"Foreign nationals perceived as prone to commit acts of terrorism and other crimes will be barred from boarding international flights bound for South Korea, starting next month, the government said Thursday.The Ministry of Justice said that an advance passenger identification system will formally take effect April 1 to prevent crime-prone foreigners from boarding South Korea-bound planes at overseas airports. (Yonhap)The system will be applied to all flights of 86 airliners that depart for South Korea from 169 airports in 43 countries, the ministry noted. The entry ban has so far been implemented selectively on a trial basis.Under the system, an airliner sends passenger information from departure airports to the ministry's Immigration Information System. Then the immigration authorities here give real-time feedback on whether to allow boarding for specific individuals after examining their records of involvement in terrorist attacks and previous refusals of entry and verifying their passports.Preparations for the system began in March 2014 after a Malaysia Airlines plane went missing and the first test run was carried out for an Asiana Airlines flight departing from Japan's Narita International Airport in February 2015.In the test operation, a total of 2,271 crime-prone foreigners, including those convicted of attempted murder, drug-related crimes and theft, as well as holders of stolen or lost passports, have not been allowed to enter South Korea.For instance, an Egyptian national convicted of attempted murder was barred from boarding a Cathay Pacific flight bound for South Korea at Hong Kong International Airport in October last year, while a Vietnamese national wanted by Interpol was not allowed to board a Korean Air plane in Hong Kong in January this year.\"The government will further strengthen border controls and contribute to national security by blocking entry to crime-prone foreigners,\" a ministry official said.

Roh Jae-cheon, a spokesman for the JCS, told reporters.The South's military does not rule out the possibility of the North pushing for a \"different type of nuclear test from the past,\" he added without elaborating.The North's military, he said, seems to be continuing its annual winter training but shows no \"unusual\" indications.A series of reports suggest that Pyongyang is edging closer to detonating a bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear site.In particular, fresh satellite imagery of the northeastern area shows up to 100 people gathered near the key facilities, according to the 38 North website carrying news on North Korea.It adds to the website's earlier reports of vehicles and communication equipment recently spotted at the site. North Korea watchers raise the possibility that the North will carry out a \"Pakistan-type\" test. Pakistan blasted six nuclear bombs all using different materials on May 28 and 30 in 1999 in an apparent to bid to collect data as comprehensive as possible.Satellite imagery shows North Korea's nuclear test site in a photo released by 38 North. (Yonhap)The North is also known to have a number of tunnels at the Punggy-ri site, which enable it to test several devices almost simultaneously.The sixth nuclear explosion by the North, if conducted, would aim to master the technology to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile and maximize an explosive yield, experts pointed out.\"North Korea claims that it has already miniaturized a nuclear bomb. Thus, there is a chance that it will test a boosted fission bomb,\" Lee Chun-geun, a researcher at the Science and Technology Policy Institute, said. \"It could be 150-200 kilotons.\"The force of each explosion in its previous tests in 2006, 2009, 2013 and twice last year reportedly stayed below 10 kilotons.Chances are high that the North will focus on testing a \"boosted fission\" weapon in the run-up to developing a hydrogen bomb, according to observers.On the timing of another nuclear test, they said it's possible within the coming weeks, given Pyongyang's record of using the provocation to commemorate major political events and draw international attention.US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping plan to hold summit talks in early April, with the 105th birth anniversary of the North's founder Kim Il-sung to follow on April 15.The Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, which is the nation's rubber-stamp parliament, also plans to hold a main session on April 11 ahead of the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army on April 25.

And that will make people happy,\" Choi said of the former party leader.Choi's defection follows earlier reports that Kim may soon announce his bid for presidency.Kim earlier vowed to play a \"role\" in forming an alliance of political parties and presidential hopefuls to field a single, unified candidate who can defeat frontrunner Moon in the upcoming election.\"Preparations for forming a coalition government require efforts to field an unified candidate. A coalition government will be possible only if we successfully complete the unification process. Without that, we cannot lead this country,\" he said earlier.Those close to the former lawmaker said Kim may declare his official bid as early as next week. Kim lost his proportional representative parliamentary seat automatically when he quit the Democratic Party.In apparent efforts to join forces with other presidential hopefuls, Kim has been holding a series of meetings with such figures, including former Prime Minister Chung Un-chan.Following their one-on-one meeting last week, the two met again earlier Wednesday in a three-way meeting that involved Hong Seok-hyun, another presidential prospect who resigned last week as chairman of major local daily JoongAng Ilbo.

According to data released by local pollster Realmeter on Monday, his support rating stood at 2.2 percent, far outrunning Nam\u2019s 1 percent.The Daegu lawmaker, who had once been one of the closest aides to former President Park, built up his reputation as a reformist conservative when he exited the ruling Saenuri Party -- the former body of the current Liberty Korea Party -- ahead of 2016 parliamentary election and won the race as an independent.He returned to his home party after the race but later defected once again amid the aftermath of Park\u2018s corruption scandal and impeachment to establish the splinter Bareun Party.Underlining such identity as \u201creasonable conservative,\u201d Yoo has been adopting a two-way policy strategy -- taking a conservative tone on national security and a progressive turn when it comes to welfare and other social issues.One of his representative campaign pledges as presidential aspirant is the \u201cmedium burden, medium welfare,\u201d an idea of raising the taxation rate to a reasonable level so as to improve the nation\u2019s welfare program.Meanwhile, the party\u2019s dilemma is that Yoo, despite his overwhelming support from within the party, still stands little chance against liberal front-runners.Speculations are thus rampant that he may end up forming a solidarity with the relatively centrist opposition People\u2019s Party or other independent figures.But Rep.

But they failed to narrow their differences on some important details, such as weekend pay rates and a grace period to be granted to businesses.Ha Tae-kyung, chairman of the Environment and Labor Committee, holds a meeting to discuss the amendment of the Labor Standards Law with its members at the National Assembly in Seoul, Monday. (Yonhap)The Labor Standards Act currently limits work to 52 hours a week -- 40 hours of regular work and 12 hours of overtime. But as the Labor Ministry has seen \u201cthe week\u201d as excluding Saturday and Sunday, the legal limit is stretched to 68 hours in reality -- 40 hours during weekdays, 12 hours of overtime and 16 hours during the weekend. The proposed revision was to plug this loophole by clearly stating in the law that the 52-hour cap is for the entire seven days of a week. According to 2015 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Koreans worked an average 2,113 hours annually, the third-longest hours among OECD countries. This marks 1.2 times more than the OECD bloc\u2019s average of 1,766 hours. On the other hand, labor productivity, measured as gross domestic product per hour worked, was far lower than the OECD average of $46.6, standing at $31.80 in 2015. The push to curtail long hours and move to a more efficient work culture has faced strong resistance from local businesses, which fear that a rise in labor costs would chip away at their competitiveness in the global market. Mindful of the worries, pro-business lawmakers of the parliamentary committee had insisted on granting companies up to two to four years of grace period.\u00a0Liberal lawmakers as well as labor unions, however, have strongly opposed the grace period for businesses, saying it is only an excuse for employers to break a law and further exploit workers.

The search could begin April 10 after workers complete disinfecting the ship, the ministry said.At the same time, an eight-member fact-finding body will launch a probe to determine the exact cause of the tragedy.Also, the ministry said a search for any bodies left in the water and on the sea floor, where the Sewol sank, will commence in early April. The project to pull the ferry out of the water intact was aimed at recovering the bodies of the people still missing and conducting a detailed investigation into the disaster.The South Korean government decided to push forward with the 85.1 billion-won ($72 million) project in 2015, with the Chinese consortium led by the state-run Shanghai Salvage winning the bid.

Google is one of the sponsors of the institute.The report suggests that news organizations and publishers across the world are facing unprecedented levels of disruption to business models and formats from a combination of more social platforms and general moves toward mobile devices.\"In South Korea, the media is characterized by strong broadcasters, a newspaper sector struggling to adapt to digital change, along with powerful Korean-owned online portals, social networks and messaging applications,\" according to the report. \"Forty-four percent of the respondents in 26 countries said they use Facebook as a source of news,\" he said, adding that more and more people use platforms, such as social media, than go directly to websites of news organizations or media outlets.\"But it is different in (South) Korea as Facebook dominates 24 percent, while Kakao Talk dominates 22 percent,\" he said. Kakao Talk is the country's most popular mobile messenger with 38 million users out of a 51 million population.Nielsen also highlighted that South Korea is unique in the way people check news.\"Compared with other markets, South Korea is a developed market in which searches are significantly more important than in other countries,\" he said.More than 60 percent of the respondents in South Korea said they used \"searches\" to come across news stories, compared with 30 percent in the U.S. and 38 percent in Japan. \"On-year growth of using smartphones to check the news shows no signs of slowing down,\" according to the report. \"Smartphone news access is higher than computer access in South Korea, Switzerland and Sweden.\"The expert said South Korea, one of the most mobile-centered markets, is clearly leading the market in terms of smartphone usage.In South Korea, 48 percent of the respondents said they use smartphones as the main device to access news, followed by 41 percent for computers and tablets accounting for only 4 percent.He also cited the rise of platforms is not only a challenge but also can serve as an opportunity for news organizations.\"Media organizations have to face that their revenues will be smaller than in the 1990s.

The Sino-US rivalry would continue to intensify across the region, yet this time the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Moscow is expected to act as a major variable. With an early presidential election looming, the alliance between Seoul and Washington could be put to the test if the next South Korean leader moves to shelve their joint decision to deploy a US missile shield here, which triggered China\u2019s stern protest. After years of impasse, South Korea and Japan had been mending their fences since their settlement on the comfort women dispute in December 2015. But uncertainties remain given the unbridled political and public backlash over the deal, as well as a recently inked military intelligence-sharing pact. Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, picked uncertainty, obscurity and instability as three keywords to drive the regional diplomatic and security landscape this year, with Trump being a top policy factor.\u00a0 South Korean citizens on Sunday watch North Korean leader Kim Jong-un make a speech on TV at Seoul Station. (Yonhap)\u201cUnder (President Barack) Obama, the Sino-US relationship was about a mix of cooperation and competition. Now competition and conflict are most likely to deepen across the board, from trade to security, which will have an impact throughout Northeast Asia,\u201d he said at a recent seminar in Seoul.\u201cIn contrast, the US-Russia relations would improve substantially, which may result in a whole new triangle. This could possibly be helpful for Seoul to some extent, as Russia\u2019s clout grows and limits China\u2019s somewhat excessive influence in the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Trump factor In the wake of Trump\u2019s win and Brexit, the current international trends of anti-globalization and nationalism alike will likely last for the time being. This has prompted leaders around the world to put more priority on domestic economy, trade and military spending than alliances and multinational partnerships. On the campaign trail, the real estate magnet demanded Seoul, Tokyo and other US allies shoulder greater defense costs. He also labeled a South Korea-US free trade agreement a \u201cjob killer,\u201d while accusing China of stealing US factories and manipulating currency, among others. Trump\u2019s focus on domestic issues and de facto departure from Obama\u2019s rebalance to Asia may come as something of a relief to Beijing, which sees Washington\u2019s alliance-building and military encirclement as a tactic to contain its rise. The incoming administration, however, will likely continue to intensify its efforts to keep China in check, this time in partnership with Russia, as Henry Kissinger told then-President Richard Nixon ahead of his 1972 historic trip to Beijing as his national security adviser. \u201cAt this point, the future direction of the Trump administration\u2019s China policy is uncertain,\u201d Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, said in an analysis. \u201cIt will be focused on economy and trade, but in line with the aforementioned policy of \u2018peace through strength,\u2019 Trump might pressure China to a great extent in the security context as well.\u201d Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has already sent mixed signals. Shortly before his election victory, he broke a decadesold custom by accepting a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, to the wrath of Beijing that cherishes the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. A week later he named Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, whose ties with President Xi Jinping date back to the 1980s, as the ambassador to China. Beijing welcomed it, hailing him as an \u201cold friend of the Chinese people.\u201d Then again, Trump tapped Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine economist and vocal China critic, to head a new White House team in charge of trade and industry. Xi, meanwhile, may respond to outside pressure with a hardline approach amid a slowing economy, especially as he seeks to consolidate his leadership at a major party congress in September by elevating allies to key posts. In Seoul, concerns are rising that the North Korea nuclear issue could be put on the back burner if the Sino-US standoff escalates over trade, currency and the South China Sea. Evolving NK threats Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are set to pick up pace. With five underground blasts and six long-range rocket launches, the communist state is deemed to be inching closer to master the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile topped with an atomic warhead, capable of striking the US mainland. In his New Year address on Sunday, leader Kim Jong-un said his country was in the \u201cclosing phase\u201d of preparations for an ICBM test. Pyongyang made a \u201cgroundbreaking breakthrough\u201d from a series of experiments last year and will steadily boost its capabilities for a \u201cpre-emptive nuclear attack\u201d unless South Korea and the US halt joint military drills, he warned. His threat is in line with the remarks by Thae Yong-ho, who was the North\u2019s No. 2 official at its embassy in London until his arrival in the South last summer. The former diplomat said at a news conference last week that the regime aims to complete the nuclear development by the end of 2017, targeting leadership transitions in Seoul and Washington.\u201cAny friction between dominant powers or chaos in the existing world order poses both opportunities and challenges to North Korea in terms of reinforcing its strategic leverage, but in general it\u2019s helpful,\u201d said Cha Du-hyun, special foreign policy adviser to Gyeonggi Province Governor and a former fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis. \u201cTo show everything it has and secure an edge in a future potential compromise, the North may stage an unprecedented level of provocation before or shortly after Trump is sworn in, such as a high-altitude test of electromagnetic pulse bombs coupled with a nuclear-tipped missile, or a new, greater-scale underground detonation.\u201d As for Pyongyang, Trump is forecast to stay tough, surrounded by hardline, retired military commanders as his top foreign policy and security aides. He has criticized Kim\u2019s nuclear ambition, calling him a \u201cmaniac,\u201d though he displayed his willingness to meet the young ruler. A warmer relationship between Washington and Moscow could provide fresh momentum for the nuclear stalemate, experts say. Yet Seoul may face a dilemma as China may loosen its implementation of international sanctions or resist further tightening them in the event of another provocation by the North in protest against mounting US pressure. Another possibility is a fresh peace offensive from Pyongyang. If the Kim regime conducts a successful ICBM test, it could declare a moratorium on additional nuclear and missile tests and offer to return to denuclearization negotiations alongside peace treaty talks, as Thae indicated. \u201cThe Trump administration may attempt dialogue with North Korea at its early stage. But if the North continues to demand its acceptance as a nuclear state, it will likely further strengthen sanctions and pressure,\u201d said Lee Dae-woo, a researcher at the Sejong Institute. \u201cEven if the nuclear negotiations reopen, the US is likely to demand an intensive inspection on the North Korean facilities, given Trump\u2019s criticism on the Iran deal and opposition to \u2018declaratory talks.\u2019\u201dPresidential election in Seoul Whether President Park Geun-hye is impeached or not, South Korea will elect a new leader in 2017. Last year\u2019s political turmoil kindled by a presidential scandal complicated the prospects for the race, with no clear front-runner in the offing. The next president will face a mountain of foreign policy and security challenges that determine the country\u2019s relations with critical partners in the region and beyond. As Trump suggested, for instance, he or she will have to tackle a possible renegotiation of the FTA and fend off calls for a sharp increase in Seoul\u2019s defense spending.At greater stake is the plan to station the US\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here, slated for this summer, and the December 2015 settlement on wartime sex slavery with Japan. Not only opposition bigwigs but some conservative presidential aspirants label the initiatives as Park\u2019s legacy, vowing to upend or renegotiate them in the new government. Asan\u2019s Choi singled out the THAAD plan as the \u201cfirst issue to be put to the test\u201d by the Seoul-Washington ties over the next several years. China, which considers the weapon to be directed at it, has been ratcheting up pressure on Seoul with economic retaliatory steps since the allies\u2019 announcement early last year. The comfort women accord brought a turnaround in the checkered relationship between South Korea and Japan following years of bitter spats. Yet it instantly sparked heated backlash from the public and the opposition due to the government\u2019s failure to consult in advance with the victims and a controversial clause that implies a removal of a girl statue erected in front of the Japanese Embassy here to honor the women. Leading Japanese policymakers and politicians, meanwhile, continued to deny or downplay the wartime atrocities. Last Thursday, the defense minister visited the Yasukuni war shrine criticized for whitewashing the country\u2019s imperial past. Then on Friday, Tokyo lodged a complaint as a civic group launched another girl statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan, two days after a local district office unilaterally took it down, prompting residents\u2019 uproar. \u201cA volatile global economy, the new US administration\u2019s murky Asia Pacific strategy and the North Korea issue alike are factors that can bring South Korea and Japan closer,\u201d KNDA professor Cho Yang-hyun wrote in a 2017 outlook published by the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. \u201cBut amid the impeachment campaign, the leadership vacuum and weakening grip on external relations raised calls for a revamp in Japan policy. If the comfort women deal and military intelligence-sharing pact become a major political issue, the possibility can\u2019t be ruled out that the bilateral ties could turn confrontational.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1404":"It has been 30 years since South Korea became a democracy in 1987, ending decades of military dictatorship that had focused on defending against communist North Korea during the Cold War and spearheading the country\u2019s economic rise.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the past three decades, the country has seen the peaceful transition of power from one administration to the next.

Calls for Constitutional amendment are ripe, as the Park fiasco presents to the country a new challenge to build a more resilient democracy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marking the 30th year since the 1987 democratic uprising, The Korea Herald interviewed eight prominent leaders at the center of the transitional period who shared their insights on how to build a new governance system for the new era.Following are the excerpts from the Korea Herald\u2019s interview of eight prominent figures in politics, officialdom and academia. \u2013 Ed.\u00a0KH: It has been 30 years since South Korea enacted the current Constitution, completing its transition to democracy. What are the successes and failures of the past three decades and what changes are needed? Former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik: The 1987 system was successful in preventing dictatorship and allowing the people to elect their presidents by themselves. But problems emerged over time. Presidents have often abused their power to achieve their short-term goals within their single, five-year term. The power structure needs to be fixed, so that presidents can manage state affairs with a longer-term vision.\u00a0In my view, we should stick to the presidential system but should allow presidents to stand for re-election once. Plus, we should build a more sophisticated system of checks and balances to prevent the abuse of presidential powers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Former National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa: It is true that the 1987 Constitution was significant progress for South Korea, but I feel that now the 30-year-old system has become the root cause of many problems we face. Only a few people dominate power under the winner-takes-all election system. There is no middle ground.Such a system creates a hostile political climate. Politicians and their parties are more likely to fight each other than to find common ground. I think we are in a transitional period. We need to move beyond the 1987 system.\u00a0Former National Assembly Speaker Park Kwan-young: Every president elected since 1987 was embroiled in political scandals near the end of their term. This is because the presidents dominate (the government) and abuse their power. We need to find a way to reduce presidential powers. I think a semi-presidential system in which the presidents focus on external affairs and prime ministers deal with internal affairs would be best for Korea. Former National Assembly Speaker Kim Won-ki: The 1987 system brought an end to an authoritarian era that had persisted since the Cold War. Since 1987, there have been no presidents seeking to extend their term beyond the limit stated by the Constitution.\u00a0But focusing too much on preventing a dictatorship, we neglected other values crucial to managing democracies, like how to run political parties. It seems to me there is a broad agreement that the 1987 system needs to be changed. Former National Assembly Speaker Lim Chae-jung: The 1987 system\u2019s most significant achievement was to end dictatorship and build democracy -- albeit in a procedural sense. As a result, people are able to change their presidents every five years.\u00a0But we have failed to build upon the system and many problems have emerged afterward. Even the basic right was not fully protected under the 1987 Constitution. I think it has failed to catch up with the change of time and is now losing its value as the basic law.\u00a0However, we have to be cautious about revising the Constitution, because some politicians and parties approach the issue from (the perspective of) their own partisan interests.\u00a0 Professor emeritus of Kyung Hee University Huh Young: The 1987 Constitution wasn\u2019t a perfect one, but it has worked quite well until now. If we think there is a problem, it is more to do with how we managed the system rather than what the system is about.\u00a0When the people overthrew the military dictatorship in 1987, they focused on two things. First, they wanted to elect their presidents by themselves. Second, the presidents had to be limited to a single term to prevent dictatorship.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But things have changed so much since then. In 1987, we still lived in a conventional society, but now we are going through the internet and digital revolution. It is natural for the people to demand a different system for a changed society.\u00a0I think there is enough consensus among the public since President Park\u2019s scandal.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the government type, I think the presidential system suits Korea most because of the security challenges facing Korea. We need a strong leader. But the current single-term five-year presidency should be adjusted. I think a two-term four-year presidency is more ideal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Former Environment Minister Yoon Yeo-joon: The 1987 Constitution was a reflection of the people\u2019s consensus during turbulent times of the 1980s, which was electing presidents by themselves. But other than that, the 1987 system was a little bit slipshod. It needs to be fixed. Senior People\u2019s Party adviser Chung Dae-chul: The 1987 system was a call from the people for democracy and it has persisted for 30 years. Now the people want it to be changed. They want to change the way their presidents use power. KH: Since the presidential scandal erupted in October, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the street to demand her resignation. What is your take on the protests and what they mean for Korean democracy?\u00a0 Prime Minister Kim: I understand that the people had no choice but to take to the streets. The scandal showed that Korea\u2019s representative democracy did not work at all under the rule of President Park.\u00a0Maybe the candlelight protests could help strengthen democracy, but it can\u2019t provide an alternative to representative democracy. We need to solve the problem by incorporating the people\u2019s ideas into the political process under representative democracy. Speaker Kim: The candlelight protest will be a watershed moment in South Korea\u2019s history. It will have a profound impact not just on politics but on society as a whole. It could be a driving force behind efforts to make Korea a better country.\u00a0But it is up to the politicians to channel this energy into national reform. The protests were an opportunity for people to nurture a sense of justice and courage to stand up against wrongful authorities. I hope politicians realize what would happen if they fail to do their jobs.\u00a0 Huh: The public sentiment shown during the protest is something that we can watch and experience. Such an \u201cempirical experience\u201d is a piece of information that policymakers can use, but not all or an overriding and deciding factor in mapping out a strategy to run the government.\u00a0We should regard equally the opinions of those who do not show up at street protests. There are two types of public opinions -- one of the protestors and the other from a more silent group. I think the latter is closer to what the people as a whole think.\u00a0One of the problems in South Korean politics is that it gives too much weight to empirical experiences like massive protests and opinion polls. But they will change over time. It is wrong to allow them to influence policies too much. I don\u2019t think it would happen in other advanced democracies. Senior adviser Chung: I have a positive view of the candlelight protests. It is a new form of direct public participation in the political process KH: President Park\u2019s scandal brought about a leadership crisis, damaging the public\u2019s confidence in the way the country is run. Do you think Park is solely to blame, or had structural factors played into the current leadership crisis?\u00a0\u00a0  Yoon: It is self-evident if you just watch what is happening. If you are in a position to lead the country, you should have leadership skills. I think we elected a president who doesn\u2019t have the ability to lead.\u00a0\u00a0 Assembly Speaker Kim: The current leadership crisis is an unprecedented one. But then again, leaders in South Korea have confronted a similar crisis. Though Park\u2019s scandal is much more serious than others, most presidents barely gained the trust of the public.The current crisis is also linked to our political system. True, political leadership has to do with the individual traits of the leaders. But, more often than not, it has more to do with the established system, as well.Prime Minister Kim: President Park is the primary reason behind the current crisis. She has allowed unauthorized individuals to meddle in state affairs and neglected her duty to oversee them. Thus, Park is the first one to be held accountable. Then again, her predecessors have suffered from similar nepotism scandals. Presidents have often wielded exclusive power, but there is little method available for us to limit their power abuse.\u00a0 Senior adviser Chung: I don\u2019t agree with the notion that links the current political turmoil to the failures of the country\u2019s political establishment. What we are seeing is an isolated case of President Park Geun-hye herself. She violated the Constitution and lacked the ability to lead. This is why she was impeached.Assembly Speaker Chung: Both are to blame. President Park herself has managed the country in a wrongful manner and failed to do what is required of a leader. A dysfunctional political system has also played a part. Under the single-term presidency and single-member constituency system, political parties are prone to partisan standoffs and fractional infighting. It creates a political culture where the winner takes all. There is no middle ground. Lim: Both are to blame. One thing I want to highlight is that we are beginning to see our history bounce back from the legacy of Park Chung-hee, a military dictator and the father of the current President Park Geun-hye.\u00a0The way that President Park Geun-hye\u2019s office worked is exactly the same as her father\u2019s did. It was something that we didn\u2019t expect to see again after the demise of Park Chung-hee. In that regard, I think we are living through the final chapter of Park Chung-hee legacy.KH: After President Park\u2019s fall, politicians are talking about what kind of leader that the country needs. Some say \u201ccohesive\u201d leaders are needed while others advocate \u201creformative\u201d ones. What is your take on this?Prime Minister Kim: I believe that the next leader should be \u201ccohesive,\u201d embracing diverse parts of society through compromise and negotiation.\u00a0It does not clash with reformative leadership. Compromise and negotiations make it easier for us to pursue reform. It is not an either A or B issue. Based on bringing together the people\u2019s opinions, we can find a way to overhaul society. Lim: I think we need reformative leadership. For example, the Constitution cannot fulfill the demands presented by the new era. Now is the time to open up ourselves and reach consensus over what sort of values a new Constitution should represent. Huh: If I had to choose between the two, I would definitely go for cohesive leadership. We cannot achieve social reform without bringing together the people\u2019s opinions. If we simply push for reform, protests will re-emerge.\u00a0Therefore, bringing together the people must come first before pushing for reform. Leaders can achieve their reform after reaching out to the people and building consensus among them. Reform can serve its purpose only when it succeeds. Simply pursuing reform cannot be our goal.\u00a0 Yoon: Whether it is cohesive or reformative, what is more crucial is the person\u2019s ability to lead the country. We need a leader who comprehends how a true democracy works and has internalized democratize values and rules.\u00a0 By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","1405":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Sunday claimed his country was in the \u201cclosing phase\u201d of preparations for an intercontinental ballistic missiles test, raising the possibility for a major provocation in time for government changes in Seoul and Washington. In his live New Year address, the young ruler said the country made a \u201cgroundbreaking breakthrough\u201d from a series of nuclear and missile tests last year, threatening to beef up its capabilities for a \u201cpreemptive nuclear attack\u201d unless South Korea and the US halt joint war exercises.\u00a0 Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)\u201cTo cope with the imperialists\u2019 increasingly atrocious threats of a nuclear war, our first test of a hydrogen bomb, test-firing of various means of attack and test-explosions of nuclear warheads were conducted successfully,\u201d Kim said via the official Korean Central Television. \u201cAnd also with active research and development projects on cutting-edge arms and equipment, the preparations for the test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic rocket have reached a closing phase.\u201d His remarks boosted speculation the communist state may test the KN-08 ICBM, thought to be capable of flying up to 13,000 kilometers.\u00a0 North Korea (Yonhap)Pyongyang unveiled the weapon during a military parade in October 2015 marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, touting it as a \u201cstrategic rocket equipped with varied, miniaturized nuclear warheads.\u201d Last March, state media released an image of Kim inspecting what it claimed to be a miniaturized fission device on display alongside the KN-08. Debate has been fierce over the North\u2019s ICBM progress. Washington\u2019s Defense Department has said it is already being deployed and capable of hitting the US mainland, whereas Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry remains skeptical given a lack of test launches and other evidence. Thae Yong-ho, who was the North\u2019s No. 2 man at its embassy in London until his defection to the South last summer, said last week that the country aims to complete the nuclear development by the end of 2017 to coincide with the leadership transitions in Seoul and Washington. Kim, who took power in December 2011, has delivered his New Year speech since 2013 and state media began live broadcast last year. This year\u2019s message came ahead of the swearing-in of Donald Trump as the US president. He has yet to unveil his North Korea policy framework but expressed his willingness to meet Kim during the campaign period. But Kim fell short of directly referring to Trump, simply repeating Pyongyang\u2019s long-festering demand for an end to the joint military drills and what it calls hostile policy. Kim stressed the need to invent more of \u201cour own, self-reliant weapons,\u201d indicating the sustained building of a submarine launched ballistic missile, cyber and other asymmetrical warfare capabilities. \u201cThe US must look squarely at the Korean people\u2019s resolve for a unification, no longer stick to alienation plots to instigate a war with the anti-unification forces in the South, and make a resolute decision to withdraw the anachronistic hostile policy (toward the North),\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as the US and its follower forces\u2019 nuclear threats and blackmail last, and as long as they remove what they call \u2018regular\u2019 war exercise fuss, we will continue to strengthen our self-defensive and preemptive strike capabilities centering on nuclear power.\u201d As for Seoul, he mentioned President Park Geun-hye by name, denouncing her as \u201canti-unification and a traitor\u201d whose ruling foundations were \u201cshaken from the root because of a robust public anti-government fight.\u201d \u201cLast year\u2019s nationwide struggle, which left a trail in the history of the southern people\u2019s struggles, was an explosion of grudges and anger deeply built toward the conservative government that had been engaged in fascist rule, anti-people policy, toadyism, selling the nation and fratricidal confrontation,\u201d Kim said.

Though confusion exists on whether a suspended president is also subject to such an exemption, it is being widely speculated that Park will not show up during the impeachment trial process.Observers point out that the Constitutional Court, whose main function is to judge the constitutional conformity of laws and administrative measures, will rush through the normative process once the fact-finding is done.But the problem is that Park has been refuting all of the circumstances the National Assembly listed in the impeachment statement, much in contrast to her predecessor in impeachment, former President Roh Moo-hyun.The late liberal president, when facing his impeachment trial in 2004 over an alleged breach of political neutrality, acknowledged the facts listed in his impeachment resolution, allowing the court to jump to its normative judgment.Since the Choi scandal broke out in late October last year, President Park has delivered three official addresses to the nation, in which she mostly claimed innocence over Choi\u2019s alleged influence-peddling acts. In an unheralded press meeting held recently on New Year\u2019s Day, she once again complained of injustice and denied the charges, especially her involvement in the alleged bribery allegations.Considering such circumstances, it is highly likely that Park\u2019s legal team will continue to raise doubts on the credibility of the evidence submitted by prosecutors and lawmakers, as well as that of the written testimonies that are unfavorable for Park.Should the plaintiff -- the parliamentary impeachment committee -- and the defendant plunge into a lengthy cross-examination process on each other\u2019s key witnesses, the court ruling will inevitably face a delay, which will in turn put off the timeline for the next presidential election.The deadline for the Constitutional Court to finalize its stance on impeachment is six months from the submission of the resolution, which will be in early June. The top court, however, has been hinting at speeding up its process, so as to minimize the vacuum in state affairs.\u00a0The process for the late Roh took about two months.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1416":"South Korea plans to launch a full-fledged investigation into North Korea's human rights abuses starting next week by holding one-on-one interviews with incoming defectors, a government official said Thursday.\u00a0A new agency tasked with documenting North Korea's human rights plans to conduct interviews with all North Korean defectors who will enter two resettlement education facilities in January, from Monday until Jan. 16, according to the official.\u00a0Seoul launched the Center for North Korean Human Rights Records in late September to investigate and collect data on Pyongyang's human rights violations in accordance with a new law aimed at improving Pyongyang's dismal treatment of its people.\u00a0\"The results of the probe will be used as basic data in crafting the government's relevant policy and evidence for the future that can be used to hold violators responsible for their crimes,\" said the official, asking not to be named.\u00a0The official said that the center plans to make mug shots of human rights perpetrators in cooperation with the country's policy agency, based on accounts from defectors. But it will not make public a list of violators' names or their photos, he added.\u00a0The questionnaire to be used in the interviews consists of about 140 questions covering defectors' direct or indirect experience with human rights violations including public executions, forced repatriation and life in prison camps.\u00a0Prior to the planned interviews, the agency conducted a pilot survey on 116 North Korean defectors at the Hanawon facility in Anseong, south of Seoul, in December.\u00a0The agency compiled 130 specific cases of rights abuses through the preliminary probe, he said.\u00a0\"The fact that we will investigate and document human rights violations will serve as pressure on North Korea,\" the official said. \"We plan to publish an annual report on North Korea's rights abuses based on the probe.\"\u00a0North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world.

(Yonhap)","1418":"Japan doesn't seem to take issue with South Korea's acting president possibly joining a summit of three Asian neighbors that could happen early this year, a senior foreign ministry official said Wednesday.Japan is seeking to hold the trilateral summit involving leaders from China and South Korea with some local media reporting that it has proposed the meeting to be held around Feb. 10.As the timetable seems to be shaping up, critics here are worrying that it might not be appropriate for South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to join the gathering. Hwang has been serving as acting president since Dec. 9 when the parliament voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye over her alleged involvement in a influence-peddling scandal. \"I understand that Japan does not have any problem (with Hwang's capacity as acting president) given that it keeps proposing dates for the meeting,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hyong-zhin told reporters.Kim declined to confirm the exact dates that Tokyo has proposed, nor did he elaborate on whether South Korea has accepted any timetable. He still noted that the Seoul government wants to maintain the trilateral summit channels.The three nations had taken turns hosting the summit since 2008 to promote cooperation. The meeting was put on hold for more than three years as Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation irked Seoul and Beijing. Talks were resumed in 2015. Japan pushed to hold the summit late last year but it was postponed due in part to China's lukewarm stance and the political turmoil in South Korea caused by the impeachment.

It also launched around 20 ballistic missiles in 2016 including the intermediate-range Musudan and those launched from a submarine.The United Nations Security Council slapped tough sanctions on the North twice for its nuclear tests in January and September.Thae Yong-ho, a high-profile North Korean defector and former ranking diplomat, said last week that the North's leader is determined to complete the development of nuclear weapons by the end of 2017.Last year, inter-Korean ties fell to one of the lowest points due to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations.In February, Seoul shut down a joint industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong, ending the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.The government said that North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons should take precedence if the two Koreas are to hold meaningful dialogue.\"North Korea does not seem to have an interest in denuclearization, as Kim's New Year message showed. At the current stage, we are not considering proposing dialogue to the North,\" Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told reporters. Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo (Yonhap)Kim Nam-jung, the head of the ministry's unification policy office, said that resuming the complex would not be easy, given the UN sanctions imposed on North Korea last year.\"There may be many limitations (in resuming the Kaesong Industrial Complex). It is hard to gauge the current situation at the factory zone, but it is believed that there are no signs that North Korea moves equipment out of the complex.\"The ministry, meanwhile, said that it seeks to allow civic groups to provide humanitarian assistance to socially vulnerable people in North Korea, including infants, after taking into account various factors such as necessity and urgency.Seoul has suspended almost all civilian inter-Korean exchanges and South Koreans' visits to North Korea since Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test in January 2016.

It also has a table showing the amount of coal that individual companies buy from the North both monthly and annually.A screenshot of the United Nations Security Council website featuring procurement of DPRK coal by member states\"This website is updated in real time upon receipt of reports by member states,\" it explained.The addition is in line with a new set of sanctions that the UNSC adopted late last year following the North's nuclear test in September.The centerpiece of the sanctions is significantly curtailing North Korea's coal exports -- its single biggest export item and source of hard currency -- by putting a cap on the total amount even if exports are for \"livelihood\" purposes.The cap was set at whichever is lower between 7.5 million tons or $400 million. The government expects that it could cut the North's annual coal export revenue by more than 60 percent or about $700 million.As part of efforts to better enforce the restriction, the resolution asks member states to submit data on their imports of the North's coal every month to the sanctions committee, which is required to post it on its website.

(AP)","1424":"North Korea\u2019s submarine-launched ballistic missile could strike the entirety of South Korea when armed with a 1-ton nuclear warhead, foreign missile experts said recently.The claim was made in a report, titled the \u201cNorth Korean Ballistic Missile Program,\u201d released in the December edition of the Korea Observer published by the Institute of Korean Studies (IKS).Theodore A. Postol, an emeritus professor at MIT, and Markus Schiller, an aerospace engineer at Munich-based ST Analytics, said there are many uncertainties in our current knowledge of the KN-11 system, but there is enough known to provide at least a lower bound estimate of its capabilities. The KN-11 SLBM is capable of carrying a 1.5-ton warhead nearly 450 kilometers or a 1-ton warhead to 600 km or more. It could have a range of 800 km with a 1-ton warhead though more details are necessary to finalize the maximum range of the long-range missile, the IKS report said.\u00a0 \u201cThis means that when the KN-11 is eventually deployed on diesel-electric submarines, it will almost certainly have the payload and range to carry a heavy first-generation nuclear warhead designed for ballistic missile delivery from large areas of ocean,\u201d it said.Missile defenses like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense that are designed to intercept incoming missiles from a relatively well-defined direction will not be able to readily engage such an \u201call azimuth\u201d SLBM, the experts said.North Korea successfully conducted an SLBM test in August, sending the missile some 500 kilometers over the East Sea, the greatest distance the communist nation has achieved since it began SLBM tests last year. Two other tests were conducted in April and July that ended in failure.In a separate paper titled \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s Stockpiles of Fissile Material,\u201d Siegfried S. Hecker, a senior fellow at the Center of International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, said the North is rapidly increasing the size and sophistication of its nuclear arsenal after conducting five nuclear tests in the past decade. \u201cIncreased sophistication, particularly the ability to miniaturize nuclear devices, requires more nuclear tests. The size of the arsenal is limited primarily by the stockpile of fissile material -- plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEC),\u201d Hecker said. Pyongyang currently holds 20-40 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, sufficient for the manufacture of four to eight plutonium bombs. It is expected to have an additional 6 kg of plutonium each year, he said.
