Vincent K. Brooks -- commander of United States Forces Korea, Combined Forces Command and United Nations Command -- was bestowed a Korean name last week at a ceremony in a show of appreciation for his commitment to strengthening fraternity between the defense forces of the US and Korea. At the venue Friday organized by the ROK-US Alliance Friendship Association, the top commander was given a plaque and a scroll displaying his new name: \u201cPark Yu-jong.\u201d The last name \u201cPark\u201d comes from Park Je-ga (1750-1805), a renowned Joseon era (1392-1897) scholar of realist Confucianism, while his first name symbolizes a person capable of making virtuous connections as well as competently leading others, according to the USFK public affairs office. Gen. Brooks was also awarded an honorary taekwondo black belt.\u00a0USFK Commander Gen. Vincent Brooks (right) is bestowed his Korean name \u201cPark Yu-jong\u201d on a scroll at a ceremony that was organized by the ROK-US Alliance Friendship Association on Friday. (ROK-US Alliance Friendship Association)The general said at the venue he was \u201cdeeply humbled to be granted a Korean name\u201d and the bestowal was \u201csymbolic of the deep connection between Korea and the United States.\u201d He added that the endowment of the honorary black belt was a reminder of the Korean people\u2019s generosity. Korean names have been previously conferred to former commanders of the USFK, 7th Air Force, 8th United States Army and other top American government officials, including US President Barack Obama and former US Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. Obama was named \u201cO Han-ma,\u201d Gates \u201cGe Eui-chi,\u201d current US presidential Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton \u201cHan Hee-sook\u201d and former US Ambassador to Korea Alexander R. Vershbow \u201cPark Bo-woo,\u201d among others. The four-star general, who assumed his current post in March, succeeded Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is now Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO Allied Command Operations as well as commander of the United States European Command. Brooks previously served as the commanding general of the United States Army Pacific and Third Army, and was the US Army\u2019s Deputy Director of Operations during the war in Iraq. He graduated from the West Point United States Military Academy in 1980 as the school\u2019s first African-American Cadet First Captain, the highest position a cadet can hold as cadet brigade commander. As part of President Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d foreign policy directed at bolstering alliances with Asian countries, Brooks has reportedly envisioned an initiative called \u201cPacific Pathways,\u201d which would rotate a single US Army unit on different deployments across Asia, enabling them to more speedily address humanitarian crises and security threats.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","1":"A local research team said Monday it found a record of the Japanese military killing Korean women forced to serve as sex slaves when the country was under colonial rule (1910-45).The operation diary for Sept. 15, 1944, recorded by allied forces of the United States and China, says \"Night of the (Sept.) 13th, (1944), the Japs shot 30 Korean girls in the city (of Tengchong, China),\" according to the Seoul National University (SNU) Human Rights Center. This scanned document provided by the Seoul National University (SNU) Human Rights Center on Nov. 7, 2016, shows a record of the Japanese military's massacre of Koreans who were sexually enslaved during its colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45. (Yonhap)The record was discovered at the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland, during the research team's monthlong field study from mid-July to August.Words such as \"whores,\" \"comfort women\" and \"prostitutes\" were used throughout other relevant records, indicating the 30 women mentioned in the page were former sex slaves, said professor Kang Sung-hyun, a member of the research team.The existence of this record was already revealed to the public in the 1990s, but the latest finding was the first time the exact institution holding the document has been identified, said the professor at the Institute for East Asian Studies under Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.\"Our team has been delving into finding official documents on the comfort women issue since 2013 and we finally discovered over a dozen documents this year,\" he said. \"The outstanding feature of this operation diary, in particular, is that it is written in active voice, clearly stating who killed (the victims). It was the Japanese military.\"The finding was first presented to the public during an academic workshop held at SNU in southern Seoul on Friday.\"We discovered a total of 113 documents, including 14 on the Japanese military's massacre of sex slaves, this year,\" the professor told Yonhap News Agency. \"We are planning to issue a source book next year based on what we have found so far.\"Japan has paid 1 billion yen (US$9.69 million) to a South Korean foundation aimed at helping the victims under a deal reached between the two countries in December. Many South Korean victims, however, still oppose the agreement, saying it lacks Japan's acknowledgment of any legal responsibility.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II. The issue is increasingly urgent, as most of the surviving South Korean victims are in their late 80s. (Yonhap)","2":"Police have caught 477 people running clinics without proper qualifications in a recent clampdown on medial malpractices, the National Police Agency announced Monday. Between August and October, authorities came across 707 cases of illegal activities in medical and pharmaceutical industries here. A total of 1,693 people were nabbed, with 20 arrested as of November. Compared to the previous crackdown, conducted from January to July this year, the number of illegal cases rose by 514, with 1.75 times more people involved.\u00a0\u00a0According to police, 477 people (28.2 percent) of the illegal activities involved doctors or practitioners without proper qualifications, followed by 323 people (19.1 percent) who illegally requested or claimed treatment bills or pharmacy fees.Also, 228 people (13.4 percent) were caught illegally manufacturing and selling medicines while 47 people (2.8 percent) were found to have received kickbacks from industry insiders. Police said they would continue to clamp down on illegal activities in the medical and pharmaceutical industries by operating a year-round task force, as well as by cooperating with regional health centers and related health authorities.(ddd@heraldcorp.com)","3":"The latest European Union statistics have proved that the rumors that North Korea has significantly reduced sending its nationals to foreign countries are true, following a series of defections by North Koreans staying overseas in recent years.According to the recent Eurostat report on residence permits issued to non-EU citizens, the number of North Koreans who received first residence permits from 28 EU member nations, stood at 343 last year. Residence permits issued by an EU member state allow holders to stay legally in its territory for at least three months. The 2015 figure was a nosedive from 748 North Koreans in 2008, when the EU's statistical authority began to compile such data.Other comparable figures were 352 in 2009, 284 in 2010, 433 in 2011, 262 in 2012, 294 in 2013 and 339 in 2014, according to the report.(123rf)The number of North Korean citizens who received residence permits for family-related reasons was 27 last year, just 16 percent of the 167 recorded in 2008, the report said. The North Korean government's control of overseas workers' family members is believed to be the main reason for the sharp drop, North Korea experts said.They said that Pyongyang has banned overseas workers from bringing their family members to third nations in order to take them as hostages amid the mounting defections abroad in recent years.A notable change is found in Britain, where Thae Yong-ho, a minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, defected to South Korea with his wife and children in August due to being disillusioned with the Kim Jong-un regime and concerns about his children's future.The number of North Koreans acquiring residence permits in Britain plunged from 294 in 2008 to 28 in 2013, 18 in 2014 and just one in 2015, the report showed.In particular, the 2008 figure included 115 family members of dispatched officials and workers.But the number of family members receiving British residence permits dropped to seven in 2011, four in 2012, five in 2013, one in 2014 and zero last year. (Yonhap)","4":"An annual ceremony will be held at the United Nations park in the southern port city of Busan this week to commemorate the fallen heroes of the Korean conflict, the war veterans ministry said Monday. Nearly 2 million soldiers from 21 countries were dispatched to fight alongside South Korean soldiers in the 1950-53 war under the UN flag against the invading North Korean forces. More than 150,000 of them were killed, wounded, went missing or became prisoners of the war. To remember the fallen heroes, about 100 foreign Korean War veterans and their families from 13 countries will visit the country to attend the event from Wednesday through Sunday, according to the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.The \"Turn Toward Busan\" commemoration has been held annually on Nov. 11 in honor of the war dead since 2008. In major events, the veterans are scheduled to visit the UN Memorial Cemetery in Busan, the burial place for United Nations Command soldiers, on Friday to take part in commemoration event, the ministry said in a statement.The guests at the event include Vincent Courtenay, 82, who fought the war and first suggested the idea of the Turn Toward Busan commemoration in 2007, and Canadian Senator Yonah Martin who helped establish July 27 as the Korean War veterans' day in his country, it said.Some 30,000 UN Korean War veterans have been to South Korea since 1975 as part of the government's programs to express special thanks to those who fought for freedom and defended the country from invasion.

Early in the morning, An Chong-bum, a former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, was arrested on charges of abusing authority and attempted coercion, referring to his alleged involvement in raising funds for nonprofit organizations as a cover to channel money to Park\u2019s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.Funds worth some 80 billion won ($70 million) was raised by contributions from local firms -- including Lotte Group, SK Group and Posco -- for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation. An and Jeong Ho-seong -- a former secretary for private presidential affairs suspected of leaking government documents to Choi -- were grilled Sunday, along with Choi herself. The scandal centers on suspicions that Choi -- a 60-year-old civilian and the daughter of Park\u2019s mentor Choi Tae-min -- had accessed presidential documents and classified information, meddled in various state affairs, siphoned state funds and received unlawful favors.\u00a0 Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, looks at reporters when asked about his embezzlement charges, before entering the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office for questioning on Sunday. (Yonhap)Woo Byung-woo -- the former senior secretary for civil affairs accused of embezzlement and abuse of authority -- is also being suspected of condoning Choi\u2019s actions. He refused to comment on the issue when appearing before the prosecution for questioning Sunday. As investigators brace themselves for the unprecedented prosecutorial questioning of an incumbent president, the focus now is on the extent to which Park was involved in the scandal.Local media reported recently that An had said his role in raising funds for the foundations was under orders from Park herself. Another report claimed that Park ordered her staff to have the 30 biggest conglomerates in the country raise 100 billion won ($87.6 million) for the foundations, in stark contrast to her saying previously that the donations were done with a \u201chelping hand out of good intent.\u201dPark on Friday issued an apology for the scandal and vowed to cooperate with the ongoing prosecutorial investigation, as well as a separate probe by an independent counsel, if necessary. Although Park has admitted to letting Choi revise her speeches in the early part of her time in office, she claimed that this stopped as soon as the presidential staff was formed. But a tablet PC supposedly owned by Choi shows that leaking classified documents continued well into the later part of Park\u2019s tenure, and included sensitive information such as secret military meetings with North Korea.The Constitution states that a sitting president is immune from criminal prosecution while in office, unless he or she has committed treason via instigation. But Kim Seon-Taek, a professor of constitutional law at Korea University, said in a recent column that the clause only postpones the time of indictment of a president until he or she has left office.\u201cEven if the president cannot be prosecuted immediately, one needs to be investigated for acquisition of evidence for post-retirement indictment. ... Therefore an investigation for evidence gathering and preservation can and must be conducted on an incumbent president,\u201d he wrote.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong on Thursday told the National Assembly that the ministry will recommend to the president that she subject herself to questioning, if deemed necessary to uncover the truth. It marked a flip-flop from an earlier stance when he said that Park would not be subject to a probe.Local civic group People\u2019s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy has filed criminal charges against Park, An and Jeong, long with other Cheong Wa Dae officials and heads of local conglomerates on multiple suspicions including bribery, obstruction of civic duties, violation of laws concerning military secrets, leaking classified diplomatic relations and violating the law on presidential documents. The prosecution has yet to apply bribery charges to anyone involved in the scandal, instead focusing on those who have abused authority. This has raised concerns that the investigators are \u201cgoing easy\u201d on the president and her aides, by apparently not recognizing the illegal nature of the foundations\u2019 establishment.While there has been initial debate over whether a president should be probed while in office, a series of evidence, testimonies and public anger have tilted the scales against her. A Gallup Korea poll showed 5 percent approval rating for Park -- an all-time low for any South Korean president. An estimated 200,000 citizens also gathered in central Seoul on Saturday, demanding Park step down.

These are the key findings of the annual Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to be released Monday by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This year\u2019s report has revealed some worrying trends in Koreans\u2019 overall lifestyle and diet patterns. (123rf)Obesity has increased markedly for men, found the report, particularly among those aged 30-39. The male obesity rate stood at 39.7 percent in 2015, a 5 percentage point increase from a decade ago. For those in their 30s, the figure increased from 38.1 percent to 43.6 percent over the 10-year period. For women, the obesity rate fell slightly from 27.3 percent in 2005 to 26 percent in 2015.\u00a0 Forty-one percent of Koreans \u201cwalk regularly\u201d --- walking five days a week for at least 30 minutes per day and more than 10 minutes at a time. A decade ago, the ratio was 60.7 percent. As for alcohol consumption, more than half of Korean men are heavy drinkers, which are defined by drinking more than seven glasses of soju at one sitting at least once a month for the past year. For women, the bar is lower at five glasses of soju, and the survey showed that 23.2 percent of them belong to this category.\u00a0 (Korea Herald file photo)The number of female heavy drinkers have been growing, but the 23.2 percent of 2015 is a new record. It also marks an increase of 6 percentage points from a decade ago. The smoking rate among men dropped to a record low in 2015, dipping below 40 percent for the first time. About 39.3 percent of Korean men aged 19 or older were smokers last year, down 3.8 percentage points from the previous year\u2019s 43.1 percent. That marks the lowest level since the data began to be complied in 1998.  The male smoking rate has been declining since peaking at 66.3 percent in 1998. The number fell below 50 percent by 2007 and continued to fall, reaching 42.1 percent in 2013. The exception was 2014 when it rebounded to 43.1 percent.\u00a0 (123rf)The percentage of teenage smokers has also declined, dropping from 14.3 percent in 2005 to hit 9.6 percent in 2015 -- the first time it recorded a figure below 10 percent. \u201cThe decline in the numbers of male and teenage smokers are attributable to anti-smoking policies such as expanding non-smoking areas and raising cigarette prices,\u201d the Health Ministry explained. The male smoking rate includes those who have smoked more than five packs or 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and are still smoking. For teenagers, the rate is calculated by counting those who have smoked at least once in the recent month.By Jo He-rim\u00a0(herim@heraldcorp.com)","7":"North Korea may launch a intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) around the time US citizens go to the polls to pick their new president, a local military source said Sunday.According to the official source, the military is carefully checking developments taking place in the reclusive country and monitoring the movement of the Musudan missiles that are mounted on mobile launchers.The US presidential election takes place on Tuesday, with the Democratic and Republican candidates locked in a close race according to many surveys.The Musudan or BM-35 missile is a IRBM with a reported range of some 3,500 kilometers, which is enough to allow it to target the US Pacific territory of Guam. The island is home to many strategic assets that can support South Korean and US forces in the event of a conflict breaking out on the Korean Peninsula.\"Speculation of a launch taking place in the near future comes as North Korean experts have said Pyongyang will likely want to send a strong message to the next president,\" another military official, who declined to be identified, said. He added the North recently has carried out many of its provocations to coincide with key foreign events.Others said if the launch succeeds this time around, it will highlight Pyongyang's growing nuclear and long-range missile capability that will give it more leverage in potential future talks.Both the South Korean military and the US forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula said they are utilizing all available resources to keep close tabs on movement of missiles.The military said it had detected a Musudan missile near Kusong in North Pyongan Province. The region is where the North fired off a Musudan on Oct. 20.The North is known to have first fielded the IRBM in 2007, but it only test fired it for the first time on April 15 of this year.Since then, it has fired eight missiles with only one, which was launched on June 22, flying any distance. That missile flew about 400 km after reaching an altitude of 1,400 km.Besides the missile launch, military forces here are not ruling out other forms of provocations by the North, although it has thus detected nothing out of the ordinary along the heavily guarded inter-Korean border.There has even been speculation that the North may be preparing for another nuclear test, which could drastically escalate tensions.After detonating its first nuclear device in 2006, the North tested nukes in 2009 and 2013. For 2016, the North conducted two nuclear tests in January and September. (Yonhap)","8":"North Korea's state radio station resumed broadcasting mysterious numbers Sunday after a eight-day break that could be some kind of coded message to its agents operating in South Korea.Radio Pyongyang, started broadcasting messages shortly after midnight (Seoul time), calling out a series of pages and numbers. The radio announcer \"gave review work in metal engineering to No. 21 expedition agents.\" The content was different from those transmitted in the early hours of Oct. 28.Since June 24, North Korea has sent out a total of 12 encrypted numbers broadcasts, with three being broadcast in October.Broadcasts of mysterious numbers are considered a kind of book cipher that was often used by North Korea to give missions to spies operating in South Korea during the Cold War era. Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence officials believe this form of sending orders to be totally outdated. Many have said the broadcast may be some sort of psychological strategy aimed at sparking internal confusion within South Korea.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000, when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.Tensions are already running high on the divided peninsula after North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9 and the unsuccessful launching of two Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile last month with some observers forecasting another kind of missile provocation in the coming days. (Yonhap)","9":"The number of North Korean defectors who have arrived in South Korea over the years will reach the 30,000 mark this month, the unification ministry said Sunday.The ministry in charge of formulating North Korean policy said there has been a 21 percent spike in defectors reaching the country this year compared to 2015. From January through October, 1,154 people have successfully escaped the repressive regime and sought a new life in the South.(Yonhap)\"As of late October, there are 29,948 former North Koreans in the South so the 30,000 mark should be reach around Nov. 15-16,\" an official said.He said Seoul plans to mark the occasion with a new resettlement policy that will better help escapees integrate into South Korean society.The new plan aims to facilitate greater social participation of North Korea defectors, help them find jobs and concentrate on helping youngsters assimilate into schools and their studies.Official data, meanwhile, showed that 2016 marked the first year since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power in late 2011 that the number of defectors increased noticeably.In 2011, 2,706 North Korean arrived in the South, but this number dropped to 1,502 the following year, and stayed almost flat at 1,514 in 2013, and dipped to 1,397 and 1,276 in the two following years respectively. The drop had been attributed to tighter border control along the North Korea-China frontier which is not heavily guarded.Official source attributed this year's increase to the \"reign of terror\" perpetrated by Kim and tighter international sanctions that is forcing North Korean workers living abroad to repatriate more money. The North Korean leader has purged many leading figures from positions of power and has resorted to terror tactics like public executions to enforce his rule.Besides such developments, many North Korean elites are opting to defect for the sake of their children's future as well as getting away from political oppression.Reflecting this, polls conducted by the unification ministry on defectors showed less people escaping the country because they were starving or for economic reasons.Before 2001, 66.7 percent of those that left the country said they were trying to get away from hunger, but this decreased to 57.9 percent in 2002-2005 period and dropped to just 12.1 percent from 2014 to this year.In contrast, those that cited freedom and discontent over North Korean politics reach 87.8 percent in the 2014-16 period from 33.3 percent before 2001 and 42.1 percent in the 2002-2005 period.

While appearing to embrace calls to ascertain the truth, Park\u2019s agreement to cooperate with the prosecution\u2019s probe signaled she would not step down from power.She also denied having known about Choi\u2019s extensive influence and illicit profiteering, only admitting to what she described as a betrayal of trust from a longtime friend.\u201cI feel sorry and miserable that a specific individual derived benefits in the process of key state projects which were meant to improve the nation\u2019s economy and the people\u2019s lives,\u201d Park said Friday in an address broadcast live to the nation. President Park Geun-hye. YonhapThis was the second \u201capology\u201d to come from the president since a series of reports early last week revealed circumstantial evidence showing Choi had long meddled in key state affairs.\u00a0Though she claimed to be \u201cdeeply responsible\u201d for the current circumstances, Park sidestepped criticism she failed in her duty as the state\u2019s control tower.\u201cThe prosecution should hence stand free from all (constraints) and reveal the truth, on which strict judicial measures are to be taken,\u201d Park said.She also referred to the prosecutors\u2019 recent detention of Choi and the arrest of former Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum as part of a \u201cthorough and prompt\u201d investigation. An, who has long been one of the most trusted advisers to Park, recently claimed during questioning that he had contacted Choi only under direct orders from the president.Park\u2019s detached tone was clearly distinguished from her earlier silence, which implied an apparent refusal to recognize the wrongdoings of her aides which could, in turn, lead to her own liability.The state chief\u2019s acceptance to be questioned, making for the first case in South Korea\u2019s political history of an incumbent president facing prosecutorial scrutiny, followed remarks by key officials the president should not be exempt from fact-finding procedures. \u201cMy answer is that all people, including the president, are equal before the law,\u201d said prime minister nominee Kim Byong-joon on Thursday in a press briefing.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong also said during a parliamentary committee meeting that he would suggest to the president that she respond to prosecutorial calls for questioning.Facing an imminent probe, Park once again elaborated on her relationship with the scandal-ridden Choi.\u201cSince I came to Cheong Wa Dae, I have severed ties with those around me, including family members, lest disreputable situations should occur,\u201d she said in a trembling voice.\u201cHaving nobody to assist me with my personal affairs, I came to seek help from my longtime acquaintance Choi.\u201dHer explanation, however, was contradicted by her estranged siblings -- younger sister Geun-ryeong and brother Ji-man, who\u00a0have long held grudges against Choi and her late father Choi Tae-min.\u00a0The two younger Parks had even filed a petition demanding their elder sister be \u201cfreed\u201d from the elder Choi\u2019s influence in 1990.\u201cBecause (Choi Soon-sil) stood by my side through my hardest times, it is true that in spite of myself, I lowered my guard,\u201d Park said, claiming to be a victim to Choi\u2019s betrayal of trust.The president also denied rumors she had taken up a shamanist cult or religion, seemingly distancing herself from Choi, who is the daughter of the late cult leader Choi Tae-min.\u201cIt is only suitable that I should offer explanations about what happened, but with the prosecutorial probe ongoing, I find it inappropriate to describe details on the case,\u201d Park added.She then urged the government to resume its functions so as to prevent a vacuum in state affairs, especially in the areas of national security and the economy. Though she did not mention the recent series of staff reshuffling, the president\u2019s call for government normalization was taken as a message to the opposition to stop their protest and cooperate with the incoming Cabinet.The opposition, which had been demanding a fundamentally renewed Cabinet under the leadership of an impartial prime minister, has been filing complaints over the hurried and covert way in which Park reshuffled key officials.By Bae Hyun-jung \/ (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","11":"President Park Geun-hye on Thursday named her new chief of staff and senior political adviser, wrapping up the extensive shake-up of her secretariat aimed at defusing protest over the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Her previous reshuffle decisions had triggered backlash for \u201cfailing to reflect the calls for reform,\u201d but this time the president chose to embrace a ranking opposition figure in an apparent gesture of reconciliation.It remains doubtful, however, whether the series of personnel replacements will be a valid solution to growing public fury against the president\u2019s alleged connections to the unprecedented scandal.Han Gwang-ok (yonhap)Park\u2019s pick to steer the presidential staff was Han Gwang-ok, the incumbent chairman of the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion and a former chief of staff for the late liberal President Kim Dae-jung.For the post of senior presidential secretary for political affairs, she tapped Hur Won-je, a former journalist-turned-politician and vice chairman of the Korea Communications Commission.\u201cWith his ample experience, as well as his devotion to democratization, Han will assist the president amid these difficult times and contribute to stabilizing state management,\u201d said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk.Han reciprocated by saying that he will \u201cgather opinions from all social standings and deliver them to the president.\u201dThe incoming presidential chief of staff is marked for his past affiliation with the liberal opposition. He served as chief of staff for the late President Kim Dae-jung and was also a fourth-term lawmaker in former bodies of the current main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Han seconded to the ruling conservative Saenuri Party in 2012, shortly before the presidential election, and has been in his current post as national cohesion chief ever since Park\u2019s presidential transition team kicked off in January 2013.Park\u2019s appointment of the former opposition figure was regarded back then as a gesture of political reform and social tolerance -- campaign pledges which she had vowed to achieve.The fact that he came from Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, which is part of the longtime liberal stronghold area in the southwest of the nation, also adds to the symbolic significance of his appointment.Despite the gesture of reaching across political boundaries, Park\u2019s personnel decision was at odds with the opposition.\u201cNot a day has yet passed since the latest shake-up which reflected her disconnection, not only from the public and opposition but from the ruling camp as well,\u201d said Democratic Party spokesperson Rep. Keum Tae-sup in a briefing.The runner-up opposition People\u2019s Party, too, blasted the president for turning a deaf ear to those asking for her explanation, apology and even resignation.Hur, the new senior presidential secretary for political affairs who replaces the feud-ridden Woo Byung-woo, formerly worked as a journalist for several local papers including the nation\u2019s leading progressive voice Kyunghang Shinmun. He also worked several years in broadcasting companies KBS and SBS, after which he joined political circles as a ruling party lawmaker in the previous 18th National Assembly.He served as a campaign strategist for Park during the primary back in 2007 to win the presidential nomination of the Grand National Party, the former body of the current Saenuri.His expected function as the president\u2019s political agenda chief is to \u201cplay a bridging role\u201d so as to ensure communication with the legislature and citizens, according to the Blue House spokesperson.Though the post of senior secretary for policy coordination, formerly occupied by scandal-linked An Chong-bum, still remains vacant, Thursday\u2019s appointments more or less filled most of the personnel blanks in top presidential posts.The embattled state leader appointed two new senior secretaries Sunday and a new prime minister Wednesday, along with a new deputy prime minister and public safety and security minister.Meanwhile, the prosecutorial investigation on Choi continues.

South Korean men's average life span is 78 years, 11.7 years longer than their counterparts in North Korea.The longevity gap began to appear in 1990, which the report attributed to North Korea's bout with floods, a series of natural disasters that caused food shortages and economic troubles, as well as dilapidated medical services.\u00a0 In 1965, South Korean women lived an average 57.6 years, not far different from 54.6 years for North Korean women.

A Han River water taxi is anchored at taxi stand inside Banpo Han River park. (Kim Da-sol\/The Korea Herald)The interior of the boat was luxurious and the seats were soft. Apart from a few bumps, the ride was surprisingly comfortable.It took about eight minutes for the water taxi to depart \u201cSeoraenaru\u201d ferry dock at Banpo Han River Park and arrive at Yeouido. \u201cUnless Han River freezes during winter, water taxis will be able to provide a quick and safe ride for commuters,\u201d Kim proudly said.\u00a0 (Kim Da-sol\/The Korea Herald)Akin to a chauffeur-driven limousine on the road, the water taxis were first introduced in Seoul in 2007. After years of slow business, with an average number of seven daily passengers, the service came to halt in April 2014, when it was revealed that the service\u2019s operator was Cheonghaejin Marine Co., a shipping company linked to the sinking of the Sewol ferry. Resuming the operation after a 2 1\/2 year hiatus with a new operator, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has also changed the target customer group. Of the eight water taxes in service, five will be mainly used by tourists for sightseeing, offering onboard programs such as feeding migratory birds and watching the sunset.\u00a0 The rest -- three taxis that can fit up to seven passengers -- will shuttle commuters. Traveling at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour, a water taxi can get from Jamsil to Yeouido in 40 minutes. A single trip costs 5,000 won ($4.35) -- 20 minutes faster and 13,000 won cheaper than a road taxi. \u201cWe are going to provide season tickets or T-money service for commuters in order to provide convenience to passengers and actively promote the water taxi as a form of transportation,\u201d said Kim Jung-ho, the manager of Han River water taxi operation in Seoul City.Despite the ambitious plans, hurdles seem to remain for the business to take off. \u201cWater taxis may be faster on the water, but it takes at least 15 minutes to walk from the water taxi stand to my office located at Jamsil Station. I think I would rather take the subway, despite it being super packed in the morning, since I would not have to walk so much,\u201d a 34-year-old office worker who commutes to Jamsil every morning told The Korea Herald. An American lawyer who frequently visits Seoul said she does not see the difference between a water taxi and the ferry cruise that started running on the Han River in July. \u201cWhen I visit the Han River, I normally opt for (the) sightseeing ferry because it is cheaper for a longer ride. I think maybe I could try a water taxi once, although the price is twice as much, for private use such as partying,\u201d she said.The multipurpose cruise ship Araho, a city-run sightseeing ferry cruise on the Han River, has been gaining popularity among citizens and foreigners for its onboard activities such as watching a traditional Samulnori show and buffet dining. Seoul City said the cruise attracted at least a thousand visitors over the summer this year. Kim, the manager of Han River water taxi operations at Seoul City said that water taxis can cater to a small group of passengers\u2019 needs as it operates eight different sightseeing courses. According to him, water taxis used for sightseeing will cost 25,000 won per person for the first 30 minutes of each ride, with 8,000 won charged for every additional 10 minutes. The price is far lower than the previous price of 70,000 won for a 30-minute trip. On the accessibility issue, Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would install more bicycle stands and run a public bicycle rental service around the water taxi stands so passengers can easily travel to nearby destinations or bus and subway stations. Environmentalists also take issue with water taxies. According to the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement, programs on the water taxis could negatively influence the ecosystem of animals that live at the Han River.\u201cMigratory birds are very sensitive when they visit (floating islets in the Han River) to rest. Programs such as feeding migratory birds on water taxis is an absolutely ridiculous idea,\u201d said Shin Jae-un from the KFEM.Bamseom, one of the uninhabited islets on the part of the Han River near Yeouido, is frequently visited by migratory birds such as mallards, great egrets, mandarins, common kestrels and spotbills throughout the year.While it offers no access to humans, Bamseom was officially designated as a habitat for migratory birds in 2012. It has been left as a natural sanctuary for its characteristic Ramsar wetlands. Some experts visit it for bird watching or observation of the unique ecosystem located in the heart of the city. Environmental activists also argued that the sound or waves that water taxis make could have an impact on animals such as migratory birds. \u201cSome civic groups are trying to reserve part of the Han River as a habitat for endangered animals such as porpoises,\u201d said an official from the KFEM.\u201cIf Seoul City decides to run water taxis without noticing the effects it has on the ecosystem of the Han River as well as its low economic benefits, it is making the same mistake as a previous mayor did a decade ago,\u201d an official added.

South Korea has been making efforts to toughen measures against illegal fishing following the sinking of one of its patrol boats last month.On Oct. 7, a 4.5-ton South Korean Coast Guard speedboat was rear ended and sank while it was carrying out a crackdown operation on Chinese vessels poaching in the Yellow Sea.

US military bases overseas are not only strategically valuable; they are cost effective as well,\" the report said.About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Seoul pays about half the costs, about $900 million a year, to help finance the troop presence.But Trump has called for Seoul to pay more, arguing the US should be prepared to pull out of the country unless it agrees to pay up. US officials, including Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of US forces in Korea, have said it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the US than it does in Korea.\"When Donald Trump says, 'We protect so many different countries. We get nothing,' it is important to consider both the monetary and strategic aspects of that assertion,\" the AAF report said. \"First, the fact is, host nations like Germany, Japan, and South Korea do pay for some of the cost of US military facilities - often a significant portion.\"Allies are already spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year to support American military bases in their countries, and security alliances \"go far beyond basic calculations of money and resources to considerations of strategy and interests,\" the report said.\"With revanchist Russian aggression and the renewed importance of the NATO alliance in Europe and the Chinese military build-up and North Korean nuclear ambition in Asia, the importance of the peacetime US military presence in Germany, Japan, and South Korea has perhaps never been more clear,\" it said.

Park canceled a luncheon with members of a committee on the reunification of the peninsula and instead met with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, to discuss her course of action. Yet no words came from Cheong Wa Dae as of Friday evening as to what she will do to settle the unrest. The Blue House, earlier in the day, said the president was \u201ccontemplating\u201d options, which includes the overhaul of Cabinet members and presidential aides. Pressing Park to promptly conduct\u00a0the personnel reshuffle, the Saenuri leadership on early Friday threatened to resign en masse. The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea pledged to suspend bipartisan efforts to investigate the scandal unless the president first conducted an overhaul and took responsibility for causing public uproar through her relationship with her confidante Choi Soon-sil.\u00a0 President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)Among others, it insisted on the replacement of the Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination Ahn Jong-bum and Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo, both of whom were embroiled in the scandal but have vowed to keep their positions. Sources expect the reshuffle to take place next week.As for the calls for Park to relinquish much of her power to a \u201cbipartisan government\u201d including a new prime minister, the presidential office appeared to be against the idea. \u201cDespite the shock from the scandal, the president maintains a steadfast commitment to running the country,\u201d a Cheong Wa Dae official said.\u00a0\u00a0 The unravelling scandal erupted Monday when cable TV channel JTBC reported to have found over 200 confidential presidential files on a trashed computer purportedly used by Choi. It revealed that Choi edited Park\u2018s speeches and had access to other documents, some containing sensitive issues such as inter-Korean relations. A survey from Gallup Korea released Friday shows Park\u2019s daily approval rating was down to 14 percent on Thursday, the lowest since her inauguration in February 2013. A large-scale anti-Park rally is scheduled to be held in Seoul on Saturday. Meanwhile, Jo In-geun, a former speechwriter for Park, came forward to the media Friday, after days in hiding since the scandal first broke. He denied the initial revelation that Choi Soon-sil edited the president\u2019s speeches. The presidential aide has been suspected of leaking the confidential document when he was in charge of speech writing between 2012 and 2014.\u00a0 Jo In-geun, President Park Geun-hye\u2019s former speechwriter, is surrounded by journalists in front of his office in Yeouido, Seoul, Friday.

He worked at Cheong Wa Dae until July this year. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who Choi is until I saw the news report.\u201d The initial TV report suggested that the speech scripts were appeared to have been edited by Choi up to three days ahead of its delivery by the president.The scandal also shifted the fortunes of political parties. Minjoo saw its poll number outpace that of Saenuri for the first time under the Park administration. Minjoo\u2018s approval rating stood at 29 percent, while Saenuri was at 26. The main opposition bloc accused Saenuri of failing to recognize its own responsibility for the scandal. It denounced the ruling party for defending the president and dismissing the infamous scandal as a political attack fabricated by the opposition bloc. Minjoo Chair Rep. Choo Mi-ae said Friday that until Saenuri apologized for their acts leading up the revelation of the scandal, her party would halt negotiations with Saenuri over the operation of an independent counsel to investigate the case.Alongside the apology, Minjoo also attached another two conditions to their return to the negotiation table: Dismissal of Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs who was embroiled in the scandal, and resignation of all the officials \u201chaving worked for Choi Soon-sil.\u201dThe announcement came amid partisan bickering over the procedure to appoint the independent counsel. Fearing that the current law would undermine the prosecutor\u2019s independence, Minjoo asserted that the lawmakers should pass a new law that prevents special prosecutors from being appointed by the president. \u201cPeople are outraged at Saenuri for coming to the table without any apology and trying to have the president appoint the prosecutor that would investigate herself,\u201d said Choo, adding that the president herself should undergo investigation. \u201cIt is a farce.\u201d\u00a0  Though Saenuri leadership refused to budge, dissenting calls emerged from Saenuri members outside the faction close to President Park. They said that the leadership should shift their position and embrace Minjoo\u2019s proposal to pass a new law to name an independent counsel. \u201cWhen we decided to adopt the independent counsel, we wanted to end the crisis as soon as possible. In that regard, it is not a bad idea to accept (Minjoo\u2019s) proposal,\u201d said Rep.

The committee may reportedly convene a meeting of all UN members to vote on the resolution's passage. Then the resolution will be moved to the General Assembly for final approval. Since 2005, the UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution condemning North Korea's dire human rights situation every year. The latest draft resolution recommends the UN Security Council refer the North Korean human rights situation to the International Criminal Court as did the corresponding resolutions in 2014 and 2015, according to the officials.\u00a0 This year's resolution newly specified that human rights violations in North Korea are being perpetrated by organizations that are the effective control of the North Korean leadership, closing in more on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his leadership.\u00a0 The draft also freshly shed light on human rights violations being inflicted on North Korean workers sent overseas that have their income confiscated by North Korean authorities for foreign currency, the officials said. It also points out North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests are negatively affecting the country's human rights conditions, according to the officials.North Korea has long denied accusations of human right violations and reacted angrily to the resolutions, claiming they are part of US-led efforts to topple the regime.

And the answer is very simple: no, it's not,\" he said at a regular press briefing.\"And that's not just the State Department. It's not just one agency. It's the entire US government. Our policy is the same. We want to see a verifiable denuclearization on the peninsula,\" he said.Clapper \"offered a frank assessment\" of the situation, but that doesn't mean that he was \"denouncing or walking back or changing our policy objectives, which is that denuclearization,\" Kirby said.On Wednesday, a ranking US House lawmaker has criticized Clapper for the suggestion.\"I was surprised to see the director say that. I have great respect for Director Clapper. I think he's a real straight shooter.But this is not the policy of the administration. It's certainly not my view either,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN.\"I don't think that we can, in any way, suggest that the North Koreans, that their position on nuclear weapons is somehow inevitable and unchangeable. That, I think, would pose a real danger not only on the peninsula and to our allies, but it sends the message to other potential proliferators that, if you stick to your nuclear guns long enough, the rest of the world will just come to accept it,\" he said.Clapper made the remark Tuesday, saying the North's denuclearization \"is probably a lost cause\" because the nuclear program is \"their ticket to their survival.\" Clapper also said, \"The best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap.\"Schiff said Clapper's suggestion is not the right view or policy.\"I think we need to put pressure, frankly, on China, maybe through the use of secondary sanctions, where we sanction financial institutions, including Chinese banks that continue to finance transactions with North Korea,\" the lawmaker said.The US should also warn China that unless it reins in Pyongyang, the US will \"have to increase our military and naval presence in the region; we're going to have to strengthen our missile defenses there, things the Chinese don't want to see but we will need to do to protect ourselves and our allies,\" he said.On Thursday, a senior South Korean official also said that Clapper's suggestion has \"some distance from the US policy.\"\"There is no change in the position of the US administration,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Denuclearization is, of course, their basic position and they also believe that imposing meaningful sanctions is the most effective way ... to get North Korea to return to the negotiating table.\" (Yonhap)","29":"With its mission to nurture talent and cultivate world leaders, Cheongna Dalton School in Incheon has become a top choice for parents seeking an international education for their children.

Ideally, social innovation helps us to tackle the root cause of the problems, instead of just to mitigate symptoms,\u201d said Tim Draimin, the executive director of Social Innovation Generation based in Vancouver, in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.For over a decade, Draimin has put effort into international nonprofit organizations and the social innovation ecosystem in Canada. In particular, he actively worked on bridging social innovation initiatives among the government, private companies, educational institutes and others. He visited Seoul last week to give a speech at the 2016 Future Innovation Forum in Seoul, hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government under the theme of \u201cA Window to the Future.\u201dTim Draimin, executive director of Social Innovation Generation, speaks during the 2016 Future Innovation Forum hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government last week. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)According to Draimin, social innovation is a set of new ideas that help people to tackle challenges such as social and environmental issues. It also helps people to imagine future forms of innovation. \u201cGenerally, business and social organizations we have now were built about half a century ago. Now is the time to challenge ourselves to change our minds,\u201d said Draimin. He emphasized that partnerships across organizations, sectors and countries can lead to new and better outcomes for citizens, citing Grameen Danone as one such example. Established in 2006, Grameen Danone is a joint venture between French food product group Danone and Bangladesh\u2019s Nobel prize-winning microfinance organization Grameen Bank. It provides children with key nutrients missing from diets in rural Bangladesh. \u201cHiring people in (the) Bangladesh community not only gave social impact in Bangladesh, but also led to new business opportunities and more cash flow to Danone.\u201cProgressive businesses which want to retain smart employees and improve their relationship with community, should ask this question to themselves: How can we incorporate thinking about community in our project and economic values in our business model?\u201dDraimin also spoke about government organizations\u2019 role of establishing and promoting cross-sectoral business models through education.Draimin\u2019s team at SIG is currently running a number of education programs and diploma courses at the University of Waterloo and other educational institutions. Some of the programs are even available online.\u201cYounger people are generally more open to newer ideas and opportunities represented by social innovations. Young people can learn how to apply innovation principals to existing social problems, that are also applicable in business, government, community and universities,\u201d Draimin said. \u201cWe face a lot of social challenges. In the future, many of these problems will require us to collaborate in order to understand the cultural differences between sectors. It will help us create new architecture of how we collaborate together to solve problems.\u201dBy Kim Da-sol (ddd@herladcorp.com)","34":"State prosecutors on Wednesday raided two nonprofit foundations allegedly linked to a controversial figure with close ties to President Park Geun-hye amid a widening scandal over corruption suspicions.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it raided a total of nine places, including the Mir Foundation and the K-Sports Foundation in southern Seoul, suspected of raising a combined 80 billion won ($70 million) from conglomerates with the help of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the country's big business lobby group.There have been allegations that the money at the foundations -- established in 2015 and early this year, respectively -- was funneled to Choi Soon-sil, who is suspected to be the behind-the-scenes power broker of the current administration. Her house and the FKI office were also included in the raid.Prosecutors said they have confiscated related documents and hard disks so they can conduct a thorough investigation. The raids came a day after Park offered a rare public apology over a leak of dozens of presidential speeches to Choi before they were made public.Acknowledging her ties to Choi, which go back decades, the president said she asked for consultation \"out of the best intent\" to be more thorough in her works. Still, the controversy has been growing after local broadcaster JTBC, who first reported on the document leak, said late Tuesday that there were other documents handed over to Choi, indicating her possible broader intervention in state affairs.Choi -- the daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min and ex-wife of Park's former secretary Chung Yun-hoi -- does not hold any official government position. Park earlier said Choi helped her from the time she was a lawmaker until the early stage of her presidential term, without elaborating on the specific dates.Also on Wednesday, prosecutors summoned a former head of The Blue K, where Choi is known to be the owner, to investigate whether any money was unlawfully funneled to her. Blue K is suspected of trying to get funding from the Mir and K-Sports foundations.

Chartered flights are operated upon government approval, usually in busy travel seasons. The latest requests were filed ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season in late January when a great number of Chinese are expected to travel to South Korea. The cancellation took place simultaneously as the Chinese government rejected approval for South Korean airlines' similar requests to run non-scheduled flights between the countries in January.The Chinese disapproval delivered to three South Korean air carriers -- Korean Air Lines, Asiana Airlines and Jeju Air -- on Friday was critically portrayed by the South Korean media as retaliation for Seoul's decision to deploy the Terminal-High Altitude Area Defense, an advanced U.S. missile shield, on the Korean Peninsula.\"Usually, both countries communicate before (any decision) on the chartered flight issue, but this time we didn't and were also given no specific reason for the disapproval,\" a ministry official said.The official said South Korean diplomats in China are contacting local airlines and trying to find out why the decision was made.(Yonhap)","38":"North Korea's state radio station resumed broadcasting mysterious numbers Sunday after a nine-day break that could be some kind of coded message to its agents operating in South Korea.An announcer at Radio Pyongyang, started reading a series of messages shortly after midnight (Seoul time), calling out a series of numbers.

Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence officials believe this form of sending orders to be totally outdated. Many have said the broadcast may be some sort of deception strategy aimed at sparking confusion within South Korea.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000, when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.Tensions are already running high on the divided peninsula after North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9 and the unsuccessful launching of two Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile in recent weeks.

The annual Security Consultative Meeting between South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo and US Defense Secretary Ash Carter came one day after their joint meeting involving Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Secretary of State John Kerry. After the \u201ctwo-plus-two\u201d talks, they unveiled plans to launch a vice-ministerial consultative body tasked with studying how to improve the execution of the US\u2019 extended deterrence.\u00a0 From left: South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ash Carter are seen before a meeting at the State Department in Washington, Wednesday. (AP-Yonhap)The consecutive sessions appear to be intended to defuse growing anxiety over the US\u2019 security safeguard here following the communist state\u2019s fourth and fifth atomic experiments this year. Many lawmakers and experts have since been calling for bringing back US tactical nuclear weapons, withdrawn from the peninsula in the 1990s, going beyond a one-off dispatch of fighter planes and other weapons upon Pyongyang\u2019s provocations. Some even argue that Seoul should build its own deterrence strategy involving a nuclear-powered submarine or bombs if necessary. Ahead of the SCM, the two countries\u2019 defense agencies are believed to have been looking into the possibility for a standing deployment of the B-1B bomber and Aegis-equipped destroyer. \u201cI assured the minister of our commitment, the United States\u2019 commitment, to defend South Korea through a robust combined defense posture and through extended deterrence, including the US nuclear umbrella, conventional strike and missile defense capabilities,\u201d Kerry said during a joint press conference with Yun.Yun also reaffirmed Seoul\u2019s commitment to a nuclear-free peninsula, adding that the envisioned Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group will take on not only military agendas but also the strategic and policy-wise dimensions. \u201cIt\u2019s time to further step up our efforts to bolster international pressure over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats which are becoming more dangerous than ever, rather than talking about our policy as one of the most exemplary non-nuclear nations,\u201d the minister said. At the outset of the four-way meeting, the defense chiefs warned Pyongyang against further provocations. The North fired another intermediate ballistic missile earlier Thursday in a fresh show of force, though it appears to have failed. Han highlighted the grave challenges posed by the regime, likening it to a \u201cblade to our throat.\u201d The defense chiefs\u2019 meeting is part of their drive to \u201cmodernize our alliance to seize new opportunities and to address evolving threats,\u201d Carter said, stressing the need for a \u201ccredible\u201d deterrence. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d the defense secretary said. \u201cAny attack on America or our allies will not only be defeated, but also any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an overwhelming and effective response.\u201d With the UN Security Council working on crafting new sanctions over last month\u2019s underground detonation, the US is focusing on plugging a \u201cloophole\u201d and preventing \u201cabuse\u201d of the existing resolution that allows the North\u2019s coal exports for livelihood purposes, Kerry said.

One of them was that she colluded with Choi to strong-arm Samsung and other local conglomerates into donating some tens of millions of dollars to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi.Moon Hyung-pyo, chief of the National Pension Service (NPS), is accused of pressuring the state fund to back a major merger deal between Samsung subsidiaries on behalf of the presidential office when he was health minister last year. The 60 year old served as the country's health minister from December 2013 to August 2015.Early Saturday, the Seoul Central District Court issued a writ to prolong his detention, making him the first suspect to be formally arrested by the special investigation team. Judge Cho Eui-yeon said that criminal facts have been explained and the reason and need for Moon's arrest are recognized.Moon was put into emergency detention early Wednesday after appearing before the special investigation team the previous day for questioning.There have been allegations that the presidential office, Cheong Wa Dae, pressured the state fund -- which held an 11.6 percent stake in Samsung C&T; Corp. and a 5 percent stake in Cheil Industries Inc. -- to support the conglomerate in return for favors Samsung gave to Choi.Moon, who had denied exerting influence in the pension fund's decision at a parliamentary hearing, reversed his statement during an interrogation by the independent counsel team, according to the probe team's spokesman, Lee Kyu-chul.Investigators are now looking into whether President Park was directly involved in the process, which they think could constitute bribery.The investigation team, led by independent counsel Park Young-soo, has been accelerating its probe since its official launch last week, summoning a number of figures implicated in the scandal.

Those capabilities include F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, V-22 Ospreys, B-2 bombers, and our newest surface warfare ships,\" Carter said.The Pentagon is also devoting resources to new capabilities critical to the rebalance, he said, adding that the US is increasing the number of surface ships and making each of them more lethal, while investing in Virginia-class submarines, advanced undersea drones, the new B-21 long-range strike bomber, and state-of-the-art tools for cyberspace, electronic warfare, and space.Under the rebalance policy, the alliance between the US and South Korea \"took a major step forward\" in 2014 with an agreement to a conditions-based, rather than timeline-based, approach to determining when South Korea would obtain operational control of alliance forces in the event of a war, Carter said.In July this year, the two allies also decided to deploy the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea at the earliest possible date as part of an effort to defend against North Korean ballistic missiles, he said.Carter also noted strides in efforts to forge stronger trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and Japan.\"The US-Japanese-South Korean partnership helps coordinate responses to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations, and earlier this year, the trio conducted its first-ever trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise,\" he said.Such Asia-Pacific security networks will help ensure stability amid a number of security challenges, including North Korea's provocative behavior, he said.

Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Defense Minister Han Min-koo will join US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ash Carter in Wednesday's \"two plus two\" talks, a biennial gathering designed mainly to demonstrate the firmness of the alliance and discuss strategies to deal with the North.The meeting comes just a few days after the communist nation carried out a banned test Saturday of a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile, believed to be capable of reaching the US territory of Guam, about a month after its fifth nuclear test.The test was unsuccessful as the missile exploded shortly after take-off, but the launch still showed how committed the North is to developing nuclear-armed, long-range missiles. Officials and experts have warned Pyongyang could keep conducting nuclear and missile tests in coming months.Wednesday's talks are expected to focus on ways to strengthen the US \"extended deterrence\" protection of South Korea and to ramp up pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang, including through a strong new U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution and unilateral sanctions of their own.\"Extended deterrence\" refers to the threat of nuclear retaliation to deter attacks on allies. The US has provided extended deterrence or a \"nuclear umbrella\" to South Korea after withdrawing nuclear warheads from the country in the early 1990s.\"We will discuss comprehensive strategies to deal with North Korean threats. In particular, we're going to have in-depth discussions on ways to specify and institutionalize extended deterrence, which is a key element in the US security commitment to South Korea,\" Yun told reporters during a joint visit with Han to the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.Yun also said the two sides will discuss ways to maximize effects of sanctions on the North.On Thursday, the two sides are scheduled to hold annual defense ministers talks, known as the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM), where Han and Carter are expected to discuss detailed \"extended deterrence\" measures, possibly including permanently deploying US \"strategic assets\" in the South, such as nuclear-capable B-52 and B-1B bombers, F-22 stealth fighter jets and nuclear-powered submarines.\"In the SCM talks, we will jointly assess North Korea's threats and the situation in the North ... and discuss ways to guarantee the implementation of extended deterrence, including the US nuclear umbrella, so as to cope with North Korea's nuclear and missile threats,\" Han told reporters during the visit to the war memorial.The US has temporarily sent such strategic assets to South Korea as a show of force in the wake of the North's two nuclear tests in January and September, but perceptions have grown among South Koreans that such one-off missions are not enough at a time of unprecedented threats from the North.Permanent deployment of such military hardware is expected to reassure South Koreans of the US defense commitment amid heightened security jitters that sparked calls for developing the country's own nuclear weapons or bringing US nuclear bombs back into the country. Such sophisticated weapons would also serve as a strong warning against the North.In the SCM talks, the two sides are also expected to check on progress in efforts to deploy the US THAAD missile defense system in the South, while reaffirming that the deployment is aimed only at defending against North Korean threats and poses no threats to China and other countries.

Some political watchers now say the issue may linger on for months, exerting significant damage on Moon ahead of the presidential election slated for December next year.\u201cThis is not just about evaluating the sayings and doings of an individual politician, but about restoring the (nation\u2019s) damaged diplomatic stature,\u201d said Saenuri Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun at the party\u2019s emergent meeting.Moon Jae-in (center) conserves with Song Min-soon (right) in this file photo from April 2007. (Yonhap)The given dispute stemmed from the book \u201cMoving the Glacier,\u201d a political memoir published last week by Song Min-soon, who served as foreign minister under the former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun administration while Moon was presidential Chief of Staff.Song argued that the Roh administration had decided to withdraw a vote after hearing negative response from the North, which conflicted with a claim by former government officials that the decision had been made before contacting the North.Saenuri\u2019s chief also reiterated his earlier use of the controversial expression \u201ccovertly colluding\u201d to describe Moon\u2019s alleged inquiry to North Korea back in 2007 about whether Seoul should vote to adopt the UN resolution condemning Pyongyang\u2019s human rights situation.\u201cA matter that may decide the people\u2019s fate should not be discussed covertly,\u201d Lee said.\u201cYet (Moon) did it in secret, which leads to suspicions that there may have been other similar cases (of covertly contacting the North).\u201dFloor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, too, blasted Moon, especially on his recent claim that he did not \u201cremember the details\u201d of the disputed event.\u201cShould the memoir be true, this is an abandonment of sovereignty and an obvious treason to the nation,\u201d he said.\u201cMoon keeps changing his words, without even clarifying the suggested suspicions. It is hard to believe that a man like this assisted the president.\u201dThe party\u2019s vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup refuted the opposition\u2019s claim that Saenuri was using the issue to launch an ideological attack on presidential hopeful Moon.\u201cOur goal is not to launch an ideology-based battle against Moon, but to find out the truth about this sensational case and to report it to the people.\u201dThe presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, while refraining from detailed comments, is expected to mention the issue in the president\u2019s meeting with senior secretaries. The top officials\u2019 meeting, which was suddenly called off Monday, is likely to take place Thursday, just a day before the parliamentary state audit on the Blue House.Facing such mounting aggression, Minjoo set forth a counterargument, defending its former chairman and accusing the ruling party of clouding corruption scandals.\u201cThe Saenuri Party is riding on a melting glacier, which will soon disappear like a mirage,\u201d said floor leader Rep.

In September, the country conducted a ground test for a new high-powered rocket engine, sparking speculation that it is moving closer to the goal.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to \"permanently\" defend the pursuit of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.Lee said that the repressive regime is expected to stick to the \"byeongjin\" policy, adding that North Korea is not likely to change its behavior in the near term.\"Along with sanctions and pressure, there is the need to consider pursuing strategic persuasion and offering incentives in dealing with the North,\" the report showed.

It was believed to be the seventh test of the missile this year, coming after June's successful launch in which the missile entered space and re-entered Earth's atmosphere.\"We strongly condemn this missile test, because it violates the UN Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea's launches like this one,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at a regular press briefing.\"The United States is prepared, and has mobilized the appropriate military resources to defend our allies and ourselves.And that is why the United States has been in discussions with our South Korean allies about deploying a THAAD battery and anti-ballistic missile battery to South Korea to protect South Korea from the ballistic missile threat emanating from North Korea,\" he said. Earnest said there are other missile-defense equipment and resources that have been mobilized in the Asia pacific region, including Japan, Alaska, and Guam, to counter missile threats from the North and to protect the US and its allies.\"All of that is a reflection of the threat that emanates from North Korea. And all of that reflects the president's determination to ensure that the safety and security of the American people is protected,\" he said.Earnest also said that the US will continue to increase pressure on Pyongyang.Asked about a senior North Korean official's remarks that the North is prepared to launch a preemptive strike on the US and will continue nuclear tests, Earnest said the US has been \"deeply concerned about the willingness of the North Korean regime to ignore or even flout their basic international obligations.\"\"That hasn't just been a source of concern for the United States. It's also been a source of concern by our allies in South Korea and Japan. Both China and Russia have expressed concerns about this kind of destabilizing behavior from the North Koreans.And, you know, it's an indication of just how isolated the North Koreans are right now,\" he said.

It was believed to be the seventh test of the missile this year, coming after June's successful launch in which the missile entered space and re-entered Earth's atmosphere.\"They are continuing with an aggressive test schedule that involves, at least this time, demonstrating new operational capabilities. That increases the probability of individual tests failing, but it means they will learn more with each test even if it does result in failure,\" John Schilling, a top aerospace engineer with expertise in the North's missile programs, said.\"If they continue at this rate, the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile could enter operational service sometime next year -- much sooner than had previously been expected,\" he said in an article to 38 North, a website focused on North Korea analysis.The expert said it's noteworthy that the North conducted the latest test from the northwestern city of Kusong, away from the usual test site on the opposite side of the country. That could be an attempt to allow the missile to fly its fullest range without violating Japan's airspace, he said.In June's test, which was conducted from the usual site on the east coast, the North launched the missile at a lofted angle in order to avoid violating Japan's airspace. Though the missile landed in waters 400 kilometers away, the test was considered a success as it reached space and re-entered the atmosphere.\"Moving to a roadside near Kusong is like taking the training wheels off the bicycle, seeing if you really have mastered something new,\" Schilling said. \"From the west coast, launching south, a North Korean missile could fly 3,000 kilometers or more before splashing down in the Philippine Sea.\"The expert also said that last week's test shows Kusong could become the Musudan's operational basing area.\"There is a saying in our military that amateurs practice until they get it right, but professionals practice until they can't get it wrong. The North Koreans have just shown that they can still get it wrong, but they are still practicing,\" he said.\"Seven launches in seven months -- a rate greater than most US strategic missile programs. After a decade of keeping it on the back burner, the North Koreans are clearly committed to the Musudan. Another seven months of training and practice could bring them to a real initial operational capability,\" he said.

Britain has announced that it will send fighter jets and support planes to Asia, and that it will take part in exercises in South Korea together with South Korean and U.S. forces in early November.``This is a hostile act, openly joining the U.S. and South Korean forces in moves for a new war against us,'' said North Korean Foreign Ministry official Pak Yun Sik. ``Britain claims that this military exercise is not targeting us, but the U.S. and South Korea openly say that these military exercises are aimed at launching a strike against our military facilities and our command structure.'' North Korea usually responds to regular South Korea-U.S. military drills with weapons tests and fiery warlike rhetoric. It views the drills as an invasion rehearsal, but Seoul and Washington say the exercises are defensive in nature. North Korea has increased its opposition to military exercises in South Korea, and has conducted more than 20 missile launches and two nuclear tests this year.

The woman, once shrouded in secrecy, is President Park Geun-hye\u2019s friend of 40 years and the central figure of a sweeping corruption and peddling of influence scandal that sparked massive protests in South Korea and eventually led to the president\u2019s impeachment on Dec. 9. A daughter of Choi Tae-min, Park\u2019s late mentor and a shamanistic cult leader, the 60-year-old Choi is now jailed awaiting trial, accused of using her ties to Park to gain influence and personal favors and help her 20-year-old daughter receive special treatment in her education and sporting career. Park Geun-hye(Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye started 2016 on solid footing -- with job approval ratings over 40 percent -- and ended the year mired in a nightmare. Embroiled in a sweeping corruption scandal involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, Park is now impeached and suspended from office, pending an impeachment trial. The disgraced leader, however, insists the nation has not seen the last of her. Denying all accusations against her and despite abysmal support of just 4 percent, Park is gearing up for a tough fight at the Constitutional Court to save her job and reputation. Lee Jae-yong(Yonhap)What would have been an ambitious year of the debut of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong became a year of tumult, from the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7, prone to fire, to a humiliating parliamentary hearing that intensified public outrage against the conglomerate\u2019s alleged corruptive dealings with President Park Geun-hye and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Despite Lee\u2019s decision to join the boardroom in late October, widely seen as a modern-day coronation of the heir to the nation\u2019s largest conglomerate, a series of complex problems emerged including suspicions surrounding last year\u2019s merger between Samsung C&T; and Cheil industries.

The ailing shipper finally filed for court receivership in September. Further controversy was raised in November after the chairman admitted to having been pressured from Cheong Wa Dae to step down from the top position in the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics Organizing Committee.

Park had rested from LPGA Tour events since June. She then entered a KLPGA event just two weeks before the opening of the Olympic Games, where she missed the cut.

The actual amount of single-use cups used here can be much greater than the government tally because the ministry's data was based only on sales from 12 large coffee chains and five fast food restaurant brands.Use of throwaway cups surpassed the 600-million mark for the first time in 2011. It briefly plunged to 567.55 million in 2012 before rising again to 642.69 million in 2013.An undated photo shows civic activists campaigning against disposable cups. (Yonhap)The recovery rate of disposable cups, however, has been declining year after year. South Korea had a disposable cup recovery rate of 78.4 percent in 2011, but it went down to 78.3 percent in 2012 and plunged to 73.6 percent in 2013.Last year, the country had a recovery rate of 68.9 percent, 2.6 percentage points down from 2014.The rise of disposable cup use is apparently affected by increased coffee consumption in the country, according to industry observers. The 2015 data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs showed South Koreans drank coffee an average of 12.3 times a week, more frequently than eating the nation's staple white rice (seven times) and main side dish kimchi (11.8 times). \"Although use of disposable cups is increasing, related regulations are falling,\" said Ha Tae-keung, a Saenuri Party lawmaker who is also a member of the Environment and Labor Committee in the National Assembly.\"In 2008, the disposable cup deposit program was abolished, and paper cups were excluded from being subject to regulations.Considering disposable cups became hideous objects on the streets this summer following the coffee consumption increase, we need urgent efforts from consumers, producers and regulators to design recycling measures and to reduce disposable cup use,\" Ha said. (Yonhap)","56":"Driving up sanctions on North Korea is expected to be a main pillar of a Hillary Clinton administration policy on the communist nation, as her likely defense secretary said pressure is the only way to force Pyongyang back to serious talks.Michele Flournoy, who served as an under secretary of defense during President Barack Obama's first term, said in a wide-ranging interview with Yonhap News Agency that there is no point in holding negotiations with the North unless it's prepared to talk about disarming.\"They have to be motivated by sanctions and they have to demonstrate their seriousness in some way, whether it's stopping these provocations and\/or taking some of the steps that they've promised in the past to show that they're curtailing their nuclear weapons activities,\" Flournoy said.The interview was a chance to preview what Clinton's policy on Korea would look like, as Flournoy is considered a top foreign policy and national security adviser to Clinton. She has also been widely talked about as the top candidate for defense secretary under a Clinton White House.Flournoy tamped down calls for an early reopening of negotiations with the North.\"Negotiations are a waste of time unless you have those (denuclearization) signals from them,\" she said.When it comes to dealing with Pyongyang, Flournoy said that all options are on the table, including pre-emptive military action, adding that pre-emptive action is even in the UN charter when talking about self-defense against imminent threats.Still, however, the focus should be on strengthening sanctions, she said.\"I think all options would be on the table, but the focus of our policy should be to try to put through sanctions and other pressure, get the leadership to come back to the negotiating table and make good on their earlier promises of denuclearization,\" Flournoy said.She stressed that sanctions on Pyongyang should include cutting off energy supplies to the North and restricting trade along the long North Korean-Chinese border. She said the US should engage China seriously to have it enforce sanctions to rein in the recalcitrant neighbor.\"We know that there is illicit activity going on right now that is already in violation of existing sanctions and much of that is coming through China,\" she said. \"We need to engage China to get them to try to be more serious about enforcing existing sanctions, let alone future sanctions on their own soil.\"Last month, the US imposed sanctions on a Chinese company for providing the North with \"dual-use\" items that can be used in nuclear and missile development. It was the first time the US has ever sanctioned a Chinese firm with regard to Pyongyang's weapons programs.Flournoy said that such sanctions will continue.\"We are trying to ensure that the sanctions are actually implemented and enforced. I'm sure the US will use its diplomacy anywhere where those sanctions are being violated,\" she said.Flournoy also said that the US and South Korea, while ramping up sanctions, should also make sure to have the \"full range of options for deterrence.\"She also said the US commitment to South Korea's security shouldn't be questioned.\"The US needs to work hard to reassure South Korea that their security is guaranteed by the US, all means at our disposal up to and including our nuclear deterrent if necessary,\" Flournoy said.That differs sharply from accusations by Republican candidate Donald Trump that allies are free-riders sucking up American taxpayer dollars for their own defense and that the US should be prepared to abandon them unless they pay more.Flournoy stressed just how important it is to have allies and to honor security commitments to them. Clinton has also said repeatedly during her campaign that alliances are a \"source of strength\" that makes the US safer.\"I think most Americans, most members of Congress, most presidential candidates understand that in a very complex dynamic security environment we gain a great deal from having strong allies with shared interests and shared values who are willing to work alongside us to create stability and security,\" Flournoy said.Flournoy, currently CEO of the Center for a New American Security, a major think tank in Washington, is scheduled to visit South Korea early next week with a group of next-generation leaders from the think tank.

In his presentation, he suggested the need to study the influence of the three countries' maritime exploration and development on Dokdo.Professor Kim Hyun-soo of Inha University offered a legal perspective on the navigation of waters around Dokdo, while Professor Je Seong-ho of Chung-Ang University discussed the relationship between the 1998 South Korea-Japan fisheries agreement and the issue of sovereignty over Dokdo.The one-day symposium was held under the theme, \"Korea's sovereignty over Dokdo and overcoming the challenges of the international environment.\" (Yonhap)","61":"The National Assembly's regular audit virtually ended Friday, with political watchers pointing out that the lawmakers failed to come up with constructive results due to a series of boycotts and partisan quarrels.The regular audit, which kicked off on Sept. 26, started amid the absence of the ruling Saenuri Party, which had refused to take part in proceedings on the controversy over the neutrality of the parliamentary speaker.Saenuri said Speaker Chung Sye-kyun unfairly took sides in the passage of a motion to dismiss new Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo on ethical lapses, which even led to a hunger strike by party chief Rep. Lee Jung-hyun.Chung, who is originally from the Minjoo Party of Korea, effectively fueled the controversy when he was heard in a voice recording saying that the ruling party should not \"ask for something for free,\" indicating the speaker may have wanted to utilize the dismissal motion to induce Saenuri to make concessions on other issues that are important to the opposition. While the ruling party eventually ended the protest a week afterward, the repercussions continued throughout the later parts of the audit as the parties engaged in existing and new political wrangling rather than bringing key issues important to the people and the country to the table.Saenuri blamed the opposition parties for the deadlock at the National Assembly, adding they only focused efforts on criticizing President Park Geun-hye, aimed at gathering support ahead of the presidential race in 2017.\"The parliament must accept the public's criticism that the audit only focused on the upcoming presidential election and ignored the livelihoods of the people,\" Rep. Kim Gwang-lim of Saenuri said.The opposition bloc, however, said they were unable to roll out proper audit proceedings due to the tie between Saenuri and the presidential office.For one, opposition parties have been claiming that Cheong Wa Dae is suspected of being involved in raising some 80 billion won ($70 million) in funding for the controversial Mir and K-Sports foundations from the country's major conglomerates. The foundations were created to promote cultural content that can contribute to national economic growth. The debate surrounding the transparency of such foundations hindered lawmakers from handling other issues, political pundits said.Throughout the weeks of the regular audit, lawmakers were criticized for making hasty accusations.Rep. Park Jie-won of the People's Party had announced that the country's spy agency has been taking steps to prepare Park's retirement home, which was later revealed to be groundless.The Minjoo also accused the head of the Korean Intellectual Property Office of using his power to influence a local defense company to hire his son. It later turned out the case involved a person with the same name as his son.Rep. Han Sun-kyo of Saenuri then came under spotlight after making an alleged sexist remark to a female lawmaker from Minjoo.A union of nongovernmental organizations that oversees the parliament's audit every year gave an \"F\" to the outcome of the first audit held by the 20th National Assembly, marking the lowest grade in 18 years. The grade is a notch lower than the \"D\" earned by the preceding parliament.The official closing date of the audit is slated for Wednesday, although most of the key proceedings will end Friday. (Yonhap)","62":"Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Friday urged the civil rights commission and other legal bodies to come up with clear and well-defined guidelines on the anti-graft law which went into effect last month amid confusion over interpretation.\"As we are at the early stage, and as around 4 million people are affected by the law, it is natural that some confusion exists,\" Hwang said during a government meeting to discuss the anti-graft law.\"There are controversies about whether a certain action violates the law. Although the civil rights commission is making efforts, there is insufficient knowledge related to what is permissible and what is not,\" Hwang added.Under the so-called Kim Young-ran Law, launched in September, people working for the government, media outlets and schools are banned from receiving meals priced higher than 30,000 won ($27), gifts exceeding 50,000 won, and congratulatory and condolence money over 100,000 won.The prime minister also said the law should not hinder the civil servants from working actively, as it is not intended to do so.\"The law aims to establish a transparent society,\" the top policymaker said, urging related governmental bodies to bolster their understanding of the law so people can carry out their duties with enthusiasm. (Yonhap)","63":"Rising from second-in-command to acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has experienced a dramatic political upturn this year. This all in stark contrast to suspended President Park Geun-hye and a number of her key aides who are currently facing investigation over corruption allegations.The practical state affairs leader is now also being counted as a plausible presidential hopeful for the ruling Saenuri Party -- a rumor\u2019s made no effort to fully quash.\u201cWe have to expand on the \u2018one strike and you\u2019re out\u2019 system (concerning food) against those who misrepresent distribution dates or sell nonconforming products, so as to fundamentally prevent all unqualified sellers from setting foot back in the market,\u201d Hwang said Friday at a ministerial Cabinet meeting on food safety measures, gesturing at taking an active stance on the issue. Prime Minister and acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn chairs a meeting on bird flu countermeasures held at the Seoul Government Complex on Friday. Prime Minister\u2019s OfficeHe also chaired a public-private joint task force on responding to the bird flu virus sweeping through farms.His assertive tone over his presidential role during these key meetings was also reflected in a recent talk with reporters, where he refrained from denying a potential bid in the forthcoming presidential race.\u201cI have already told you everything,\u201d the prime minister said repeatedly during a luncheon with reporters Thursday, when asked in various formats whether or not he would run in the earlier-than-planned presidential election next year.Even when asked a clear-cut question, he did not rule out running for president.\u201cI will do my best in serving my current post, and once it is done, I will then make efforts for the future,\u201d he said.Since taking office as prime minister in June 2015, Hwang has officially presided as the No. 2 chief official in the Cabinet, standing next in line to President Park Geun-hye.Despite his position, however, Hwang has mostly been seen as an administrative assistant to the president, partly because of South Korea\u2019s powerful president-centered governance structure and partly because of Hwang\u2019s rigid character.He even came close to resigning when President Park suddenly tapped former liberal presidential aide Kim Byung-joon to be prime minister, as part of her effort to pacify the political turbulence following the outbreak of the extensive corruption scandal whirling around her confidante Choi Soon-sil.Hwang, who was given notice at the last minute reportedly via text message, immediately offered to resign, but soon withdrew his offer, as Kim\u2019s appointment was thwarted upon opposition backlash.It was the president\u2018s impeachment on Dec. 9 that brought the overshadowed prime minister to the center of the stage. Upon the legislature\u2019s passage of the impeachment resolution and the consequent suspension of Park\u2018s powers, Hwang became the ninth acting president in the nation\u2018s history, as well as the second to temporarily replace an impeached state chief.With a reinforced range of authority, Hwang also rose as a likely presidential choice for the ruling Saenuri Party. The conservative camp currently has few options, due to the mass defection of reformist members and the consequent estrangement of Ban Ki-moon, who was set to finish his final term as UN secretary-general on Dec. 31.By Bae Hyun-jung(tellme@heraldcorp.com)","64":"A senior official at North Korea\u2019s spy agency defected to the South last year, a news report said Wednesday, marking the latest in a recent series of elites seeking to escape from political oppression and the crumbling economy amid a tightening sanctions network. The director-general level official of North Korea's Ministry of State Security has told Seoul officials that the popular sentiment around Pyongyang was \u201cboiling\u201d with discontent about leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s ironfist rule, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified source familiar with North Korean affairs. The ministry, better known as \u201cBowibu,\u201d is a chief security and intelligence agency\u00a0that runs a secret police organization tasked with hunting down those suspected of anti-state and dissident activities and other political and economic crimes. Upon learning that the official had\u00a0fled, Kim Jong-un expressed unease, the report added. The South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee declined to confirm the latest defector, citing the lack of information. The report follows other high-profile defections in recent years involving senior military officers, diplomats and overseas workers. In August, Seoul unveiled the arrival of Thae Yong-ho, a minister of the North Koran Embassy in London, followed by the defection late last month of an official at the embassy in Beijing with his family. The\u00a0second\u00a0official was reportedly responsible for sourcing medical supplies for a Pyongyang clinic overseeing the health of the ruling family. In April, a group of 13 employees from a North Korean restaurant in China took asylum here. A colonel-level officer with the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a military intelligence organization, also came to the South last year, in addition to a diplomat in an African nation and his family.Rep. Lee Chul-woo (center) and lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party discuss solutions to North Korea's nuclear weapons program in a forum held at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)While a steady inflow of defectors has for years been business as usual, the perceived growth of departures among the relatively privileged class may point to economic trouble in the communist state further deepened by international sanctions over its nuclear program.The cash-strapped regime has thus been forcing diplomats and other overseas workers to find new ways to secure hard currency, sometimes by breaking the law, or face punishment, some defectors say. The number of North Korean defectors has shot up more than 20 percent on a yearly basis to 1,036 between January and September this year, Unification Ministry records shows. The share of those with college education or higher has also steadily risen, reaching 5.3 percent in 2012, 6.6 percent in 2013, 6.6 percent in 2014 and 7.3 percent in 2015. Data from the Korea Hana Foundation, a Unification Ministry affiliate offering resettlement support, show that doctors, teachers, researchers and other professionals make up about 5 percent of those who have come to South in the last three years, twice as many as that among defectors who have been staying here for five to 10 years. The ongoing getaways, especially of diplomats like Thae, have prompted Kim to expel Vice Foreign Minister Kung Sok-ung to a rural cooperative farm as punishment, according to a separate report by the JoongAng Ilbo daily. The spokesperson Jeong said the Unification Ministry is looking into information to verify the report. \u201cNext month, the number of North Koreans here will likely reach 30,000. In line with that, we\u2019re seeking to refine our defector policy in a way that promotes social integration,\u201d he said at a news briefing. \u201cWe\u2019re now working to tackle the existing system\u2019s problems and make our resettlement support system more effective.\u201d By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","65":"A group of South Korean private aid providers said Wednesday it has provided North Korea with $187,000 through the Red Cross to help it fight the latest floods in the country's northeast area.The Korea NGO Council for Cooperation with North Korea said it has sent the first batch of $100,000 to North Korea with the plan to send the remainder by next Tuesday in accordance with its agreement with the Red Cross.\"The money will be used to help displaced North Koreans in North Hamgyong Province as relief aid,\" the KNCCK said in a statement.Heavy rains hit North Korea's northeast area at the end of August, leaving more than 130 North Koreans dead and about 400 missing, according to the Red Cross.But the government voiced opposition to the aid providers' move, citing North Korea's provocative acts.\"It is not appropriate for some civic groups to extend aid to North Korea, given that Pyongyang conducted nuclear and missile tests even after the floods hit the country,\" an official at Seoul's unification ministry said.North Korea said last week that the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UN International Children's Emergency Fund had decided to supply emergency aid to North Korea over flood damage.South Korea earlier said that it will not provide aid to North Korea over the flooding amid heightened tensions following Pyongyang's nuclear test in early September.Seoul condemned North Korea for pouring money into its nuclear program while neglecting the suffering of its people in the flood-hit areas. (Yonhap)","66":"North Korea's state radio station resumed broadcasting mysterious numbers Friday in what could be some kind of coded message to its agents operating in South Korea.Radio Pyongyang, the North's state-run radio station, started broadcasting messages at 1:15 a.m. (Seoul time), calling out a series of pages and numbers, such as No. 69 on Page 894, before repeating them one more time.The radio announcer said, \"(I'm giving) review works in math lessons of the remote education university for No. 27 expedition agents.\" The content was the same as those transmitted in the early hours of Dec. 16.Since June 24, 20 of such encrypted numbers broadcasts have been discovered, with the latest one broadcast Sunday. (Yonhap)Broadcasts of mysterious numbers are considered a kind of book cipher that was often used by North Korea to give missions to spies operating in South Korea during the Cold War era. Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence officials believe this form of sending orders to be totally outdated.Many have said the broadcasts may be some sort of psychological strategy aimed at sparking internal confusion within South Korea.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000, when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.(Yonhap)","67":"The chief of South Korea's Navy said Tuesday acquiring nuclear-powered submarines can help the country better counter growing threats from North Korea.In a parliamentary audit, Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

Um Hyun-seong replies to questions from a lawmaker in a parliamentary hearing held at the Navy's headquarters in South Chungcheong Province. (Yonhap)His remarks came in response to a question by Rep. Kim Hack-yong from the ruling Saenuri Party about the argument for the government to build nuclear submarines to trail and keep close tabs on North Korean ballistic missile subs that can pose serious challenges to national security down the line.Pyongyang launched a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) in late August that has been viewed as a success by Seoul.\u00a0\"To have a nuclear submarine, a set of conditions should be considered by the defense ministry,\" Um said without elaborating.Following North Korea's fifth nuclear test and additional missile launches last month, calls have been growing for South Korea to build a nuclear submarine to better deal with evolving nuclear and missile threats by the North.On Friday, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin said it is necessary for Seoul to review the possible development of its own nuclear submarines, citing the rising provocations from Pyongyang.\u00a0Nuclear-powered subs have far greater range and can effectively stay submerged as long as they have nuclear fuel and food.\u00a0As for the possibility of installing the SM-3 missile defense system, which has a range of up to 500 kilometers, in the Aegis destroyers to be operated by the Navy, the defense ministry said the JCS are \"still in consideration\" and had not yet reached a decision.\u00a0He expected the decision to be reached in one to two years.South Korea is seeking to build nine 3,000-ton submarines in three batches as part of its so-called Jangbogo-III project. The move is aimed at building submarines with local technology that can better meet the country's future defense needs.The South Korean military plans to build the first batch of three submarines from 2020 to 2024, and the second batch of three submarines with improved capabilities from 2025 to 2027. It has yet to finalize the details of the plan to build the latest batch of subs.\u00a0(Yonhap)","68":"A potential crisis involving North Korea ranked atop the list of international concerns for the United States in the New Year, according to a Council on Foreign Relations survey.The annual Preventive Priorities Survey put \"a severe crisis in North Korea\" in the Tier 1 category of concerns, along with a potential military confrontation between Russia and NATO; a highly disruptive cyberattack on US critical infrastructure; and a mass casualty terrorist attack on the US homeland.The CFR said in the report that a severe crisis in the North could be \"caused by nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile weapons testing, a military provocation, or internal political instability.The think tank said that it sent the survey to nearly 7,000 US government officials, foreign policy experts, and academics, of whom more than 500 responded. Each was asked to estimate the likelihood and impact on US interests of each of the contingencies, it said.It was believed to be the first time that a North Korea crisis has topped the annual list of international concerns for New Year, though the issue has been classified as a Tier 1 international concern in previous surveys.\"Donald J.

Their common stance is that the current basic law fails to properly reflect social and political changes since 1987, when it was last revised.Adding to the pressure were the Saenuri\u2019s leadership figures, including the party\u2019s Chairman Rep.

The activist had been in a coma ever since a water cannon knocked him down during a massive anti-government demonstration in November last year. While the ruling party and police say there is no clear link between the water cannon and Baek's death, the opposition bloc have criticized the excessive crackdown by the authorities.The investigation proposed by the opposition parties is set to focus on whether the water cannon used against the protester violated any laws, and find those responsible for the alleged excessive force.Amid the controversy, the ruling party said the proposal must be first discussed by the parliament's Legislation and Judiciary Committee.\"The opposition parties are only seeking to boast their power, even as the country is facing tough challenges such as North Korean nukes, problems facing the economy, and typhoon damage,\" Rep.

When we asked third graders a question that had been reviewed for second graders' textbook, less than 30 percent got it correct,\" said Rep.

Alongside the UK, France, Finland and Luxembourg, among others, the Netherlands has one of Europe\u2019s leading startup ecosystems. As a key policy that encourages entrepreneurship, Rutte said the government notifies the amount of tax to be paid by companies five to 10 years ahead. The corporate response to this has been positive, he claimed, as it allows future planning and financial forecast.\u201cThe relative lack of policies has actually freed up creative initiatives,\u201d he underscored, adding that \u201ccreative people don\u2019t like to follow regulations.

Despite its small territory of just over 41,500 square kilometers -- less than half of South Korea -- and a population of 17 million, the Netherlands is a leading global economic powerhouse with the world\u2019s fifth-largest trade volume, one spot ahead of Korea. Last year, the Netherlands invested over $25 billion in Korea as the top investing country in the European Union. The country has strengths in creative industries, advanced technologies and economic reforms. Multinational corporations such as Shell, Philips and Unilever are Dutch enterprises, and 355 Korean corporations are operating in the country.Its advanced agricultural industry -- as the world\u2019s second-largest agricultural exporting economy -- has actively incorporated automation, mobile computing, telecommunications networks, genetic research and development, environmentally friendly production and electric driving systems to prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

(Yonhap)","92":"North Korea's test of a new rocket engine this week shows the communist nation has made real strides in its rocket and missile programs to a point where it could send unmanned probes to the Moon, a US missile expert said Thursday.The North unveiled the massive new engine Tuesday, claiming it successfully conducted a \"ground jet test of a new type high-power engine of a carrier rocket for the geo-stationary satellite.\" It said the engine has a thrust of 80 tons, which is three times the power of the engine used in the North's previous long-range rocket launches.John Schilling, a top aerospace engineer with expertise in the North's missile programs, said the new engine is \"too big and powerful\" for use in intercontinental ballistic missiles the North has been developing, such as KN-08 and KN-14 road-mobile missiles.But it could be used for outer space missions, he said.\"North Korea recently announced it plans to launch rockets to the Moon within the next ten years, along with launching increasingly capable satellites into Earth orbit. This engine would be suitable for launching modest unmanned lunar probes,\" Schilling said in an article in the website 38 North.\"They still have a way to go on the necessary satellite technology, of course, but they are now one step closer to demonstrating a basic operational capability in outer space. We should start thinking about how we might live with a North Korea that has such a capability,\" he said.Even though the new engine isn't right for ICBMs, the North has already demonstrated that it can build large rockets using both solid and high-energy liquid propellants, to their own requirements, Schilling said.\"Whatever missiles North Korea may roll out in coming years, we can no longer expect to be limited to what can be cobbled together from old Russian cold-war leftovers,\" he said.The expert also noted that the North has upgraded its Sohae long-range rocket launch site in the country's northwest to make it possible to launch bigger rockets from there. The new engine might be for a new larger space vehicle, he said.\"Liquid-fuel space launch vehicles typically use more than one engine on the first stage, and North Korean practice so far has been to use four engines,\" Schilling said. \"A launch vehicle using four of these new engines would be about the right size for the upgraded launch pad and gantry tower at Sohae.\"The North is banned from any ballistic missile activity under UN Security Council resolutions over concern that the regime could develop nuclear missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.This week's new engine test came amid heightened worries sparked by the North's fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9 that Pyongyang is making real headway in its nuclear and missile development, and could soon perfect capabilities to threaten the mainland US with nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles.The Sept. 9 test was the most powerful of the five conducted by the North, with its yield estimated at 10 kilotons of TNT, compared with January's 6 kilotons. The previous four tests came in 2006, 2009, 2013 and January this year.By comparison, the Hiroshima bomb was about 15 kilotons.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have projected that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.

Kim Jong-dae of the minor opposition Justice Party, 230 of the Army\u2019s 550 helicopters have been in operation for 30 or more years. The standard lifespan of a helicopter for the South Korean Army is 30 years.Rep. Kim Jong-dae (Yonhap)Kim, the floor spokesman for his party, pointed out that the aged aircraft had not undergone upgrades that could expand their lifespan. \u201cIn such a case, deterioration or erosion of helicopter parts raises the possibility of an accident. Soldiers are forced to carry out operations with this liability,\u201d Kim said.Army data obtained by Kim showed that there have been 9 helicopter-involved accidents in the Army during the past 10 years, killing 14 soldiers.In February, a UH-1 Iroquois chopper crashed, killing three of its passengers. An Army investigation found that the helicopter\u2019s aging hydraulic system had failed, causing a loss of control of the aircraft.The helicopter involved in the accident was brought into the country in 1973, with the model itself being developed in the 1950s.In 2008, another UH-1H helicopter crashed into a mountain and left all seven of its passengers dead. It was later revealed that the helicopter lacked critical devices such as a ground proximity warning system.All 60 of the Army\u2019s UH-1 helicopters are over 30 years old, with the oldest being used in the field since 1966. Of the Army\u2019s 210 MD 500 helicopters, 160 are over 30 years old.Although the Army is gradually replacing the UH-1Hs with locally developed KUH-1 Surion helicopters, this process won\u2019t be complete until 2022. The MD 500s are to be used until 2031.Military officials say lack of budget is preventing them from immediately replacing the aircraft.\u201cThe tendency to allocate most of the budget to offensive weapons has forced the Army to retain equipment that threatens the safety of our soldiers.

In 1951, the system, which was suspended in 1950, was reinstated during the Korean War. Since then, every Korean able-bodied man has been mandated to serve in the military for between 21 and 24 months. In doing so, they constitute the backbone of the armed forces with 640,000 active in duty and 4.3 million as reserve forces. Now, the mandatory military service is being thrust into the spotlight again as some prominent politicians are questioning whether the system reflects new socioeconomic challenges and proposing to replace it with what they see as more modernized voluntary military service. Spearheading these voices is Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the ruling Saenuri Party. The 51-year-old politician, who is also hailed as one of the flag-bearers of the Saenuri Party in advance of the 2016 presidential campaign, said he would adopt the voluntary system if elected president. \u201cThe current mandatory system cannot defend South Korea,\u201d said the governor during a meeting with local reporters Wednesday. \u201cThe solution is to create a strong but small military -- something that young people want to join as opposed to being forced to.\u201dHe laid out a series of options for his initiative: a transformation to a voluntary system by 2022; reduction of the total number of armed forces to 300,000; and offering enlisted soldiers monthly payment of 2 million won ($1,800), roughly equivalent to the monthly wages of low-ranking public workers. His proposal is based on the idea that South Korea\u2019s low birthrate will lead to a shortfall in manpower available for conscription by 2020 -- the year he said Korea would face dramatic declines both in population and consumption.The Ministry of National Defense expects the number of draftees -- mostly in their 20s -- would be reduced from the current 350,000 to 250,000 by 2020. The number is far below the ministry\u2019s goal to secure 520,000 in personnel in accordance with the military reform plan published in 2014. Another reason for an end to the draft is the physical and mental abuse prevalent among military units, said Nam. According to data from the Army in 2015, about 1 in 10 candidates were deemed unfit to serve and the number of those who were dishonorably discharged rose from 1,419 in 2013 to 3,328 in 2014.\u00a0 \u201cMaintaining more than 500,000 Army conscripts requires even those with physical and mental issues to be sent to the military,\u201d said Nam. \u201cIn order to maintain the current level, we have to send all of the draftees with medical conditions to the Army and even extend their service period.\u201d This is not the first time the idea of a voluntary force has made headlines in South Korea. In 2012, Rep Kim Doo-kwan of what is now The Minjoo Party of Korea had vowed to cut in half the number of armed forces to 300,000 if he won the 2012 presidential election. But his proposal was immediately rebuked by political circles worried about two Korea\u2019s armistice condition. Two years later, the issue came to the fore again amid public outrage over the death of a 23-year-old Army private first class, who had suffered from severe assault and abusive treatment at the hands of his comrades in his barracks in 2014. But the idea has often been dismissed by military officials and security experts as unrealistic. The Defense Ministry said earlier this year that the government should take a \u201ccautious\u201d approach to a voluntary system and that cutting personnel to 300,000 is \u201cimpossible\u201d given the threat posed by North Korea. \u201cIt is too early to discuss a voluntary military,\u201d said Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn when asked by lawmakers Tuesday during the interpellation session. The government maintained it should retain the current level of military personnel in the event of ground warfare with North Korea. \u201cA mandatory system is still crucial as the two Koreas are still at war,\u201d said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Security and Defense Forum. \u201cUltimately, the war can end only when infantry troops move in and take control of the battlefield.\u201d He asserted that South Korea must maintain at least 400,000 in armed forces to defend itself against North Korea, which reportedly has a force up to 1.2 million strong -- unless the South has a system in which all able citizens over a certain age can be considered troops and mobilized in a wartime situation, such as countries like Israel. Some experts said that the government cannot afford a voluntary military whose annual cost could range from 4 trillion to 7 trillion won. And the additional cost, they warned, would divert resources from investing more money in developing high-tech military equipment against North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat.\u00a0\u00a0 Shin In-kyun, the president of the Korea Defense Network, said in a local newspaper the voluntary system would cost as much as 10 trillion won because it includes pay raises for all military personnel, including officers, and improvement to equipment. He also warned that there is no ample incentive to attract enough soldiers in the nation where military service is still considered a \u201ctraumatic\u201d experience for many. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government would recruit even half of what they expect under the monthly salary that is being discussed,\u201d he said. Such a voluntary system with low incentives would create a situation in which only the children of poor families would end up shouldering the burden of military service while those of rich families would avoid it, said Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the Saenuri Party, who had chaired the parliamentary defense committee. \u201cFrom the perspective of justice, it is an intolerable system,\u201d said Yoo during his lecture at a college in Seoul earlier this month. \u201cWhile maintaining the draft system, we need to recruit more noncommissioned officers and develop more weapons.\u201d The lawmakers at the National Assembly\u2019s Defense Committee also mostly held skeptical views of the voluntary system. The ruling Saenuri Party and opposition parties alike said that while they acknowledged the need for the system, it is too early to adopt a full-fledged voluntary system. \u201cA voluntary system is a step in the right direction, but not now,\u201d said Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party, chairman of the defense committee. \u201cSouth Korea is still technically at war and voluntary military could push the burden onto low-income and ill-educated families.\u201d Rep. Kim Joong-ro of the People\u2019s Party, a former army general who represents opposition parties on the committee, said the ongoing discussion over the voluntary system amounts to \u201cpopulism\u201d targeting the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI understand the need for the voluntary system, but the current development strikes me as populism,\u201d Kim said. \u201cInstead of a voluntary system, the government should prepare for military reform.\u201dPublic opinion remains split over voluntary military service and results varied depending upon pollsters conducting the survey. A survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter showed on Sep. 8 that 27 percent approved the voluntary system, with about 62 percent opposing the move. Local media outlet Moneytoday\u2019s survey on Sept. 12 showed that some 51 percent approved the step, while about 44 percent opposed it.

It was the strongest ever recorded by the KMA in the Korean Peninsula. Among a total of 423 aftershocks recorded as of Wednesday afternoon since the Sept. 12 quake, most were assessed to be weaker than magnitude 3. Only two aftershocks recorded a magnitude of between 4 and 5, while 15 tremors have ranged from 3 to 4. The historic city of Gyeongju in North Gyeongsang Province is set to be designated as a special disaster zone, which will grant the city state funds to help restore the area. Its residents will receive tax benefits and cuts in utility bills. A 3.5 magnitude earthquake struck Gyeongju on Wednesday morning, two days after a magnitude 4.5 quake shook the nation Monday night. The KMA added that the epicenter of the foreshock in Gyeongju was 0.7 to 0.8 kilometers away from that of the main quake. \u201cWe found out that foreshocks, major quakes and aftershocks were seen as moving in southwestern direction,\u201d said the KMA.\u00a0 Members of a civic environmental group hold a press conference condemning the government\u2018s countermeasures against earthquakes, calling for suspension of the country\u2019s nuclear power plants in front of the Sejong Center for Performing Arts in downtown Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Nearly 90 percent of the aftershocks, including the most powerful ones with a magnitude of 4.0 and over took place with 2.5 kilometers from where the major 5.8 magnitude quake occurred, the KMA said. Nearly 70 percent of the aftershocks took place within two days after the quake rattled the country, with the quakes hitting a depth of 15.2 kilometers on average. \u201cCurrently, it takes 50 seconds to detect earthquakes stronger than 5.0 magnitude and notify relevant agencies and areas of the tremors, but we will reduce it to 7 to 25 seconds,\u201d said the KMA. \u201cIn order to do so, we will increase the number of seismic monitoring facilities from the current 206 to 314 by 2018.\u201d\u201cStarting in November, the KMA will directly notify the public of the occurrence of natural disasters in association with Cell Broadcasting System,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWe believe we can measure the seismic activity within 10 seconds and notify the public within 2 minutes through text messages by 2017.\u201dThe current system of sending alert messages to the public has been criticized for failing to inform them in time. The weather agency sends mobile alert messages in times of natural disasters after going through the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. When the 3.5 magnitude aftershock jolted the country Wednesday, warning messages were sent to the public some 10 minutes after residents felt the shaking. On Monday night, the website of the Public Safety Ministry as well as the weather agency, which provide information on how to evacuate in cases of quakes, also crashed due to heavy traffic. The KMA also said that a team of eight relevant officials will be dispatched to Gyeongju to conduct an on-site investigation from Sept. 20 to March 31 in 2017 to investigate causes and impact of the series of quakes. In regard to the latest earthquakes, President Park Geun-hye ordered a comprehensive overhaul of the country\u2018s national quake response system at a meeting with top aides in the presidential office on Thursday. \u201cIt has been confirmed that the country had several problems in the process of responding to quakes because we have perceived our country as safe from such natural disasters,\u201d she said.\u201cAs it is possible that aftershocks continue to take place, the government should have more prompt and accurate readiness to promote the public safety,\u201d she said. Relevant ministries and state-run agencies are scrambling to assess, prevent and minimize the damage of quakes. According to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, it will revise relevant acts so that special subsidy tax of the interior ministry, the education ministry and the public safety ministry can be used to reinforce public facilities to make them more earthquake-resistant. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced Thursday that it will inspect all major social infrastructure including bridges, tunnels and airports in the quake-stricken southeastern region. A team of more than 420 officials from relevant state-run agencies will be put on the field to inspect the safety of nearly 6,000 public facilities in the region by the end of this year. It also aims to make express trains, expressways and bridges earthquake-resistant by 2018, ordinary trains by 2019 and intake towers by 2020. The ministry has already announced plans to revise construction codes to require all new structures that are two-stories high or higher to be earthquake-proof. The Korea electric Power Corporation will also raise the level of safety of electric facilities as well as nuclear reactors by evaluating its ability to endure quakes in the face of the series of quakes.

Joo Kwang-Deok of the ruling Saenuri Party, 86 percent of the cyberattacks conducted by Pyongyang on the South Korean military in 2015 involved using emails.Last year, Seoul detected 74 cases of North Korean cyberattack using email, with 12 involving malicious codes.\u00a0Rep. Joo Kwang-Deok of the ruling Saenuri Party (Yonhap)North Korea also made 43 attacks through July this year, with email hacking accounting for 27 cases, the data showed.Joo said the figures are significant as North Korea previously focused on attacking webpages, adding that Pyongyang is apparently expanding its efforts to gain access to confidential military data. (Yonhap)","97":"The number of crimes committed by foreigners in South Korea increased over the past few years, a ruling party lawmaker said Wednesday, with Chinese nationals being responsible for roughly 40 percent of the total.According to the data compiled by Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the Saenuri Party, the number of crimes involving foreign perpetrators came to 46,994 last year, rising sharply from the 32,364 tallied in 2012. The figure also came to 25,570 in the January-June period of 2016.By nationality, Chinese citizens were involved in 45.8 percent of all cases of crime involving foreign nationals in 2015, also up from the 43.7 percent posted in 2012.The data also showed that the number of sexual offenses by foreigners reached 983 in 2015, nearly doubling from the 493 posted in 2012.Kim said South Korean authorities must come up with solutions to tackle the rising number of crimes, citing the stabbing of an elderly woman by a Chinese man on the country's resort island of Jeju last week. (Yonhap)","98":"The United States on Wednesday sent two armed strategic bombers to South Korea, the US Forces Korea said, in the latest move to demonstrate Washington's security commitment to its Asian ally and warn against additional North Korean provocations.One of the two B-1B Lancer bombers landed at Osan Air Base. The other flew over the base in Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of Seoul, and returned to US Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, the USFK said.The flyby comes only a week after a pair of B-1B Lancers flew over South Korea days after the North conducted its fifth nuclear test. The move is aimed at reaffirming Washington's commitment to providing Seoul with extended deterrence amid Pyongyang's growing missile and nuclear threats.\"The bond between the United States and the Republic of Korea is ironclad and the strength of that commitment will not be shaken by North Korea's aggressive behavior,\" 7th Air Force Commander Lieutenant Gen. Thomas W. Bergeson said in a statement released by the USFK. \"What we are showing today is just one tool we have to choose from a wide array of options. The alliance grows stronger every day and we remain prepared to defend and to preserve the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region.\" The Combined Air Forces of the two allies maintain close information sharing and a robust joint operational capability, said Lt. Gen. Lee Wang-keun, South Korea's Air Force Operations Commander. \"Should the enemy provoke us once again, the South Korea-US combined forces will respond and eliminate their will and capability to fight,\" he warned. It remains uncertain how long the Lancer will stay in Korea and whether the strategic bomber will be open to the public. The 7th Air Force of the US is scheduled to hold its \"Air Power Day\" event this weekend and open its base to the public. The B-1B, capable of reaching the peninsula from Guam in just two hours, is one of the US military\u2019s three major multi-role and long-range bombers along with the B-52 Stratofortress and B-2 Spirit.\u00a0 The Lancer, which has the ability to fly very low and faster while carrying a large payload, represents a major upgrade in US long-range bombing capability over the B-52. There is a possibility that the US will send B-52s and B-2s to Korea as well.\u00a0 Pyongyang has continued such provocative acts as nuclear tests and long-range rocket launches despite a wide range of UN-led sanctions. On Jan. 10, four days after the North's fourth nuclear test, the US flew a B-52 bomber over South Korea. The B-52 can carry nuclear missiles and \"bunker buster\" bombs that are capable of destroying the North's underground facilities. (Yonhap)","99":"A new rocket engine that North Korea claims to have successfully tested this week would be powerful enough to range the continental United States if it has the capability to put a satellite into orbit as claimed by Pyongyang, a top US commander said Tuesday.The North claimed earlier Tuesday that it successfully conducted a \"ground jet test of a new type high-power engine of a carrier rocket for the geo-stationary satellite.\" It said the \"single engine\" has a thrust of 80 tons, which is three times the power of the engine used in the North's previous long-range rocket launches.The claim, if confirmed, would represent big progress in the North's efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US The announcement also raises concern Pyongyang is preparing for yet another long-range rocket launch after a successful launch in February.(Yonhap)\"There was news of a test of a new, very large rocket engine, a rocket engine that he (the North) said would be capable of going to the geosynchronous orbit in space. If it has that capability, it has the capability to reach the United States. So I'm very concerned about that,\" Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten said during a Senate hearing to confirm his nomination as commander of the US Strategic Command.The State Department urged the North to stop such menacing actions that \"destabilize the region and threaten international peace and security.\" It also urged Pyongyang to take concrete steps toward fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.\"We call on responsible stakeholders to join us in making clear to Pyongyang that further provocations are unacceptable and to consider what steps we can take together to raise the costs to Pyongyang of continuing to threaten us and the region,\" State Department spokesperson Katina Adams said.The incoming strategic commander said the North is one of \"the most likely threats and the most concerning.\"\"Russia is the most dangerous threat. China is a close second.But the most likely threats and the most concerning are North Korea and then Iran, because North Korea is very unpredictable,\" Hyten said. \"It's hard to tell exactly what they're going to do.\"The commander also said the North will learn from failures and ultimately perfect its missile capabilities.\"When we started flying missiles and we started building those capabilities, we had failure after failure after failure and we ended up getting there. What concerns me most is they will get there. They're going to get there,\" Hyten said. \"Once they have those capabilities, what are they going to do with them? That's my biggest concern. If I'm confirmed as commander of STRATCOM, that will be at the top of my list to figure out how we best respond to that threat at hand,\" he said.Hyten said one of his key focuses as strategic commander would be to \"deter our adversaries and assure our allies that they are defended by the capabilities of the United States.\" He also said that the US should do more in terms of missile defense.\"I'm a big believer in missile defense. I think we're doing a lot, but I think we need to do more,\" he said. \"I think the force is sized correctly today. I have some concerns about the size of that force in the future. (Yonhap)","100":"North Korea appears to have finished extracting plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, gaining up to four more nuclear weapons worth of plutonium, a US research institute said Tuesday.The Institute for Science and International Studies (ISIS) said that satellite imagery taken of the North's Yongbyon nuclear complex between July and August shows little activity at the North's nuclear reprocessing plant, compared with brisk activity earlier this year when reprocessing was believed to be under way.\"The recent campaign to separate plutonium at the Radiochemical Plant may be finished,\" ISIS said in a report. \"An earlier Institute report estimated that North Korea could have separated about 5.5 to 8 kilograms of plutonium during this campaign, which is roughly enough for 1 to 4 nuclear weapons.\"The institute said that imagery also shows continued activity at the complex, such as vehicle movements, but the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, the main source of plutonium, appears to be operating sporadically.The \"imagery dated August 26, 2016 showed no outward signs of full power, such as extensive water discharge into the nearby river or steam venting from the reactor's turbine structure,\" it said.\"Our assessment is that the reactor has operated intermittently or at low power since mid-2014. Based on the recent imagery, we do not detect evidence of consistent operation at full reactor power in July and August 2016,\" the institute said. \"Although North Korea has conducted extensive renovations of the reactor during the last several years, including importing equipment and materials from abroad, the reactor's operation may remain sporadic,\" it said.The institute said that construction of a new light water reactor at Yongbyon appears to be still on going. But once completed, the new reactor will be a bigger source of weapons-grade plutonium for the North than the 5-megawatt reactor. \"Given the importance of plutonium to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, another question remains whether North Korea will seek to boost plutonium production at these two reactors by getting the smaller one to work better and starting the larger one,\" it said. (Yonhap)","101":"A lawmaker who bolted from the ruling Saenuri Party said Wednesday he is concerned about the security stance of Moon Jae-in, a leading presidential contender from the opposition bloc.\"Just looking at his stance on North Korea or on national security, many people will become extremely anxious,\" Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the tentatively named New Conservative Party for Reform said during an interview with MBC Radio. Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the tentatively named New Conservative Party for Reform (Yonhap)Moon, a former head of the main opposition Democratic Party, is currently running neck and neck with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in public polls among potential candidates as the next president. Yoo is also included in the list, although his approval rating hovers in the single digits.Yoo said Moon's protests against the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system in the country lead to doubts about his views on national security. While South Korea claims the battery will improve the country's defense capabilities against the North, the opposition bloc has been claiming it will only lead to unwanted diplomatic tension with Beijing.Moon also has been under fire for allegedly playing a part in contacting Pyongyang and getting feedback that was then reflected in Seoul's decision-making process on a UN vote, Yoo added.A memoir by a former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon released earlier this year claimed Seoul abstained from voting on the 2007 UN resolution on North Korea's human rights after hearing Pyongyang's views, and that Moon was involved in contacting the North.Yoo also cited Moon's remark where he said he plans to visit North Korea before flying to Washington if he becomes president.Concerning speculation he does not always see things in the same way as Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who is a major shareholder in the new party, Yoo stressed that while there are minor differences, he strongly trusts Kim.The lawmaker then said he hopes Rep. Na Kyung-won of Saenuri will join the new party. Na earlier claimed she would leave Saenuri but later said she needed more time to determine the sincerity of the new party.\"Na said she will join the party in January, but I understand there are some different media reports,\" Yoo pointed out.The first group of 29 lawmakers, along with another who left Saenuri earlier, vowed to establish a new party Tuesday, expressing discontent with the loyalists of President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached earlier this month over corruption.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","102":"A group of North Korean workers in Russia clashed with their Russian counterparts at a shipyard in Vladivostok over construction materials, a US-based news media report said Tuesday.According to Radio Free Asia, dozens of North Korean workers were seen engaging in a fight with Russian laborers in a video clip released by the Russia's Far East news portal Deita.The 26-second video showed the North Koreans hurling abuses at the Russians with some strangling and kicking them. The incident occurred last Friday.An official at the dockyard said the North Koreans employed by a local construction company clashed with Russian laborers when the latter attempted to move materials that were set aside days earlier.\"Such tussles occur from time to time,\" the official said.

The meeting came as Washington and Beijing have been negotiating fresh sanctions on Pyongyang.\"Both leaders condemned North Korea's Sept. 9 nuclear test and resolved to strengthen coordination in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, including by invigorating cooperation in the United Nations Security Council and in law enforcement channels on North Korea,\" the statement said.The statement appeared to suggest active Chinese cooperation in efforts to punish the North.Cooperation from China is key to putting together any meaningful punishment for the North as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the UN Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel to the impoverished North. China, the North's last-remaining major ally, has been reluctant to use its influence over Pyongyang for fear that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and hurt Chinese national interests.Analysts say that China often increased pressure on the North in the past, especially when Pyongyang defied international appeals and carried out nuclear tests and other provocative acts, but China never went as far as to cause real pain to the North.

According to the index, Busan showed $20.45 billion of total GDP at risk, followed by Daegu ($13.50 billion), Incheon ($10.59 billion), Daejeon ($9.86 billion) and Gwangju ($8.66 billion).The report said the South Korean capital could be hit hard by a windstorm, mainly due to its geographical location in the northwest Pacific typhoon belt.By threat type, a windstorm was the highest risk factor for Seoul, with potential economic loss calculated at $44.68 billion, followed by an oil price shock ($12.72 billion), market crash ($12.63 billion), flood ($9.83 billion), pandemic ($7.61 billion) and drought ($6.08 billion).Among 301 cities, Seoul was also the third most exposed city to potential losses from natural threats, including flood and drought. Seoul showed the world\u2019s highest exposure to drought, due to the fact that the Korean Peninsula suffered its worst drought in the past century in 2012.But despite South Korea\u2019s strongest earthquake last week, the report calculated the potential losses from earthquakes at zero. In terms of man-made economic threats, the report said that as South Korea lacks oil and gas resources, Seoul was vulnerable to a market crash and an oil price shock, placing the country in third for highest exposure to an oil price shock in the world.

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State John Kerry (Yonhap)\"The ministers noted that the DPRK's flagrant disregard for multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions expressly prohibiting its ballistic missile and nuclear programs requires even stronger international pressure on the regime,\" said a joint statement adopted at the meeting. DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \"North Korea's provocative actions are further deepening its isolation and undermining the needs of its people, who suffer greatly at the hands of the regime. In this regard, the three countries are working closely with partners at the United Nations and in other fora to pressure the DPRK,\" the statement said.It said that Kerry reiterated \"steadfast\" US commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan, \"including the commitment to provide extended deterrence, backed by the full range of its nuclear and conventional defense capabilities.\"Yun said after the meeting that it is the first time in 10 years that the foreign ministers of the three countries have adopted a joint statement, an indication of how seriously the three countries view the North's provocations. During Sunday's meeting, the three top diplomats explored ways to work together to ensure that all countries fully and effectively implement all their obligations and commitments under the most recent UN Security Council sanctions resolution on the North, the statement said.They also \"discussed the important work currently taking place in the Security Council to further sanction North Korea and considered other possible measures of their own, in particular ways to further restrict revenue sources for the DPRK's missile and nuclear programs, including through illicit activities,\" it said.The three sides reaffirmed they remain open to credible negotiations with the North aimed at verifiable denuclearization of the North, and pledged to continue to work together to draw international attention to Pyongyang's human rights violations, the statement said.\"What we see is a looming perfect storm that may not only pounce on Northeast Asia but sweep over the entire world,\" Yun said at the start of the talks, calling the North's nuclear and missile programs a \"time bomb\" and a threat to the world.Kerry urged the North to freeze its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table.\"The immediate need is for them to freeze where they are, to agree to freeze and not to engage in any more provocative actions, not engage in more testing, particularly in order to bring countries together and to begin a serious negotiation about the future,\" he said.Kerry also said that the US remains \"deeply committed\" to the defense of South Korea and Japan and to \"rolling back the provocative, reckless behavior\" of the North. He also warned that provocations will only deepen the North's isolation.Cooperation from China is key to putting together any meaningful punishment for the North as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the UN Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel to the impoverished North. China, the North's last-remaining major ally, has been reluctant to use its influence over Pyongyang for fear that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and hurt Chinese national interests.Analysts say that China often increased pressure on the North in the past too, especially when Pyongyang defied international appeals and carried out nuclear tests and other provocative acts, but China never went as far as to cause real pain to the North. (Yonhap)","110":"The government and the ruling Saenuri Party on Sunday held an emergency meeting and decided to review whether to designate the quake-hit southeastern city of Gyeongju as a disaster area to provide it with state funding for recovery works.They also agreed on the need to strengthen safety measures against earthquakes and prepare detailed guidelines to measure the damage of public facilities, houses and cultural assets. They also discussed ways to support the citizens of Gyeongju from any psychological impact.Gyeongju city officials Sunday work on covering damaged roofs of houses with nets and tents, after the area suffered from a 5.8 magnitude earthquake last week. (Yonhap)The meeting at the National Assembly was attended by the party leadership including Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, along with the ministers for agriculture, food and rural affairs, vice minister for public safety and the head of the Korea Meteorological Administration.The government and the ruling party agreed to firstly determine the extent of the earthquake damage in Gyeongju by sending a joint investigation team to the site, prior to the designation.The capital of ancient Silla (57 B.C. to 935) was hit by a 5.8-magnitude earthquake Monday with the tremors felt throughout most of South Korea. The KMA said the quake was the strongest since 1978, raising alarms over the safety of the country that had been previously considered \u201cearthquake-free.\u201dOn Saturday, officials at the North Gyeongsang Provincial Government and Gyeongju City Council requested the central government to designate the city as a disaster area to cope with the damage with the help of a fund of 5 billion won ($4.4 million).An area with a calculated loss of 7.5 billion won can be designated as a special disaster area, according to Vice Minister Lee Sung-ho of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Sunday that it would complete safety tests on all of 24 units of the country\u2019s nuclear plants by the end of 2018. Tests for the Kori and Wolsong nuclear plants located near the epicenter in Gyeongju will be completed by the end of next year.Korea Nuclear Power Co., operator of the country\u2019s nuclear plants, said last week that despite two tremors in Gyeongju, the plant near the city and other plants in the adjacent areas were fully functional without error, producing electricity as per normal.\u00a0 Officials said the planned safety tests are to make sure the power plants are built to withstand an earthquake with a magnitude of up to 7.0.Currently, two units at the Kori nuclear plants and four units at the Wolsong nuclear plants have ceased operation due to maintenance and accident-prevention checks. There has been rising concern about current regulations on earthquake-resistant construction. According to Rep. Chong Jong-sup of the Saenuri Party, South Korea lacks specific and detailed earthquake-resistant construction regulations for safe building designs. \u201cThe government should make earthquake-proof construction design mandatory for all constructors in case of building or remodeling, and establish a legal basis to strengthen construction safety for buildings without earthquake-proof design,\u201d said Rep. Chong.He said he is preparing a revision bill to improve the current Act on the Preparation for Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions as well as the Building Act. The enforcement decree of the Building Act, which took effect in 1988, states that buildings six stories or higher with total floor area of 100,000 square meters must be built following earthquake-proof designs.In 2015, the legislation was revised to target buildings three stories or higher with an area of at least 500 square meters. Earlier this year, buildings two stories or higher came under the law to have more buildings made using earthquake-proof methods.Yet the lack of earthquake-proof facilities across the nation have been considered problematic.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport\u2019s data, in 2015, just 26.7 percent of buildings three stories or over 13 meters high in Seoul were built based on earthquake-proof designs. The total figure across the country was slightly above 34 percent.Meanwhile, seismic experts have also raised concerns that the Korean Peninsula is no longer safe from strong shock waves and may experience severe earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.The Korean Peninsula was previously considered safe from earthquakes, as it is located away from the Pacific seismic belt \u201cRing of Fire.\u201dAccording to the KMA, however, small and mid-sized earthquakes have occurred over the past three decades. A total of 1,212 earthquakes were detected since 1978, and six of them have been earthquakes with a magnitude exceeding 5.0.Oh Chang-hwan, a professor of earth environment at Chonbuk National University said that the Korean Peninsula has been experiencing a 400-year cycle of 7.0 magnitude tremors since mid-1600.Along with the active fault located by the east coast of the peninsula, experts added that strong tremors that originate from nearby epicenters can also cause extensive damages.\u201cWhen strong shock waves are detected in nearby countries such as Japan, it may add on to the shock waves felt by the Korean Peninsula,\u201d said Hong tae-kyung a professor of earth system science at Yonsei University. \u201cEarthquakes of magnitude over 7.0 can create more secondary shocks in neighboring areas, which last from five to a maximum of eight years,\u201d he added.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","111":"The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea announced Sunday it is uniting with the non-parliamentary Democratic Party to rise as an influential countervailing force against the current administration ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\u201cOur integration is a declaration of hope and the launch of a grand march toward administrative change by overcoming the division and desperation felt by the people who are losing hope as they stand on the edge of life,\u201d said Minjoo Party chief Rep.

Thae Yong-ho, who was the No. 2 official at Pyongyang\u2019s Embassy in London, held his first news conference since Seoul revealed his arrival here in August. With the time frame, Kim is currently on the path toward nuclear development and will never abandon the program, even in return for 10 trillion won ($8.5 billion), he said.\u00a0 Former North Korean diplomat Thae Yong-ho on Tuesday speaks at a press conference where he described the reclusive state under the rule of Kim Jong-un. (Yonhap)\u201cNorth Korea sees the end of 2017 as the best time on the calculation that the US and South Korea would be unable to take physical, military steps to halt its nuclear development because of their own internal political events, the presidential election and government transitions,\u201d Thae said. \u201cHow and whether to make Kim give up the nuclear program now is not about the incentive and its quality and quantity. As long as he rules, North Korea will never ever give up nuclear weapons even in return for $1 trillion or $10 trillion.\u201d Thae deems Kim\u2019s parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development -- known as the byongjin line -- to be a cover for its essential nuclear priority, saying the economic part was added only to \u201cdeceive\u201d the people and the world.After achieving bombs, the regime will likely attempt to restart talks with the new administrations in Seoul and Washington to acquire their recognition of the North as a nuclear state, he noted. \u201cFrom the North Korean point of view, there are two weak spots in the liberal democratic system. First, any new government in the US and the South, whether it is conservative or progressive, will try a fresh approach to the North, and second, with a government change, there will be a change in the people who drive the North Korea policy,\u201d Thae said. \u201cWith the incoming governments, the North will seek to be accepted as a nuclear state, proposing a moratorium in the nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions and a freeze of South Korea-US joint military drills.\u201d Thae, who served in countries including Denmark and Sweden, harbored the desire to flee to the affluent, democratic South while accessing outside information relatively freely as a diplomat. He was adamant that the Kim dynasty has \u201cno future\u201d and that its instability will only deepen in the face of the young ruler\u2019s unabated reign of terror, international sanctions and the influx of South Korean culture. \u201cThe Kim regime may look solid on the surface but it\u2019s decaying inside,\u201d Thae said. \u201cMany North Korean people including the elites like myself are living an opportunistic life -- they chant hail to Kim Jong-un during the daytime and watch South Korean films and dramas at night, under blankets.\u201d He also called for fellow countrymen to escape the oppressive homeland and lauded other defectors as \u201cunification fighters and slave liberators,\u201d vowing to work for the two nations\u2019 reintegration. \u201cNorth Koreans, Kim Jong-un will collapse like a wet wall when you stand up and protest against him,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s live freely in a unified country, not live in fears. \u2026 It\u2019s your chance to proudly tell your children in the future that you cut the chain of slavery.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","115":"North Korea's nuclear test site is ready for at least three more blasts at any time, and the communist nation could conduct one to mark next month's anniversary of its first nuclear test, a US expert said Tuesday.Joel Wit, chief editor of the website 38 North, made the remark in an op-ed piece in the New York Times, stressing that the next US administration should launch a new diplomatic initiative to curb Pyongyang's dangerously accelerating nuclear and missile programs.(Yonhap)\"Satellite photos of North Korea's nuclear test site indicate that at least three more tests are possible at a moment's notice,\"Wit said. \"Since North Koreans often celebrate important dates with spectacular shows, the approaching 10th anniversary of its first nuclear detonation on Oct. 9 might be the perfect occasion.\"The North's fifth nuclear test last week and a series of missile launches in recent months show that Pyongyang may be able to deploy more powerful nuclear weapons and more dangerous delivery systems more quickly than previously expected, Wit said.\"Last year, researchers at the institute where I work concluded that by 2020 North Korea could field an intercontinental ballistic missile able to reach the United States. But if Pyongyang tests the missile that has appeared in recent military parades, it could be sooner,\" he said.\"The simple hydrogen bomb the North Koreans were expected to have by 2020 now may be ready and mounted on a missile earlier,\" he added.Wit, a former State Department negotiator with North Korea, said that the latest developments should \"put to rest the misconceptions that have driven the United States' failed North Korea policy, especially the idea that China, Pyongyang's closest ally, will solve the problem.\"\"Beijing would certainly prefer that Kim Jong-un give up his nuclear weapons. And the Chinese do occasionally use their economic ties with North Korea to pressure Pyongyang. But China's overriding priority will continue to be keeping North Korea as a stable buffer against American influence in South Korea,\" Wit said.\u00a0\"No amount of cajoling from Washington will cause China to squeeze North Korea with enough sanctions that it will give up its weapons or risk the government's collapse,\" he said. \"The next administration must recognize that the United States, not China, is the indispensable nation when it comes to dealing with North Korea.\"Wit also said the new administration should take all necessary measures to protect allies, even if it means angering China, such as the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system. It also should tighten sanctions while recognizing that sanctions won't have the same effect they had no Iran, he said.\"A successful strategy will have to include a new diplomatic initiative aimed at persuading the North to first stop expanding its arsenal and then to eventually reduce and dismantle its weapons,\" Wit said.Addressing the North's security concerns is a key element in persuading the North, he said.\u00a0Temporarily suspending or modifying US-South Korea joint military exercises, which the North have denounced as preparations for invasion, could be one of the short-term measures to address Pyongyang's security concerns, he said, adding that long-term measures include replacing the Korean War armistice with a permanent peace agreement.Economic reasons may motivate the North to consider denuclearization, Wit said.\"As the Obama administration winds down, little can be done to change policy at this point. Moreover, the North Koreans are unlikely to be responsive to new initiatives since they know that the next American administration will have its own approach,\" Wit said.\u00a0\"The first hundred days in office will be critical for the next American president. If a window is open to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, it may not stay open for long,\" he said.

South Korea does not lie on any fault lines and has been relatively untouched by serious seismic activities compared with neighboring Japan.Ko Yun-hwa, who heads the Korea Meteorological Administration, said the Gyeongju earthquake is over.Ko Yun-hwa, head of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) (Yonhap)\"The effect of the quake has effectively ended,\" the official said during a meeting attended by government policymakers and lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party. \"But earthquakes of magnitudes higher than 6 could happen in the future.\"Ko, however, made clear that South Korea is still safe from larger quakes.The meteorological chief also said the aftershock of Monday's earthquake may continue for a few more days, adding the KMA will continue to keep a watchful eye on the matter.The official then said the cause of the earthquake remains controversial, with some citing the massive quake that struck Japan in March 2011 affecting the Korean Peninsula. (Yonhap)","117":"North Korea is capable of building seven nuclear warheads a year in addition to the existing stockpile of fissile material for some 20 bombs, and is expected to master the capability to fly nuclear missiles to the US in a decade, a top US nuclear scientist said Monday.Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor known for having a first-hand look at North Korea's uranium-enrichment facility during his 2010 visit, made the remark in an article to the website 38 North, calling for diplomatic efforts, rather than sanctions, to curb Pyongyang's runaway nuclear and missile programs.\"This test must be viewed with great concern, not for any specific capabilities it may have demonstrated, but as part of this enormous buildup of North Korea's nuclear arsenal,\" Hecker said, referring to the North's fifth nuclear test.\"Five tests conducted over a ten-year period, sufficiently spaced that the test results can inform the next test, are deeply alarming,\" he said. \"What are the greatest threats from the rapidly expanding North Korean nuclear program? Left unchecked, Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or so.\"\u00a0(Yonhap)Hecker said the North is believed to be capable of producing seven nuclear bombs worth of fissile material a year at the Yongbyon nuclear complex -- one bomb worth of plutonium from its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and six bombs worth of highly enriched uranium.\"With the two successful nuclear tests this year, we must assume that the DPRK has designed and demonstrated nuclear warheads that can be mounted on some of its short-range and perhaps medium-range missiles. Its ability to field an ICBM fitted with a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the United States is still a long way off, perhaps 5 to 10 years, but likely doable if the program is unconstrained,\" he said.What's more troubling for now is that its recent nuclear and missile successes may give Pyongyang a false sense of confidence and dramatically change regional security dynamics, Hecker said.\"The likely ability of the DPRK to put nuclear weapons on target anywhere in South Korea and Japan and even on some US assets in the Pacific greatly complicates the regional military picture.That situation would be exacerbated if Pyongyang decides to field tactical nuclear weapons as its arsenal expands and its confidence in its nuclear arsenal grows,\" he said.The professor also said that the more the North has nuclear bombs, the difficult it is to secure them in the event of internal turmoil or a chaotic transition. In addition, a financially desperate leadership of the North may risk the sale of fissile materials or other nuclear assets, perhaps to non-state actors, he said.\"So, what to do? The latest nuclear test demonstrates conclusively that attempting to sanction the DPRK into submission and waiting for China to exert leverage over Pyongyang's nuclear program do not work,\" Hecker said. \"Increasing sanctions and adding missile defenses in South Korea to that mix will also not suffice and make China even less likely to cooperate. What's missing is diplomacy as much as Washington may find it repugnant to deal with the Kim regime,\" he said. (Yonhap)","118":"South Korean experts said Monday the country remains relatively safe from strong earthquakes that can lead to serious damage and major causalities, although expressing concerns that the frequency of tremors that are being felt felt by people have increased over the past few years.On Monday, a record-breaking earthquake was detected in the southern region near Gyeongju, which lies 371 kilometers southeast of Seoul. South Korea's meteorological agency said the 5.8-magnitude earthquake was strong enough to be felt throughout most parts of the country, even causing some people to evacuate buildings. The quake was preceded by a 5.1-magnitude tremor detected earlier in the same general location south of Gyeongju.\"The latest earthquake seems to be linked to the massive quake that struck Japan in March 2011,\" said Chi Heon-cheol, a researcher at Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) said, adding there has been a series of aftershocks of that major earthquake not only in the island nation but around the Korean Peninsula.South Korea's meteorological agency reports on the location of the record-strength quake that rocked the country on Sept. 12. (Yonhap)\"Despite most earthquakes not being too dangerous, it is still worrisome that the numbers of such shocks have been rising,\" Chi adding that number of tremors being detected throughout the country is higher than previously anticipated.The researcher said the latest earthquake observed was caused by the strike-slip fault, adding that a release of energy from a side of the fault led to the quake felt across the country.Chi, however, ruled out the possibility that the kinds of tremors detected this time can lead up to a major earthquake that can cause serious damage.\"There are no possibilities,\" Chi claimed. \"The earthquakes observed Monday night are nothing new for the country, and there were previous cases of tremors hitting the same area.\"Although there can be earthquakes under 5.5 magnitude down the road, the overall geological structure in and around South Korea is not conducive to a major earthquake,\" the KIGAM researcher stressed.Reflecting this view Son Moon, a professor of geology at Pusan National University said the latest earthquake was caused by the well known Yangsan fault zone that has shown activity in the past. \"It marks the first time that an earthquake took place on the fault zone since 1978,\" the scholar said. He claimed that the fault area in the zone is not like those that affect Japan, which have been cited for causing serious damage.Son added Monday's earthquake did not indicate that South Korea will face a stronger shock in the near future, although the country still needs to pay more attention to the safety of nuclear reactors in the region.\"As there are nuclear reactors and radioactive waste disposal facilities in Gyeongju, we need to be more cautious,\" Son said. He then said that while no significant damage is expected from a magnitude-5.1 earthquake, buildings without proper quake-proof design can collapse when a magnitude 5.5 or higher quake strikes.Hong Tae-hyung, a professor at Yonsei University, meanwhile, said more studies are needed to be done to better gauge potential earthquakes that can occur in and around South Korea.\"The Gyeongju earthquake was the strongest one ever recorded in the country,\" Hong said, pointing out that the latest tremor can be considered a \"major\" seismic event.\"The aftershocks of a major earthquake show a repetitive pattern of expansion,\" the academician said. \"Monday's earthquake shows that the country is in an expanding phase, which can lead to the number of earthquakes rising.\"Earthquake experts said the latest tremor usurped the previous record posted in Jan. 8, 1980, when a 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck North Pyongan Province of North Korea. On July 5, South Korea also experienced a magnitude 5 earthquake in the water only 52 kilometers off its southeast coast not far from the industrial city of Ulsan.In a previous research, Hong forecast that a magnitude-7 artificial earthquake in North Korea, caused by an underground nuclear detonation can result in the eruption of Mount Paektu along the North Korea-China border.

The ruling Saenuri Party called it a regrettable accident that occurred as police were carrying out their duties. The hearing to find facts and evidence surrounding the use of water cannons came 304 days after Baek fell into a coma last November during a rally in central Seoul due to a water cannon blast that was mixed with tear gas. He was attempting to bring down police bus barricades with ropes.Brought in for questioning as key witnesses were former National Police Agency Chief Kang Sin-myeong and Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency Chief Goo Eun-soo, who have been under criticism for ordering riot police to deploy the water cannons during the overnight rally.Park Sun-rye (right), wife of farmer Baek Nam-ki, and his daughter Baek Dora-ji (left), listen to ex-police chief Kang Sin-myeong\u2019s testimony during a parliamentary hearing held at the National Assembly, Monday. YonhapThe opposition lawmakers quizzed Kang over his refusal to apologize to Baek\u2019s family.\u201cIt is not appropriate to apologize just because a person is injured or dead in a situation where specific facts are not confirmed,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a former police chief, I will take due legal responsibility and make an apology if there is a judiciary decision.\u201d Kang, along with six other police officers are currently under prosecutorial investigation.He also justified the police decision to deploy water cannons, citing the need to keep public order and dismantle what he called illegal and violent protests. \u201cProtestors prepared illegal protest tools. The use of water cannons was the last resort to protect the unarmed police,\u201d he said, citing 113 police officers who were injured during the protest. He added that no one apologized or expressed regret over those injuries. \u201cI believe that this society has legal systems and procedures for the public to express their opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cViolent protests occur because bad practices to solve problems by violence still exist.\u201d Videos played by opposition lawmakers showed the water cannon continued to aim at the farmer, even after he had collapsed, with those surrounding him staggering due to the water cannon\u2019s blast. Other videos played by ruling party lawmakers showed protestors using metal sticks and ropes to pull down police bus barricades. Rep. Park Nam-choon of the opposition Minjoo Party raised allegations of police attempting to hide or manipulate facts. He pointed out that seven water cannons were in use, according to CCTV footage, instead of five as indicated in the police report. Two current police officers, surnamed Choi and Han, who were in charge of using the water cannons at the scene during the rally, gave statements behind a curtain to conceal their identities. Rep. Park Ju-min of the Minjoo Party criticized the police officers for loosely managing the life-threatening device. \u201cWhen your sight was restricted and when you can only assume the distance (between the water cannons and protestors) and the devices\u2019 water pressure, can you still say that you can properly use the water cannons in such a situation?\u201d asked Park. The police officer, surnamed Choi, refused to answer at first, but later conceded that it was impossible. \u201cWe saw the situation (of protestors being hit by the water cannons) through the CCTV, but our sight was limited due to the low quality of the monitors inside the water cannons,\u201d said Choi. \u201cWe did not target a person.

Kang Seok-ho of the Saenuri Party said, \u201cIf there had not been illegal rallies, there would not have been any water cannons or violent acts. To root out illegal rallies, police should take stronger measures.\u201d Baek Dora-ji, the daughter of the farmer who remains unconscious, criticized what she saw as the government\u2019s violent oppression of protests and its inaction to bring justice for her father. \u201cDoctors said it is rarely possible for my father to regain consciousness,\u201d Baek said. \u201cThere was no apology from anyone from the government. We don\u2019t know what is going on with the investigation.\u201dWhile seven police officials including Kang are under investigation, more than 1,200 protestors were taken into custody on charges of violence during the rally. Han Sang-kyun, a leader of the nation\u2019s second-largest umbrella union, was sentenced to five years in prison for leading the rally.The opposition lawmakers also took issue with the uncooperative attitude of police, citing the law enforcement agency\u2019s refusal to submit an internal inspection report including statements from relevant police officers on the incident. While the ruling party lawmakers said the disclosure of the report will influence the ongoing investigation into the case, the opposition lawmakers demanded the report be turned in before further questioning witnesses. Before the hearing began, Rep. Hwang Young-cheol of the ruling Saenuri Party expressed discomfort over the rival party leaders\u2019 decision to hold the parliamentary hearing without consulting other members of the Safety and Public Administration Parliamentary Committee.Following months-long wrangling in the parliament, the leadership of the ruling and opposition parties agreed to launch a hearing on the farmer\u2019s collapse in exchange for passing an extra budget bill in\u00a0early September.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","120":"North Korea\u2019s fifth and strongest nuclear test is fueling fierce debate among political parties here over whether South Korea should shift away from its decades-old non-nuclear commitment for self-defense. Ranking members of the ruling Saenuri Party are stepping up demands that the government consider seeking measures equivalent to obtaining nukes. Their calls, officially denied by the government, are joined by some of the opposition members but are also met with criticism from both within and outside the party for being unrealistic and dangerous.Since joining the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1975, South Korea has been banned from acquiring nuclear weapons. The government reiterated Monday that it would neither seek nuclear armament nor push for the redeployment of a US tactical nuclear weapon in South Korea. Earlier on Thursday, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said \u201cthere is a limitation\u201d to nuclear armament. Defense Minister Han Min-koo (right) on Monday attends the meeting for nuclear armament at the National Assembly along with the Saenuri Party\u2019s lawmakers and security experts. Park Hae-mook\/The Korea Herald.The Saenuri Party\u2019s leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun egged on the debate by saying Sunday that the government should consider all measures against Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear threat. \u201cIt is time to put even unthinkable options on the table,\u201d he said, hinting at the possibility for nuclear armament. A group of Saenuri lawmakers who formed a parliamentary group calling for nuclear armament demanded Monday that the government develop a nuclear submarine on its own and redeploy US tactical nuclear weapons. In September 1991, former US president George H. W. Bush withdrew tactical nuclear weapons from Korea under his campaign to reduce nuclear arsenal known as the \u201cPresidential Nuclear Initiative.\u201d Three months later, the two Koreas signed the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Led by former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul as well as more than a dozen of his fellow party members, the group said in a statement that the National Assembly should build a bipartisan legislative body to come up with specific measures for nuclear armament. But dissenting voices emerged even among the hawkish wing of Saenuri lawmakers. They described nuclear armament as \u201cfar-fetched\u201d because any damage to the NPT and other non-nuclear agreements would seriously strain ties with Washington as well as the international community.\u201c(Nuclear armament) is an unrealistic choice. It would only lead to South Korea\u2019s diplomatic and economic isolation,\u201d said Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun in a media interview. Yoon was a member of the Assembly\u2019s Foreign Affairs, Trade and Unification Committee and had served as presidential secretary for civil affairs for President Park Geun-hye.Citing US President Obama\u2019s pledge to maintain a non-nuclear policy on the Korean Peninsula and the extended deterrence to South Korea, Yoon said that Washington would never agree to Seoul\u2019s nuclear armament or the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons. The opposition parties also denounced the calls, accusing the pro-nuclear lawmakers of engaging in a political stunt to promote their profile. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that the nuclear armament is a politicized campaign to cover up the government\u2019s failure in containing cross-border tension,\u201d said Rep. Yoon Kwan-suk, a spokesman of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Yoon asserted that if the government seeks to develop or deploy a nuclear weapon, it would lose moral grounds to criticize Pyongyang for obtaining nukes in violation of the 1991 denuclearization pact.The People\u2019s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won also condemned the nuclear armament initiative. \u201cNuclear armament is a dangerous and irresponsible policy and could bring another war on the Korean Peninsula. They should stop promoting a populistic approach to security matters,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, some opposition lawmakers joined calls to rethink Korea\u2019s current defense strategy.Rep. Kim Chong-in, the former chairman of the Minjoo Party, said in a Facebook post, \u201cIt is hoped that the president and leaders of the three parties have a detailed and substantial discussion on reviewing the redeployment of tactical nuclear (weapons) of the USFK, tasks that need to be accomplished during next month\u2019s Korea-US Military Committee Meeting and the Security Consultative Meeting, and measures against North Korea\u2019s additional nuclear test within this year, to dissolve the anxiety felt by the people.\u201d (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","121":"The Seoul bureau of environmental group Greenpeace said Monday it has filed a suit against the South Korean nuclear security watchdog to nullify a plan to build two more nuclear reactors in the country's southeastern city of Ulsan.In June, the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission allowed the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. to construct Shin Kori No. 5 and No. 6 in the industrial city.The international group said it filed the case with the Seoul Administrative Court on Monday along with 559 citizens who joined the suit as plaintiffs.\"The commission gave a nod to the plan without properly considering the risk the new plants could pose in the region,\" said lawyer Kim Yeong-hee, who represents the plaintiffs. \"It also failed to fulfill procedural requirements such as discussing with nearby residents in advance.\" The latest approval came nearly five years after the nuclear watchdog delivered their last construction permit, a long hiatus attributable to safety concerns over nuclear reactors following Japan's nuclear disaster in Fukushima in 2011. The addition will bring the total number of South Korea's nuclear reactors to 30, including four currently under construction.As a member of the Nonproliferation Treaty, South Korea keeps nuclear reactors only for energy use, not for weapons purposes.The KHNP has said it plans to finish the construction of the new reactors by 2021 and 2022, respectively.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","122":"Some photos taken 20 years ago on Chuseok, traditional thanksgiving holiday in South Korea, were released from The Korea Herald\u2019s archive on Monday.

Kim Hyun-kwon, adding the government should come up with stricter quarantine measures. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, at least 3,400 public officials and 19,000 civilians were put into work to cull and bury infected poultry at 42 sites across the nation, over the past 40 days since the virus was first detected in South Chungcheong Province. Researchers collect bird flu-infected poultry at a farm located in Incheon on Monday. (Yonhap)There have been no reports of infections through people or livestock thus far.While local governments are mainly responsible for dispatching people to work at infected poultry farms, military officials said Tuesday they have been sending the Army\u2019s Chemical Forces to affected areas in South Gyeongsang Province and North Jeolla Province since last week, due to a shortage of workers. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that the government classified some 13,000 workers at the disease-hit sites as a high-risk group to receive state monitoring, and helped them get vaccinations.Quarantine authorities added that they also provided workers antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and protective clothing to guard against the outbreak spreading to people.But the highly pathogenic bird flu is spreading at an unprecedented pace across the country, having already swept through neighboring countries earlier this year, killing over 20 people. In China, there have been 16 H5N6 human infections since 2014, resulting in the deaths of 10 of those infected.So far, authorities said 26 people among the high-risk group reported flu-like symptoms, but none of them have been confirmed to have the virus.The highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of bird flu is currently being examined at the National Institute of Environmental Research to find out if the outbreak can spread to people, authorities added.The current outbreak is already worse than that in 2014, when 13.96 million fowls were put down over six months. A record number of 10 million chickens, ducks and quails have been culled throughout the nation so far, with an additional 3.78 million in waiting.By Kim Da-sol(ddd@heraldcorp.com)","124":"In Ireland, cows graze on unsoiled grass and feed on preserved hay in winter.

The 15-member council convened an emergency session in New York on Friday, hours after the communist state carried out its fifth underground blast, which demonstrated the strongest explosive power yet. The body issued a press statement condemning the act, vowing to tighten its squeeze through a new resolution.\u00a0 An ultra-right group performs a mock burning ceremony of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in condemnation against Pyongyang\u2019s Sept. 9 nuclear test in Gwanghwamun, downtown Seoul, Saturday. (Yonhap)South Korea has begun coordination on international measures with the US, Japan and other countries, and is stepping up diplomatic efforts to bring on board Russia and China, the North\u2019s diplomatic backers and permanent members of the UNSC. The allies are likely to call for the envisioned resolution to include an additional export ban on items and an expanded blacklist of North Korean personnel and entities suspected to have been involved in its nuclear and missile programs.\u00a0 The Foreign Ministry here is known to have handed over a list of potential steps through its UN representative in New York. Seoul is also seeking to impose further standalone sanctions as it did following Pyongyang\u2019s last atomic and long-range missile experiments earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to assume what the upcoming resolution would be about, but we think that it should first and foremost take into account the factors that we could not consider in making Resolution 2270,\u201d a senior ministry official told reporters on Sunday, referring to the document passed in March after the North\u2019s fourth nuclear test. \u201cIt should also be able to plug any perceived loopholes stemming from the last resolution, as well as embrace new factors we\u2019ve found out throughout its implementation over the last six months.\u201d Regarding individual sanctions, the government will explore various options on its own and also through consultations with Washington, Tokyo and other partners so as to boost synergy, the official said. On the military front, the US plans to dispatch a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to South Korea next month in a show of force to deter further military provocations, a ministry official here said. The USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), the flagship of the Yokosuka, Japan-based Carrier Strike Group Five of the US Navy, will sail to South Korea\u2019s Yellow and South seas to participate in a joint naval exercise with South Korea, slated for Oct. 10-15, the official said. The exercise will focus on training the allies\u2019 naval forces on joint precision attacks on North Korea\u2019s key military facilities and the regime\u2019s leadership, attacks that would be launched in the event of a war with the communist country. Called a floating air base, the vessel is capable of carrying some 80 combat fighters and aircraft, as well as about 5,400 crewmen. Powered by two nuclear reactors, the USS Ronald Reagan is part of powerful deterrence assets the US maintains against North Korea\u2019s military threats.Other warships under the Carrier Strike Group Five will accompany the USS Ronald Reagan to the drills, the official said, including the USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG-54), USS John S. McCain (DDG-56), USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62), USS Stethem (DDG-63) and USS Barry (DDG-52) destroyers. Sources said the US will dispatch a strategic bomber, possibly the B-2, to South Korea as early as Monday from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.\u201cThe deployment of a strategic bomber on the Korean Peninsula alone mounts a considerable level of pressure on North Korea,\u201d a military official said. The North carried out the latest nuclear explosion on its founding anniversary Friday, just eight months after its fourth test in January. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff assessed the nuclear test at the Punggye-ri nuclear site as the North\u2019s biggest test to date, with the device giving off an explosive yield reaching 10 kilotons. The yield was higher than the estimated 6 kilotons detected in January\u2019s nuclear test.The UNSC on Friday strongly condemned North Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test and pledged to begin work immediately to put together a new resolution of sanctions punishing the communist nation.\u201cThe members of the Security Council strongly condemned this test, which is a clear violation and a flagrant disregard of Security Council resolution,\u201d Security Council President and New Zealand Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen told reporters after urgent discussions, reading a press statement.\u201cIn line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin work immediately on appropriate measures under Article 41 in a Security Council resolution.\u201dIt could take weeks to put together new sanctions. It took about two months for the council to adopt a new resolution following the North\u2019s fourth nuclear test in January.On Sunday, a top US envoy said Washington and Tokyo are also seeking \u201cthe strongest possible\u201d measures against North Korea.Sung Kim, the US State Department\u2019s special representative for North Korea policy, suggested that the US may launch its own sanctions in response to \u201cthe provocative and unacceptable behavior by the North Koreans\u201d after his meeting with Japanese counterpart Kenji Kanasugi.Kanasugi said Seoul, Tokyo and Washington would continue to work together.\u201cWe agreed to continue Japan-US and Japan-US-South Korea cooperation ... as we work toward an adoption of a new UN Security Council sanction that will include further sanction measures against North Korea,\u201d he said in a statement.Kim added that Washington\u2019s \u201cdialogue\u201d with Beijing over the crisis will continue.\u201cWe continue to work together to urge China to implement existing Security Council resolutions ... and to work with us to make sure North Korea\u2019s behavior and their deliberation change in a more productive and positive direction,\u201d Kim said.After the North\u2019s fourth nuclear test in January, the Security Council adopted the fifth and toughest-ever sanctions on the North, including mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North and banning exports of coal and other mineral resources. Cooperation from China is key as the country is one of the veto-holding permanent members of the Security Council, along with Britain, France, Russia and the US. China is North Korea\u2019s top trading partner and responsible for the isolated nation\u2019s energy needs. But Beijing has long feared that pressuring Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse and bring about instability on its border with China and the ultimate emergence of a pro-US nation, according to analysts.After the UN meeting, China\u2019s Ambassador Liu Jieyi avoided directly answering questions about Beijing\u2019s sanctions commitment.\u201cWe are opposed to testing and we believe that it is more urgent than ever to work together to ensure denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAll sides should refrain from mutual provocation and any action that might exacerbate the situation.\u201dSeoul and Beijing also discussed measures, according to the Foreign Ministry here on Saturday through the top nuclear envoys.Kim Hong-kyun, Seoul\u2019s special representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs at the ministry, spoke with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei on the phone. \u201cBoth agreed to keep open the lines of communication and cooperate with each other in regards to the North\u2019s nuclear issue, including future countermeasures,\u201d the ministry said in a press release.During the talks, Wu noted that China will never recognize North Korea as a nuclear state, nor will it condone the country holding nuclear weapons. He also said that Beijing stands firm on denuclearization, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.Since March when the toughest-yet sanctions resolution was adopted, North Korea has carried out 21 ballistic missile launches.On Saturday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said he will urge cooperation in formulating a new set of sanctions against the communist state as he attends the week-long UN General Assembly meeting starting Saturday.During his stay in New York, the country\u2019s top diplomat will hold a meeting with his counterparts from the US and Japan to discuss how to impose stronger sanctions against Pyongyang, the ministry said. Yun is also to deliver a speech at the UN General Assembly meeting on Sept. 23.Meanwhile, North Korea said Sunday that the US\u2019 push for sanctions was \u201claughable\u201d and the country would continue to strengthen its nuclear power.\u201cThe group of (US President Barack) Obama\u2019s running around and talking about meaningless sanctions until today is highly laughable,\u201d the state-run KCNA news agency cited a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying in a statement.Earlier on Saturday, the North\u2019s ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam vowed the reclusive country will increase its presence in international society to meet its \u201cstatus as a nuclear power,\u201d according to the North\u2018s state-run Korean Central News Agency.Kim, the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, said \u201c(North Korea) will secure the world peace and safety and continue to expand and develop international relations in a way that fits its status as a nuclear powerhouse.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee and news reports","126":"President Park Geun-hye on Friday excoriated North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the country\u2019s fifth nuclear test, calling him \"uncontrollable\" and stressing the need to strengthen the U.S. extended deterrence.During a meeting of top security and foreign policy officials, Park underscored that the communist state's evolving nuclear threats are \"urgent and existential\" for South Korea, and that the international community's response to them must be \"diametrically different\" from what it has been.\"This (Pyongyang's nuclear test) clearly reaffirmed the North Korean regime's recklessness and its obsession with nuclear arms,\" she said during the meeting upon returning from an eight-day overseas trip.\"Kim Jong-un does not listen to anything from the international community so he can hold onto power, and this leads us to view his mental state as uncontrollable,\" she said.President Park Geun-hye speaks during a meeting with top security and foreign policy officials at her office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Sept. 9. (Yonhap)Park, in particular, underscored the need to strengthen the U.S.' extended deterrence, which involves the nuclear umbrella.Extended deterrence means Washington's stated commitment to mobilize all military capabilities, nuclear and conventional, to defend its ally against Pyongyang's possible aggression and provocations.\"To allay our people's concerns, I instruct our military to maintain a full readiness posture to strongly retaliate against any type of North Korean provocation,\" Park said.Park, in addition, called for an end to the political offensive against the planned deployment of a US anti-missile system to the Korean Peninsula, saying that the nation should take \"basic\" steps to defend itself against the possibility of a North Korean attack.Seoul and Washington plan to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to the peninsula by the end of the next year.

The previous resolutions were adopted after the North's first nuclear test in 2006, its second nuclear test in 2009, its long-range rocket launch in late 2012 and its third nuclear test in early 2013.Cooperation from China is key to the UN Security Council's push to adopt a new sanctions resolution as the country is one of the veto-holding permanent members of the Security Council, along with Britain, France, Russia and the U.S. China is North Korea's top trading partner and supplies almost all of the isolated nation's energy needs, but analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border with China and the ultimate emergence of a pro-US nation. (Yonhap)","130":"North Korea is believed to have carried out Friday another nuclear test assessed to be its largest one to date, South Korean military said. This marked the fifth official nuclear experiment by the communist state since the UN Security Council adopted a resolution banning it from any nuclear or ballistic missile programs.The Joint Chiefs of Staff said that a magnitude-5.0 artificial earthquake had been detected near Punggye-ri, Hamgyeong Province, where an underground nuclear test site is located. The waves had been reported by the state-run Korea Meteorological Administration.Soldiers and citizens stand at Seoul Station on Friday, watching news on the artificial earthquake believed to be caused by North Korea\u2019s largest-ever nuclear test. Yonhap\u201c(The military) believes that it is a nuclear test, and we are conducting further analysis on the nuclear material used and whether the test has succeeded,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said in a press briefing.Based on the size of the seismic event, the KMA estimated the yield of the test to be about 10-12 kilotons, which amounts to 67-80 percent of that of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in 1945.Pyongyang\u2019s fourth and latest nuclear test in January, which caused a magnitude-4.8 earthquake, was assessed to involve 6 kilotons.No further signs of unusual movement were detected from the North Korean military afterwards, according to military.North Korea, which remained silent in the hours following the explosion, later confirmed the observations.\u201cOur nuclear scientists and technicians have carried out a nuclear explosion to check the capacity of a new nuclear warhead,\u201d the North\u2019s official channel Korean Central TV said at around 1:30 p.m.\u201cIt has been confirmed that the test neither caused radiation leaks, nor exerted any negative influence on the surrounding natural environment.\u201dPyongyang\u2018s state nuclear institute also claimed to have succeeded in miniaturizing the nuclear warheads, a phase deemed critical to mounting the warhead onto a ballistic missile.In light of the circumstances, Cheong Wa Dae said President Park Geun-hye will return earlier than expected from Vientiane, Laos, where she rounded off an eight-day overseas trip encompassing a series of multilateral and bilateral summits.\u201c(The test) is proof of the frantic recklessness of the nuclear-obsessed Kim Jong-un administration,\u201d the president said in an emergency meeting in Laos. Attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Trade Minister Joo Hyung-hwan and chief senior presidential secretaries.\u201cThe North\u2019s nuclear test will only result in strengthened sanctions and isolation from the international society and its provocations will lead to self-destruction,\u201d the president added, vowing all measures to curb the communist neighbor\u2019s nuclear ambitions.The South Korean president also talked over the phone with her US counterpart Barack Obama. The two had met Tuesday in Hangzhou, China, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit, and reached a consensus on enforcing sanctions against North Korea.\u201cPresident Obama said that the US will take all measures based on the mutual defense treaty, including the nuclear umbrella, to protect South Korea from the North\u2019s provocative threats,\u201d the Blue House said in reference to the presidents\u2019 phone conversation.President Park Geun-hye (right), along with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (far left) and senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs Kim Khou-hyun, attend an emergency meeting in Vietiane, Laos, to discuss response measures to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test. YonhapAccording to an official from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Minister Yun Byung-se held phone conversations with his US and Japanese counterparts John Kerry and Fumio Kishida and agreed on additional sanctions on the North.This will likely involve closing the current loopholes in the sanctions based on the UNSC resolution 2270, as well as the independent sanctions by each countries.While the state leader set to returning back home, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn presided over a National Security Council meeting and Defense Minister Han Min-koo attended a parliamentary defense committee meeting in the afternoon.\u201cThe government sternly urges that North Korea immediately scrap its nuclear and missile programs in a complete, testable and irreversible way,\u201d NSC Secretary-General Cho Tae-yong said through an official statement speaking for the government.Friday also marked the 68th anniversary of the North\u2019s government foundation day, around which observers and officials here had been anticipating an armed protest near Pyongyang to commemorate the occasion.The Defense Ministry spokesperson, however, said it is too early to definitively determine the North\u2019s intention behind the test and the type of explosive device used.Under orders from its leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea has been seeking to advance its nuclear and missile programs. It has seen advances particularly in ballistic missile technologies, conducting its first successful launches of the intermediate-range Musudan and submarine-launched KN-11 missiles this year.While the hermit kingdom declared it had used a hydrogen bomb in the January test, it was widely assessed by experts such as IHS Jane\u2019s to be a boosted fission weapon. The test, along with the long-range ballistic rocket launch in February, prompted the UNSC to pass resolution 2270 which encompasses the most powerful economic sanctions against Pyongyang to date.Earlier in the day, the European Mediterranean Seismological Center announced that a magnitude 5.3 earthquake was detected at the China-North Korea border region at around 9:30 a.m., at a depth of zero kilometers.At the parliamentary committee for national defense, Defense Minister Han said that South Korea and the US are cooperating to keep a close eye on North Korea\u2019s movement, while stepping up vigilance against possible additional provocations.The National Intelligence Service Director Lee Byung-ho, however, explained that the North\u2018s miniaturization of its nuclear warheads is progressing at a faster rate than previously anticipated.

Ahn Hoon\/The Korea HeraldThe focal point of emphasis for many participants, especially the delegation from South Korea, is the ongoing North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs.In a video message, President Park Geun-hye said the North\u2019s provocations represent a blatant threat against the international society\u2019s efforts toward peace.\u201cIn order to address the North Korean nuclear issue that is threatening world peace, cooperation and unity of the international society is of the utmost importance,\u201d Park said.Hwang echoed the president\u2019s remarks and called for tight cooperation among nations and regions against worldwide security issues, vowing that Seoul will actively participate in efforts to resolve North Korean nuclear programs, eradicate terrorism and deal with natural disasters and climate change.Minister Han said that the world currently faces challenges ranging from the \u201ctraditional liabilities\u201d of the North, to disputes among countries in the North East Asia region over territory and history-related issues, terrorism, along with cultural and religious conflicts leading to violence. \u201cDespite efforts by the international society to achieve peace, humanity still faces numerous challenges. ... The most pressing task in order to accomplish global peace and stability is (resolving) North Korea\u2019s nuclear issue,\u201d said Minister Han in his opening remarks. \u201cI hope that the SDD 2016 will provide insights for dealing with North Korean nuclear and missile programs, cyber threats and for achieving global peace,\u201d Han said.The OPCW Director-General Uzumcu stressed the importance of his organization\u2019s chemical weapon convention that has seen 93 percent of declared chemical weapons destroyed to date. He mentioned the ongoing mission against Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, adding that reports of a fact-finding mission has found likelihood of chlorine being used as a weapon and that the UNSC is expected to discuss follow-up measures.\u201cThere nonetheless remains both new and unfinished business to attend to -- respectively, the specter of chemical terrorism and the contingency of having to eliminate other chemical weapons programs, which North Korea is widely suspected of operating,\u201d he said. The first plenary session was about the denuclearization of North Korea and international cooperation. North Korea is currently under UN Security Council resolutions that impose economic sanctions and bans it from carrying out any nuclear or ballistic missile programs.David Shear, the US principal deputy under secretary of defense for policy, said that North Korean nuclear programs represent threats not only to South Korea, but also to Japan and the US, along with other countries in the region.He reiterated that the US will not recognize Pyongyang as a nuclear state, saying that the US will use deterrence, pressure and diplomacy so Pyongyang \u201cwill not achieve prosperity while it flouts obligations.\u201d\u201cThe US will continue to further strengthen our defense of the ROK (South Korea),\u201d he said.With North Korean missile programs emerging as an imminent threat, local experts said that the gathering of defense officials from around the world can help boost security in the region.\u201c(The SDD) brings together high-ranking officials and experts from not only countries around the peninsula and Asia-Pacific, but also Europe and Americas to discuss specific plans of cooperation in defense and solutions to current crisis,\u201d said Kim Chang-su, a senior fellow for the local think tank Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. \u201cThis will serve as a reminder of the grave nature of security issues and the potential of feasible solutions (discussed at the forum).\u201dBy Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","132":"Prosecutors said Thursday they will question Lotte Group founder Shin Kyuk-ho at his office later in the day over a string of corruption allegations raised against the conglomerate.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said because of Shin's health issues, its officials will carry out the questioning of the 93-year-old business tycoon at his office in Hotel Lotte in Seoul, starting at 3:30 p.m.Prosecutors met with Shin the day before to examine his overall health.

Schools will be given the right to choose from among the new textbook and other private textbooks issued under the current system.\"We will secure autonomy, diversity and improve the overall quality of the textbooks by letting schools choose between the approved private textbooks and the state-authored textbooks starting in 2018,\" Education Minister Lee Joon-sik said at a press briefing held at the government complex in Sejong, 121 kilometers south of Seoul.During a month-long opinion gathering period that ended on Friday, the ministry received a total of 3,807 opinions, with 1,630 related to the content and 67 to typos.The ministry plans to produce the final version of the textbooks in January. The Park Geun-hye administration has pushed for the state-issued textbooks to fix what it called predominantly \"left-leaning\" content in existing private publications and to forge a \"common understanding\" of history.

(Yonhap)","135":"This is the third installment of a three-part series on Seoul\u2019s battle against three types of urban pollution: smell, noise, and light. -- Ed.Office worker Wi, 26, often plays soccer at a public field near Gangnam, but he recently faced resistance from some residents who live nearby. An official from the district office asked Wi and his teammates to avoid playing soccer there at night, as there had been complaints that the bright lights at the field disturbed residents. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make sense that we play soccer with the lights turned off. The field is open for all citizens to use,\u201d Wi said.Eventually, the district office, the residents and the soccer team reached a temporary compromise to use the stadium lights only up to 10 p.m.Strong light is emitted from the lights at a public soccer field in Seoul. (Kim Da-sol\/The Korea Herald)This incident was one of 1,216 cases reported to the Seoul Metropolitan Government regarding light pollution last year. There are no concrete regulations restricting the use of bright lights at night, making it difficult for parties involved to reach a solution on light pollution.According to the SMG, complaints related to light pollution issue have been increasing each year. In 2012, 857 cases were reported and there were 1,571 cases in 2014. Most of them were made by residents who complained their sleep was being disturbed and they were being inconvenienced by bright lights.\u00a0 Light pollution refers to when an inappropriate use of light disturbs one\u2019s health or living status, or damages the environment, according to the Ministry of Environment.Most light pollution in the city come from neon-light advertisements on the streets, light-emitting diode light bulbs installed around buildings including restaurants and cafes, and headlight beams from vehicles, among others. South Korea, along with Italy, have been listed as countries with the most extensive light pollution among the G20 countries in a report released by the Italian Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in June.An interactive map from the Italian Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute reveals the full extent of light pollution around the globe. (Daily Mail)South Korea ranked second, reaching the 89.4 percent level in light pollution index, just 0.9 percentage point behind Italy.Researchers added that more than 80 percent of the world population suffers from light pollution, while 1 in 3 people around the globe cannot observe the Milky Way from the sky in their home countries. The report explained that light pollution creates a luminous fog or \u201csky glow,\u201d which impairs the view of stars and constellations in the night sky.Light pollution can also be detrimental to health. In human bodies, light works as a biological trigger that suppresses health-improving functions that should naturally occur in our bodies at night.Studies have showed that being exposed to light at night can lead to health damages linked to obesity, depression, sleeping disorders and cancers. Scientists have also found an undisputed connection between sufficient sleep and good health.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has underlined the importance of exposure to daylight during the day and darkness at night to maintain a routine circadian rhythm. The WHO lists \u201cshiftwork that involves circadian disruption\u201d as a probable carcinogen.To come up with countermeasures regarding light pollution in the city, the government enacted a light pollution protection law in 2013, but the effectiveness of its enforcement is still under question.According to the law, each district office is responsible for restrictions on light pollution by designating a so-called environment protection zone for light control. However, conflicting opinions between district offices and owners of restaurants and cafes frequently lead to disputes.To effectively control the light pollution issue, the Seoul City set up a special committee last year to check and require newly constructed buildings to receive an approval regarding light options.When neon-sign advertisements which emit strong lights at night are installed in residential areas, their brightness should be under the level of 25 lux, -- the unit for luminance and luminous emittance -- equivalent to the brightness emitted by 25 candles, explained an official from the SMG\u2019s life environment division.If a light-emitting facility does not follow the regulation, it will receive up to 3 million won ($2,745) in penalty. If it ignores the district order to follow the regulation, it can be fined to up to 10 million won.\u201cWe are in the course of promoting clearer and specific standards and requirements to cope with the light pollution issue,\u201d the official said.The SMG also added that it has started to install street lights with automatic light sensors that allow them to be turned on when human motion is detected. This follows the first and successful installation of the \u201cSmart LED road light control system\u201d last year at some dozen streets in Dongdaemun-gu.

In this image carried Tuesday by North Korea\u2019s official Rodong Sinmun, leader Kim Jong-un (far right) smiles during the country\u2019s test of ballistic missiles one day earlier.The latest launch was designed to \u201creassess the flight safety and guidance of the ballistic rockets, which have been deployed after performance improvement, while judging and evaluating the actual fight competency of the artillery units,\u201d the official Korean Central News Agency said, adding the results were \u201cperfect.\u201d\u201cWe need to continue to expand miraculous achievements in strengthening the nuclear force which have been taking place in this historic year opening with a hydrogen bomb,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying during the event, referring to the country\u2019s Jan. 6 underground blast. \u201cThrough the ballistic rocket firing exercise, the military might of the artillery units, which have strengthened and developed into a powerful class capable of staging a pre-emptive strike at any time and any place, was presented to the whole world,\u201d the dispatch added. Given their flight trajectory, the tested weapons are presumed to be the Rodong intermediate-range missiles with an upgrade in the warhead part, Yonhap News reported, citing an unnamed government source who analyzed images published earlier in the day by The Rodong Sinmun, a Workers\u2019 Party mouthpiece. The missiles in the photos were seemingly different from those unveiled following the Rodong\u2019s July 21 test. They appear to be akin to the Scud missile in the cone-shaped warhead section but had a slightly hollow surface in the propellant and other parts. \u201cWe knew that North Korea has been improving the Rodong,\u201d the source was quoted as saying. \u201cThe North made it public today through the paper and indeed presented the upgraded edition.\u201d But Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry remained cautious, saying that together with the US, it has determined the missiles were simply the Rodong. Asked about the possibility of the projectiles being Scuds, spokesperson Moon Sang-gyun dismissed it, citing \u201cvarious circumstances and data including debris and flight trajectory.\u201d\u201cWhat we announced yesterday was based on our judgment and it\u2019s accurate \u2026 and the results are shared by the US,\u201d he said at a news briefing Tuesday, without elaborating due to intelligence matters. The US Strategic Command issued a statement saying two of the three missiles were presumably intermediate-range ballistic missiles but it is still assessing the other one, without specifying their names.Following the firing, Seoul, Washington and Tokyo requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council in New York later in the day to discuss its response to yet another breach by Pyongyang of multiple resolutions. The three countries are also seeking to deliver a solid message against the communist state\u2019s ceaseless provocations during the ongoing ASEAN and forthcoming East Asia summits in Laos. Beijing, for its part, has expressed its displeasure over the launch, which came shortly after a summit between President Park Geun-hye and her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference in Hangzhou.

Marking the 25th anniversary of the event, Astana held a two-day forum titled \u201cBuilding a Nuclear Weapon-Free World\u201d last week. It brought together over 40 high-ranking government officials, diplomats, mayors, experts, scholars and nongovernment representatives from around the world. South Korean Minister of Unification Hong Yong-pyo attended the event, and spoke of North Korea\u2019s nuclear development program, urging the communist regime to follow Kazakhstan\u2019s course.\u00a0South Korean Minister of Unification Hong Yong-pyo speaks at a forum titled \u201cBuilding a Nuclear Weapon-Free World\u201d in Astana, Kazakhstan last Monday, organized to mark the 25th anniversary of the decommissioning of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. (Ministry of Unification)\u201cThe decision of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to close down the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk was a historic step for peace and human dignity against the threat of nuclear weapons,\u201d Hong said in a speech. \u201cKazakhstan voluntarily removed its nuclear weapons and it was a right choice. As a result, the country is now enjoying the trust of foreign partners and attracting large investments. It has grown into an economic powerhouse in Central Asia.\u201d The erstwhile Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989. The full impact of radiation exposure was kept secret for many years by the Soviet authorities, and was only brought to light after the test site was decommissioned. Commemorating the milestone event, the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 2, 2009 unanimously adopted resolution 64\/35, which launched the International Day against Nuclear Tests to be observed annually on Aug. 29. Highlighting Pyongyang\u2019s proliferating nuclear program -- the only country to have conducted four atomic tests in the 21st century with the threat of more to come -- Hong expressed concerns over the impact on environment and people living in areas near the test site in North Korea, called Punggyeri. Referring to a survey of defectors from the region, he said the area\u2019s residents suffered from cancer, heart diseases, sensory disorders and paralyzed legs.\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear development must be stopped,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThe Pyongyang regime must realize that it is threatening the life of Korean people and ruining the land where our children have the right to enjoy a bright future.\u201d Seoul aspires for a unified Korean Peninsula that will contribute to a nuclear-free and peaceful world, the minister added.\u00a0Kazakh Ambassador to Korea Dulat Bakishev (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)In an interview with The Korea Herald last week, Kazakh Ambassador to Korea Dulat Bakishev underlined that nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation are Astana\u2019s main foreign policy priorities. \u201cKazakhstan consistently stands for nuclear disarmament and strict adherence to the principles of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, alongside the inalienable right of states to their peaceful use of nuclear energy,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe express deep concern that while the nonnuclear weapons states have generally fulfilled their commitments under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, also known as the Nonproliferation Treaty, nuclear weapons states have not taken decisive actions to get rid of their atomic arsenals.\u201d Adding that the indefinite extension of the NPT should not serve as basis for delaying the reduction of nuclear arsenals, the ambassador said his government has urged other states to make a further cut of their atomic weapons toward full elimination. At the first Nuclear Security Summit in Washington D.C. in April 2010 and the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September last year, Nazarbayev proposed concrete measures for nuclear disarmament. The president\u2019s proposal included the total elimination of nuclear weapons as the only absolute guarantee of peace; the adoption of a worldwide multilateral and legally binding document to guide the abolishment of atomic arsenals; the redirection of investment into the sustainable development of communities, economies and the environment; and worldwide compliance with international humanitarian laws and norms. \u201cIn the 21st century, humanity must take decisive steps toward demilitarization,\u201d Nazarbayev said in Washington in March. \u201cWe won\u2019t get another chance.

Taipei will also provide financial support to Taiwanese firms aiming to penetrate markets in the above regions, with an emphasis on the services industries.In terms of human exchange, the policy will adopt a \u201cpeople-centered\u201d approach, encouraging collaboration among young scholars and students and industry experts.\u201cFor resource sharing, Taiwan will seek bilateral and multilateral partnerships using the country\u2019s capacities in agriculture, culture, medicine, technology and tourism,\u201d the mission said. \u201cButtressing regional connectivity entails institutionalizing various channels of bilateral and multilateral partnerships.\u201dThe grand scheme, announced on the inauguration of Tsai on May 20, differs from previous approaches, according to policy experts, reinforcing a multilayered and multifaceted cooperation.\u00a0Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen (Yonhap Photo)Previous presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian had attempted similar measures, but to little avail, they noted, adding expectations would be different this time around.Lai I-chung, deputy chief executive of the Democratic Progressive Party-affiliated Taiwan Thinktank, reported, \u201cChina\u2019s economy is slowing down and many Taiwanese businesses are actively looking to other markets for growth. After years of reconstruction, ASEAN is gradually regaining its economic prosperity.\u201dThe policy is riding on the wave of surging Taiwanese investments in ASEAN, which has attracted increasing foreign investments following the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community last year. Experts have argued that the policy is also expected to run into headwinds, as Taiwan is embroiled in a territorial dispute with the Philippines and Vietnam over the Taiping Island in the South China Sea, and capitals around the world have cut or curtailed ties with Taipei, succumbing to Beijing\u2019s pressure. Taipei has itself trimmed and streamlined diplomatic missions worldwide recently to align them with the New Southbound Policy. Diplomatically recognized under Beijing\u2019s purview by many nations, Taipei has faced hostile cross-strait currents since Tsai assumed office. Her Democratic Progressive Party has historically sought independence from the mainland, which sees Taiwan as one of its provinces under the enshrined foreign relations doctrine, the \u201cOne China\u201d policy.Diplomatic relations between Taipei and Seoul were terminated on Aug. 23, 1992, after Seoul officially established ties with Beijing.

The hearing opened at Kim Jae-jung Presidential Library and Museum in Mapo-gu, with most of the key government-related witnesses absent.The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has said the committee does not have legal grounds to hold any type of hearing, as its tenure was completed as of June 30 based on the special act on the Sewol disaster.Most of the key witnesses called in by the committee were absent, including officials of the maritime police and the Navy that had been in charge of the rescue operation.A total of 304 people, many of whom were high school students on a field trip, perished in South Korea\u2019s worst maritime disaster in April 2014. Although some officials have been convicted, questions remain over the systematic fallout that led to the tragedy. They include the alleged negligence of the government in managing overloaded vessels and failed rescue operations.Members of the Sewol Special Committee hold its third hearing at the Kim Jae-jung Presidential Library and Museum in Mapo-gu, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)The committee has been seeking to investigate officials of the ship\u2019s then operator Chonghaejin Marine Co., other high-ranking officials of the Korean Coast Guard and ship-inspecting organization Korean Register of Shipping, among others.It has also requested the appearance of ruling Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who is accused of attempting to censor a news report on the tragedy while he was serving as the senior presidential secretary at the time of the accident. He did not attend.On the first day of the hearing, witnesses, including survivors and employees of the ferry, gave their testimonies, suggesting rescue missions had been insufficient.Ryu Hee-in, a member of the committee, raised questions over some discrepancies found between the survivors\u2019 testimonies and records of a digital video recorder that keeps track of the CCTV footage that had been handled by the authorities.The committee also raised allegations that Chonghaejin Marine Co. may have attempted to maximize its target sales by adding on the amount of transported construction materials.The Sewol committee found that the 6,835-ton ferry carried 2,215 tons of cargo, more than double its cargo limit of 987 tons at the time of its sinking.The hearing was held amid an ongoing hunger strike by family members of the victims that began last month in protest against the government\u2019s decision to dissolve the committee.The government disbanded the Sewol Special Committee, citing the Sewol Special Act that took effect on Jan. 1, 2015. The act allowed the committee to conduct a probe for 18 months with another three months to report on their findings. The committee comprised members recommended by the rival parties, the bereaved families, the Supreme Court and the Korean Bar Association.Families of the victims and civic groups claim the committee was prematurely disbanded as its official launch date should be considered to be when the organization was allocated budget and manpower. They argue the committee has eight months more to operate.Despite the government refusing to cooperate, the committee has said it will bring in government officials from Cheong Wa Dae, the prosecution and the Maritime Ministry to question alleged peddling of influence in local media and the government\u2019s lukewarm efforts to save lives.

John Seong, who is in charge of policy coordination with Seoul and Tokyo for the US Agency for International Development as a counselor at the US Embassy in Japan, underscored the need to craft fresh ways to mobilize finances and build capacity in the developing world to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. SDGs are a new global development agenda for the next 15 years. With Korea and the US each carrying out similar aid programs, the two countries could create synergy by working together with a focus on such areas as girls\u2019 empowerment, science and technology innovation, leveraging the private sector, and health, he said.\u00a0 John Seong, counselor for international development at the U.S. Embassy in Japan (KOICA)\u201cI think we can\u2019t just do business as usual all the time as we have done in the past many years. ... The aim is very high -- it\u2019s about zero hunger, zero malnutrition, and zero under-5 deaths. It\u2019s like absolute terms that the SDGs are pursuing,\u201d he said in an interview with The Korea Herald. \u201cEspecially Korea, from what I\u2019ve gathered, is very eager to apply new things, experiment different things, just like the use of science and technology innovation. That\u2019s probably one of more effective ways to accomplish the SDGs, and that is also the right track of it.\u201d Seong, who served in countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Nairobi and East Timor for the aid agency over the past 25 years before taking up the latest duty, was attending the Seoul ODA International Conference hosted in Seoul by the Foreign Ministry and Korea International Cooperation Agency.During the event, Seong introduced the US\u2019 assistance programs, review of the previous Millennium Development Goals and plans to implement the SDGs. He also confer potential partnerships with KOICA officials, based on which he will likely visit Seoul in October for a formal consultation. Another promising field could be girls\u2019 welfare, empowerment and education, he noted, as Seoul and Washington have introduced related initiatives, known respectively as \u201cBetter Life for Girls\u201d and \u201cLet Girls Learn.\u201d \u201cWhen I look at the objectives of both programs, there are quite a few overlapping areas. We would like to see opportunities to work together in some of the countries of mutual interest,\u201d Seong said. Given the growing significance of non-government financing, the two countries can also explore how to leverage the private sector for development objectives, while cashing in on their expertise in health care services, he added. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got to find the way that commercial interests match ODA objectives, we can do that through discussions and studies,\u201d Seong said. \u201cThere are more because the health area is also big at KOICA, and the US has been a leader in global health, so there should be ample opportunities.

He said the city will continue to draw up detailed plans to create an urban park upholding the historical value of the site.After several rounds of talks stretching decades, South Korea and the US agreed in 2004 to relocate the US military headquarters in Yongsan to an expanded military base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. In 2010, both agreed to complete the relocation by 2017.Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon speaks during the press conference at the City Hall on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The US Army Garrison in Yongsan was first set up in 1945, allowing US troops to hold de facto control of the Yongsan region for its strategic location in the capital after South Korea became independent.Giving an example of Stanley Park -- the park that borders the downtown of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada -- Mayor Park said that building Yongsan Park can decide Seoul\u2019s future and reputation as a city landmark.\u201cStanley Park is one of the most beloved parks that was created by the Vancouver City Council to celebrate the first year of independence from the UK,\u201d said Park during the press conference at City Hall.\u201cAs you can see, the park became Vancouver\u2019s pride and a historical symbol, appreciated by citizens who can enjoy the green oasis in the city as well as to remember the historical meaning,\u201d he added. In 2006 the SMG announced it would turn the Yongsan base area into a park larger than London\u2019s Hyde Park when US troops move out. However, its initial plan to fully use the 3.58 million square meters of the land fell through, as central government ministries competed for use of the land.According to city government, state organizations, such as the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, have beaten the city to reserve the use of 930,000 square meters of land. Another 220,000 square meters of land will be handed to US troops for the relocation of the US embassy in 2019. Additional distribution of the remaining land lots can be made to the US upon their request.Currently, 68 percent of the site can be turned into a park.In 1992, some 290,000 square meters of land, including a golf course, was returned to the city government for the use of the site for the National Museum of Korea and Yongsan Family Park.Park claimed that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport unilaterally pushed its position to use the land without considering the purpose or value of the park.In May, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced its plan to build a national science museum following the relocation of US troops.Park contended that there are a number of historical and cultural resources in the Yongsan area, including a prison that was used during the Japanese colonization era.\u201cBased on our blueprint for the park, we will first set up a data bank and research archive to study the historical value of Yongsan, and ultimately apply for UNESCO listing,\u201d Park said.The Seoul Metropolitan Government also added it would actively support citizens to engage in creating the park by operating citizen-run design labs and seminars.By Kim Da-sol(ddd@heraldcorp.com)","153":"North Korea is building a mobile long-range missile launcher system that can move along the country's railroad tracks, the U.S.-based Radio Free Asia reported Wednesday, citing sources in the communist country.A North Korean resident in Kangwon Province told RFA that North Korean engineers have been working on the mobile missile system since May at a state-run motor vehicle factory.

The list could put pressure on those countries to end such practices at a time when labor export has become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang.The 23 countries are Angola, Burma, Cambodia, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Laos, Poland, Malaysia, Malta, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Senegal, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.They are also reportedly forced to work usually between 12 and16 hours, and sometimes up to 20 hours, per day, with only one or two rest days per month. Health and safety measures are often inadequate, and workers are given insufficient food.The report is the latest in a series of measures by Washington to increase pressure on Pyongyang over its human rights record. In July, the US imposed its first-ever sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for his role in the country's human rights violations.\"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is one of the world's most repressive countries,\" the State Department said in the latest report. \"The government seeks to dominate all aspects of its citizens' lives, and it restricts the exercise of fundamental freedoms, including freedoms of expression, religion, peaceful assembly, association and movement.\"The department outlined its strategy for addressing the situation in the North, largely in three categories: efforts to promote international awareness of the abuses in the North, including helping defectors to share their experiences; providing outside information to North Korean people; and promoting accountability among North Korean officials.\"Those responsible for serious human rights violations in the DPRK must be held accountable,\" the department said. \"While full accountability is a long-term goal, we continue to seek opportunities to promote accountability and to remind DPRK officials that they will be held responsible for their actions.\"July's US blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim and his aides was part of such efforts, it said. The department vowed to \"continue to collect and evaluate information with the goal of identifying more individuals, at all levels, associated with human rights abuses.\"In a section about countries that forcibly repatriate North Korean refugees, the report only said that there were reports this year that North Korean refugees were arrested in Vietnam and handed over to Chinese authorities, and that non-governmental organizations continue to report that repatriations took place along the China-North Korea border.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.

Friedt, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance, said during a visit to Kazakhstan, according to a transcript provided by the department.\"That is why we reject the final report from the Open Ended Working Group on nuclear disarmament, which recently completed its work. The United States calls on all states to reject unrealistic efforts to ban nuclear weapons,\" she said. \"The OEWG final report and efforts to institute a legal ban on nuclear weapons fail to take account of the international security environment and will neither lead to the elimination of nuclear weapons nor uphold the principle of undiminished security for all,\" she added.Instead, the US is engaging members of the UN Security Council on a resolution that would emphasize the importance of maintaining a moratorium on nuclear explosive tests while at the same time trying to persuade Congress to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Friedt said.\"Today only one state, North Korea, continues nuclear testing, despite overwhelming international pressure and condemnation,\" she said.Friedt also outlined a series of efforts the US has made under President Barack Obama's vision for a nuclear-free world, such as reducing its deployed stockpiles and launchers through the New START Treaty, diminishing the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy and securing the nuclear deal with Iran.Obama is also reportedly considering renouncing the preemptive nuclear strike option to bolster his legacy as champion of a world without nuclear weapons. The so-called \"no first use\" policy has unnerved allies depending on US nuclear weapons for their security.A series of security experts have expressed strong concern about abandoning the nuclear preemptive strike option, saying it would send the wrong signal at a time when Russia is flexing its military muscle, China is building up its nuclear forces and North Korea is bent on developing nuclear missiles.The no first use policy could erode the confidence allies have in the US nuclear umbrella, they said. (Yonhap)","162":"At least two THAAD batteries are necessary for South Korea to better defend against North Korea's submarine launched ballistic missiles as a single unit can't cover all of the North's seas, a US arms expert said Monday.Increasing THAAD batteries, however, doesn't guarantee full defense against the North's SLBMs because it's questionable whether THAAD is capable of intercepting missiles that are launched at high angles and involve atmospheric reentry, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.\"THAAD has a forward-looking radar with a 120-degree field of view. In the case of a single THAAD battery, North Korea's submarines would not have to travel very far out to sea to attack the THAAD system from behind the field of view of its radar,\" Lewis said, referring to the North's SLBM.\"South Korea needs two THAAD batteries to better cover ocean approaches. That is an obvious solution to at least part of the problem posed by the KN-11,\" the expert said in an article posted at Arms Control Wonk, a blog website he founded.The assessment came after the North successfully conducted the latest SLBM test last week, sending the missile, designated KN-11, some 500 kilometers over the East Sea, the greatest distance the communist nation has achieved since it began SLBM tests last year.Moreover, the missile was launched at a high angle, meaning the missile could have flown farther.\"North Korea fired it nearly straight up, reducing the range.If fired on a minimum trajectory, the KN-11 would have traveled much further than 500 km over 1,000 km and probably much further,\" Lewis said.Deploying two THAAD units, however, \"does little to address the possibility of lofted attacks,\" he said.\"Lofting a long-range missile results in reentry at very high speeds and at a very severe angle. Whether THAAD can deal with a lofted KN-11 depends in part on the missile's range,\" he said.\"There was a healthy debate in 1990s about THAAD's ability to intercept warheads reentering at higher speeds.\"THAAD is designed to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles with ranges of 1,000-3,000 kilometers and in theory should have some capability to intercept intermediate-range missiles with ranges of 3,000-5,500 km. But the system has never been tested against an intermediate-range target, let alone on such an unusual angle of attack, Lewis said.The Pentagon's testing office -- the office of Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E;) -- gives THAAD a good rating against medium-range ballistic missiles, but the lowest possible rating against Intermediate-range ballistic missiles, he said.The expert stressed, however, that beefing up defenses could lead only to accelerating arms races.\"South Korea has every right to defend itself against ballistic missile attack, both through THAAD and indigenous missile defenses.I don't understand the public opposition to THAAD in South Korea,\" he said. \"But even so, I don't think we can arms-race our way out of vulnerability with North Korea.\"He said the North has too many countermeasures to defeat missile defenses.\"Deploying defenses and precision-strike capabilities will intensify the arms race rather than provide an escape from it,\" he said, adding that arms-racing is like a Gordian knot, \"where our best efforts to wriggle free of vulnerability only tighten the ropes.\"\"Our best option, unpalatable as it may be, involves finding ways to discourage North Korea from developing new capabilities.Defense is a far less effective strategy,\" he said.

The South Korean military said the missile flew about 500 kilometers toward Japan, making the longest flight by such a missile launched by the communist country.\"South Korea's military should move to deal effectively with North Korea's SLBM threat by deploying submarines with nuclear propulsion that can better detect and attack North Korean vessels,\" the lawmakers said in a statement.\"Pyongyang must stop military provocations that threaten not only Northeast Asia, but the entire world,\" they added. \"North Korea should take the path of peace and prosperity and realize that nuke tests and missile launches will only lead to self-destruction.\"\u00a0(Yonhap)The group is led by five-term Rep. Won Yoo-chul, along with 22 other lawmakers. \"South Korea, surrounded by sea at three sides, is vulnerable to North Korea's SLBM threats. Deployment of a nuclear-powered submarines is needed to counter such provocations,\" Won said.A nuclear-powered submarine can stay submerged and hidden as long as it has fuel and supplies for the crew, making it harder to track compared to conventional diesel-electric subs that usually have to surface and operate a diesel engine to recharge its batteries. Such vessels can be assigned to patrol around North Korean submarine bases, without being detected, and trail SLBM-armed subs heading out to sea.\"South Korea's military should consider getting nuclear submarines that can deal with North Korea's SLBMs,\" Chung Jin-suk, Saenuri's party whip, also said. \"(SLBMs) are a more serious threat compared to other land-based missiles as it is difficult to detect the launch point.\"Chung also urged opposition parties to join parliament's efforts to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear missiles, pointing at the pacifist stance of Choo Mi-ae, newly-elected head of the Minjoo Part of Korea.\"It is disappointing and regretful,\" Chung said, concerning Choo's plan to protest against the deployment of an advanced US missile defense system in the country. \"We need to make a rational decision based on the national interest when it comes to security issues.\" The South Korean government and Saenuri have been pushing for the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system against North Korean provocations, although liberals in the country have been protesting, fearing such a step will further escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula.

The congress was never held while the incumbent leader's late father Kim Jong-il ruled the country.\"Youth league organizations and youth should become the vanguard and shock brigade in building a socialist power,\" Kim said during his speech at the congress, reported by the Korean Central News Agency.The youth league was created by the country's late founder Kim Il-sung in 1946, the largest youth association governed by the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.North Koreans aged from 14 to 30 are required to join the association which is known to command a membership of some 5 million young people.The congress came as more North Koreans including members of the elite have been defecting to South Korea amid the leader's reign of terror. Seoul's unification ministry said Friday that the holding of the youth congress reflects North Korea's move to strengthen its campaign for mobilization.Members of the youth league were mobilized last year to build a new hydroelectric power plant near Mount Paekdu, the highest peak on the divided peninsula.

Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency also said the missile was fired at a high angle.\"The success of North Korea's latest submarine-launched ballistic missile test suggests the program may be progressing faster than originally expected. However, this does not mean it will be ready next week, next month or even next year,\" John Schilling, a top expert on North Korean rockets, said in comments carried by the website 38 North.\"Rather, the pace and method of the North's SLBM testing would suggest possible deployment in an initial operational capability by the second half of 2018 at the earliest,\" he said.Schilling pointed out Russia's SLBM development process, saying the North appears to be following the model. In Russia's case, even after two years and 12 tests of varying degrees of \"success\" after its first successful launch from a submarine, there were still glitches to be found and fixed, he said.\"The North Koreans may skip some of these tests but rushing development almost certainly sacrifices reliability, and fielding inadequately tested or unreliable missiles could result in sunken submarines -- a high price to pay when the North has only a single ballistic missile submarine of limited capability,\" Schilling said.The expert also noted that the North has only one GORAE-class submarine that could theoretically be used to field an SLBM, and cannot count on a single prototype submarine with one to two missiles to carry out wartime missions. \"Such a deployment would be more of a bluff than a game-changing threat,\" he said.Moreover, the North's submarine has only been put to sea for short periods in coastal waters to verify basic seaworthiness and conduct a few launches, Schilling said. If it is meant to be an operational boat, it will need realistic testing in operational environments, such as exercises with its surface fleet, he said.\"While 38 North has reported on the North's building up of infrastructure to construct new submarines -?upgrading, modernizing and erecting new construction halls at the Sinpo South Shipyard ?- so far no information is known about whether actual submarine construction has begun,\" Schilling said. \"A new submarine could probably be built within a two-to-three-year time frame, but the likelihood of building new models without further testing and refinement of the experimental GORAE-class seems low,\" he said.

The official, whose identity and current whereabouts remain unclear, is known to have had served at Pyongyang\u2019s trade representative within its consulate-general in Vladivostok before leaving there with his family. Affiliated with the North\u2019s Ministry of External Economic Affairs, the secretary-level diplomat was responsible for sending needed supplies back home, aside from the main trade affairs. Seoul\u2019s foreign and unification ministries on Friday acknowledged the reports but declined to confirm, citing defector safety concerns and diplomatic sensitivity. \u201cBut it is true that North Korean officials from various sectors have recently been defecting, some of them chose to come here (and not elsewhere),\u201d a Foreign Ministry official said.\u00a0 North Korean Embassy in London. (Yonhap)The reports came about just a week after Seoul announced the arrival in Seoul by Thae Yong-ho, the North\u2019s No.2 official at its embassy in London. He was among the highest-ranked who had escaped their oppressive homeland and resettled in the South in recent years, alongside senior military officers and other working-level diplomats. From Russia, Kim Chol-song, a third secretary and trade representative of the North Korean mission in St. Petersburg, landed in Seoul in July 2015. The apparent newest defection coincides with rampant speculation that the Kim Jong-un regime had dispatched a group of some 100 state security and trade department officials to carry out an all-out inspection on all trade representatives in border regions in China, via Vladivostok. The delegation reportedly pushed for an extensive personnel shake-up there before returning home earlier this week, resulting in a freeze of some trade missions in three border provinces in China -- Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang.Shortly after Thae\u2019s defection, the communist state shelved its plan to send five businesses to an investment and trade fair in Yanji, Jilin Province, which is scheduled to kick off Sunday. While a steady influx of defectors has for years been business as usual, the apparent rise of departures among the relatively privileged class seemingly demonstrates deepening economic difficulties in the reclusive society amid international sanctions over its nuclear program.The cash-strapped regime, in turn, is believed to have been heaping pressure on diplomats and other workers overseas to maneuver new ways to secure hard currency, sometimes involving illicit measures, or face punishment. \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing various aspects of reality in North Korea from the recent series of defections, which may be inevitable in the face of changes in the Kim Jong-un era,\u201d Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a news briefing Friday. \u201cThe serial defections appears to be a phenomenon influenced by growing instability within North Korea due to Kim\u2019s reign of fear which is aimed at consolidating his power base.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","172":"North Korea on Friday opened the congress of a youth association for the first time in 23 years as the country's leader Kim Jong-un is seeking to solicit support from young people to cement his power.The Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League held the ninth congress in Pyongyang, the North's state media said, without elaborating.It marked the country's first congress by the youth league since February 1993.

The Sinpos are relatively small subs with a displacement of around 2,000 tons. They are known to have vertical ballistic missile launch tubes built into the sail of the submarine.On Wednesday, North Korea launched an SLBM from the East Sea, the country's third SLBM test-fire this year.The missile flew some 500 kilometers before landing in waters within Japan's air defense identification zone, demonstrating an improvement from its previous launch tests. Bermudez said the latest missile appears to have been fired underwater from a submarine, rather than from a submersible test barge, which he said may have been the case for the North's SLBM test last December. North Korea is displaying a strong will to build an operational SLBM system under a long-term plan and steady progress has been made, he said.If North Korea achieved that goal, it would complicate ballistic missile defense planning and operations being sought by South Korea and the US, he also warned. Assuming the current rate of development, North Korea is on track to develop the capability to strike targets in the region, including Japan, from a missile fired from a submarine by 2020, he noted. Citing 38 North's satellite imagery taken on Monday near a submarine base near the eastern port city of Sinpo, the analyst said North Korea seems to have made preparations for the Wednesday SLBM launch that day.

Since it first started its official development assistance in 1987, Korea has been striving to shore up its commitment by focusing on sharing technology and other know-how from its own rapid development. Nearly 30 years on, officials, scholars and activists are fiercely discussing how to redefine Korea\u2019s ODA model. The topic is expected to come to the fore ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election and beyond, as is the issue of whether and how to integrate loans and grants. Adding to the debate are external factors such as a resurgence of nationalism that culminated in Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. \u201cIt will be imperative to watch how the Trump administration, Brexit, and the global nationalist movement alike shape up the discourse and policy on ODA at home and abroad,\u201d Kim In, vice president of the Korea International Cooperation Agency, told The Korea Herald. \u201cInternally, debate will continue to heat up over how to establish a \u2018Korean-style ODA.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u00a0 A volunteer from the Korea International Cooperation Agency teaches students at an automobile vocational training center set up by the Seoul-based grant provider in Magway, Myanmar.

Yet only six member states met the UN target of 0.7 percent of gross national income, with Korea not among them. Another six lowering ODA expenditure. In the wake of Brexit, there are concerns that more European nations might cut the financing of programs that have saved millions of lives across the globe. Trump\u2019s vision for overseas aid remains largely unknown. But his team has singled out nuclear proliferation and the fight against terrorist groups like the Islamic State group as its top foreign policy priorities, which may mean a loss of interest in Washington\u2019s aid disbursements. If the isolationist trend accelerates in the coming years -- with donor states turning more inward and injecting more resources into propping up their domestic economy -- it could affect Seoul\u2019s ODA spending, undercutting calls for a further increase, experts said. Mindful of the concerns, Oh Joon, Seoul\u2019s former ambassador to the UN, stressed the significance of the Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted at the UN in late 2015 as the next development agenda for 2020. By achieving the SDGs, the international community could also curb the dark side of globalization such as inequality and the cultural, social and racial divide, he said. \u201cHow to maximize the benefits of globalization and minimize its side effects is now the task of the times,\u201d he said at a seminar on development aid in Seoul early this month. \u201cThe SDGs may serve as a compass that will guide globalization in a positive direction, putting the furthest behind first and leaving no one behind. Korea, too, should work to put the SDGs in the mainstream of its development cooperation diplomacy.\u201d\u00a0Korea plans to spend about 2.7 trillion won ($2.3 billion) on nearly 1,300 ODA programs next year, representing a 12 percent on-year growth. Bilateral grants and loans account for around half and 34 percent of total expenditure, respectively, with the remainder allotted to fund multilateral partnerships. Most of the projects are designed to help recipient countries tackle industrialization, poverty, education and health in line with the SDGs.\u00a0 A Kenyan mother poses with her baby after being treated at a hospital built by the Korea International Cooperation Agency in Kitengela, Kenya.

Though the share of loans in the entire budget has steadily risen, consensus among the 28 countries of the Development Assistance Committee has long built toward a 100 percent grant principle. Korea\u2019s GNI ratio stands at a mere 0.14 percent -- far lower than not only the UN target, but also the 0.3 percent rich-world average. Conflicting interests and tension between the foreign and finance ministries -- in charge of grants and loans -- have been blamed for eroding the aid\u2019s overall effectiveness. With the Prime Minister\u2019s Office having failed to play a coordinator role, the UN, OECD and other international and local relief groups have expressed concerns about the fragmentation. The ongoing discussion on \u201cKorean-style ODA\u201d was essentially born out of the concerns, as Seoul\u2019s current scheme was modeled on that of Japan, which also faced similar setbacks. As part of the efforts, talk is resurfacing of incorporating grants and loans in the next administration, industry insiders say. Views vary, however, as to whether the government should launch a new, independent aid agency such as the US Agency for International Development, or if a ministry should take over other agencies\u2019 functions to become a control tower. But Lee Tae-joo, a cultural anthropology professor at Hansung University in Seoul, emphasized that instead of modeling, the central point of debate should remain how to boost aid\u2019s sustainability such as by promoting public-private partnerships and the ownership of the recipient countries. \u201cSince Korea joined the DAC in 2010, political demands have been soaring for the establishment of a \u2018Korean-style\u2019 assistance,\u201d he said during the seminar. \u201cBut even Japan has not modeled its methods because, according to Japanese specialists, each developing country needs a different model based on its characteristics and contexts.\u201d \u201cTo promote genuine cooperation with developing countries, we need to gather knowledge about their history and geology and foster serious conversations, whether it be grants or loans,\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","177":"President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday requested again that the National Assembly adopt its report on the confirmation of a police chief nominee, her aides said, a legal step to accelerate the process of officially appointing him.On Aug. 2, Park requested that the legislature conduct a confirmation hearing on Lee Cheol-seong, currently deputy commissioner general of the National Police Agency, and adopt a report on the nomination.But the adoption of a confirmation report has been delayed as opposition parties called on the president to withdraw the nomination, citing a series of Lee's ethical lapses, including his past record of drunk driving.By law, the legislature is to finish its deliberation on a top-office nominee within 20 days of the president's request for a confirmation process. Beyond the time limit, the president can make another request.But if the legislature refuses again to adopt a confirmation report, the president can appoint the nominee without parliamentary consent.Lee is expected to be appointed as early as Wednesday.Lee, if appointed, will succeed Kang Sin-myeong whose two-year term ended Tuesday.

It is the first time that a local citizen has been infected with the disease without having traveled overseas.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that a 58-year-old man was infected with cholera in the southern city of Gwangju, after he started suffering from diarrhea on Aug. 10.Eight days after he was hospitalized at a regional medical center, he was reported to Gwangju\u2019s public health center as a suspected case of cholera.\u00a0Jung Ki-Suck, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leaves after a news briefing at its headquarters in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)On Monday, he was confirmed to have been infected with cholera. He has since been sent home upon recovery, after being quarantined and treated. While his wife, son and daughter do not show any symptoms, health authorities said that it will conduct an additional investigation to check if they have also been infected.Health authorities said that it is conducting an epidemiologic investigation into how the man caught cholera without travelling abroad since June last year. Experts suggested the infection could have been caused by food, which was possibly carrying the cholera bacteria -- Vibrio cholera -- when it was imported overseas. The infected man reportedly told health authorities that he ate seafood during his trip to the southern coast earlier this month.Since 2003, all reported cholera cases here were found to have been contracted from abroad.South Korea saw the highest number of cholera cases in 2001, when there were 162 infected individuals concentrated in Gyeongsang Province. The record was followed by 145 infected people in 1980, 113 in 1991 and 68 in 1995.Experts said it is not likely that the recent cholera case will develop into an epidemic.\u201cSince the main route of infection is through contaminated food or water, it is very rare (for it) to become an epidemic in developed countries with decent environment and social infrastructure,\u201d said professor Choi Jun-yong of the infectious diseases division at Severance Hospital.During the 19th century Korea, some 400,000 people -- about 50 percent of the entire population at the time -- were killed by the disease, when it had a less developed groundwater pipe system compared to now.Cholera infection can come from drinking contaminated food or groundwater, such as cholera-contaminated fish, shellfish or water. In rare cases, direct contact with an infected person\u2019s excrement or vomit can also lead to infection. Cholera normally has an incubation period of 2-3 days. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, muscle cramps and dehydration, while severe cases can lead to deaths. Health authorities encouraged citizens to take preventive measures such as consuming safe drinking water, avoiding raw food and washing their hands often for at least 30 seconds each time.To monitor the outbreak of infectious diseases, the CDC has activated an emergency quarantine control system from May.

An Hee-jung, who also served in the former liberal Roh Moo-hyun government along with Moon, claimed the idea of an immediate constitutional revision is \u201cirrational.\u201dSome minority party candidates, however, have claimed that a revision of the basic law is needed to fundamentally reform the nation\u2019s political system. Among them are former Democratic Party Chairman Sohn Hak-kyu and Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, a fourth-termer in the conservative stronghold city of Daegu.The central point of dispute is the adoption of a runoff election in the upcoming presidential race.The idea of putting two finalists to a second round, in case neither attains a majority vote in the first round, has recently been suggested as a way to assure the public\u2019s approval of the winner.It was mostly runner-up candidates who called for such reinforced competition, in an apparent move against Moon\u2019s lead among opposition hopefuls.\u201cOnly by adopting a runoff election may we properly reflect the people\u2019s will in the election result,\u201d Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung wrote via his Twitter account.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party, one of the strongest advocates of the runoff system, even accused Moon of dismissing the competitive system out of fear of losing his upper hand in the race.Although Moon admits the need for a runoff election, he said a constitutional revision is first needed to introduce a system that is not currently in place under current law.He also expressed disapproval of the idea of reducing the term of the incoming president from five years to three years, so as to let the following presidential election take place in 2020 along with the general election.\u201cThe reduction of the (presidential) term should be based on a constitutional revision into a Cabinet government system,\u201d he said last week, effectively dismissing the issue for the time being.But Mayor Lee and Rep. Kim, along with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, all argued that given the current political situation, the next president\u2019s term should be shortened.All three runner-up figures are considered to have relatively low chances of winning against Moon in next year\u2019s race.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","180":"North Korea is estimated to have produced enough weapon-grade plutonium for about two to four more nuclear weapons than previously assessed, the US-based Institute for Science and International Society said Monday.The institute based the speculation on the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s recent evaluation of the communist country\u2019s nuclear capacity.In the Aug.19 report, the IAEA said Pyongyang appears to have unloaded fuel from its 5-megawatt electric reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility in late 2015 and processed it to separate plutonium in the radiochemical laboratory in the first quarter of 2016.A satellite image of North Korea\u2019s Yongbyon site (Yonhap)\u201cIn this case, we have estimated that North Korea could have produced and separated an additional 5.5-8 kilograms of weapon-grade plutonium,\u201d David Albright of the ISIS said in a report. \u201cThis amount of plutonium is enough for two to four nuclear weapons, assuming 2 to 4 kilograms of weapon-grade plutonium per weapon, or a central estimate of three additional nuclear weapons based on plutonium.\u201dThe IAEA reported that its monitoring of the Yongbyon site -- which include satellite imagery -- indicated comprehensive activities at nuclear-related facilities. It said indications of the reactor\u2019s operation had ceased to appear between mid-October and early December last year, during which the reactor may have been defueled and refueled. But the organization added that such observations cannot be confirmed, as it does not have access to Yongbyon or the uranium concentration plant and uranium mine in Pyongsan.ISIS estimates that the communist North currently has about 13 to 21 nuclear weapons as of this summer, including the weapon-grade uranium as well. The tally excludes the addition of weapon-grade uranium production during the past 18 months that may have occurred at a second enrichment plant outside Yongbyon. \u201cIf this second plant was included, the upper bound of 21 would increase by a few nuclear weapons,\u201d Albright noted.The think tank in June said North Korea appears to have procured an additional four to six nuclear weapons in the past 18 months.South Korean experts have presumed that the North has approximately 40 kilograms of weapon-grade plutonium. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his nuclear ambition during the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea\u2019s Congress in May, followed by the country\u2019s first successful intermediate Musudan ballistic missile launch in June.On Monday, the hermit kingdom blasted the annual South Korea-US joint military drill Ulchi Freedom Guardian as \u201ca phased scheme for invasion,\u201d and threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the allies.It has claimed that the joint drills, such as the UFG and the annual Key Resolve exercise held earlier in the year, drives up tensions in the Korean Peninsula.But a new study by the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies denied correlation between the joint exercises and the North Korean provocations. Beyond Parallel, a CSIS-affiliated website, analyzed the North Korean provocations from 2005 to 2016 and found that the said exercises have had \u201cnull effect.\u201dData showed instead that the state of Washington-Pyongyang diplomatic relations prior to the exercise better indicated whether there would be provocative actions by the North -- with worse bilateral relations leading to a higher chance of belligerence during and after the drills. \u201cThe Beyond Parallel dataset really undercuts the argument that the US and ROK are the \u2018bad guys\u2019 on the peninsula riling tensions with twice-yearly military exercises. ... It\u2019s just untrue,\u201d Victor Cha, CSIS senior advisor and Korean chair, was quoted as saying.The heighten tension is attributed to the leadership change in Pyongyang, the report found, as both the intensity and frequency of the country\u2019s belligerence stepped up after former leader Kim Jong-ill -- Kim Jong-un\u2019s father -- was confirmed to have suffered a stroke. Before he suffered the stroke, there was an average of 2.5 provocative acts per year from North Korea, but this has now jumped to 8.9 per year. This includes ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests, according to the report.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","181":"The parliamentary committee in charge is preparing to conduct a hearing at local detention centers this week in order to put uncooperative key witnesses on record.At the center of attention is Choi Soon-sil, the president\u2019s longtime friend who allegedly used her high-profile connection to exert influence on state affairs and reap personal benefits. The special parliamentary probe committee Sunday made preparations to hold an on-site hearing at the Seoul Detention Center starting from 10 a.m. Monday, according to officials.The center, located in Uiwwang, Gyeonggi Province, is where key suspect Choi has been kept in custody since late October. Woo Byung-woo, a former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, attends a parliamentary hearing Thursday to answer questions on his alleged involvement with Choi Soon-sil. Choi was absent, citing health reasons. (Yonhap)Choi, who earlier attended the court\u2019s pretrial and underwent the independent counsel\u2019s questioning, has absented herself from the five parliamentary hearings held so far, citing poor health and mental distress.Unlike the special prosecutor team and court, however, the parliamentary committee does not have the ability to summon witnesses against their will.Two former presidential officials, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, have also been called to take the stand, but like Choi, their attendance still remains uncertain.The parliamentary committee\u2019s plan is to have An and Jeong brought from their detention center in western Seoul to the Seoul Detention Center for the day, to exert pressure on Choi. But they are also considering visiting the two centers separately, if the two former Blue House figures resist the summons. However, concerns persist that the parliamentary hearing will draw out little from the reticent culprits and that the task of finding the truth will eventually go to the special prosecutors.Another challenge for the legislature, apart from the stalemate in its probe, is the mounting pressure that it should move on from the corruption scandal and pay more attention to economic issues.Rival parties have recently been gesturing at holding a provisional session early next year, as the ruling Saenuri Party\u2019s factional feud has halted all parliamentary discussions this month.The Saenuri also agreed that a supplementary budget may be necessary to add momentum to the nation\u2019s stalled economy.Meanwhile, reformists of the divided Saenuri camp are expected to exit their party Tuesday to create a new conservative political entity.Their key task is to gather at least 35 lawmakers -- according to an early proclamation -- and hopefully raise the number to 38 or more, in which case they would outnumber the People\u2019s Party to become the third-largest party in the National Assembly.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heradcorp.com)","182":"National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun on Tuesday said South Korean parties must overcome differences on the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system in the country, adding the issue should not weigh on the unity of the political segment.\"Now is the moment to come up with a conclusion that overcomes ideologies and political tensions to minimize public division,\" Chung said. South Korean parties have been divided over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense in the southern part of the country, which the government claims is vital to improve its defense capabilities against North Korea's nuclear provocations.While the conservative-ruling Saenuri Party has been supportive of the move, some opposition parties claim the deployment will hurt Seoul's ties with Beijing and Moscow, and thus must be scrapped.

The KCNA generally focuses on broadcasting Pyongyang's messages abroad and is not accessible to ordinary North Koreans.Observers said that even after Seoul acknowledged the defection of Thae and his entire family last week following media reports, Chosun Central TV and the Rodong Sinmun, the country's main paper and organ of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, did not cover the incident at all.\"Internal news outlets covered 'regular stories,' which seems to be an intentional move by authorities to withhold the defection from the general population,\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University.He speculated that Pyongyang clearly does not want the people to know that the No. 2 diplomat to its embassy in London had defected to South Korea.\"By attacking Thae and Seoul through the KCNA it is expressing its views without running the risk of ordinary people knowing about the desertion,\" he said.The North has claimed Saturday that Thae is a criminal and attacked Seoul for using him to spread lies about the North. It also attacked London for not handing the criminal over to North Korea despite strong protests being lodged.Related to the defection that probably took place last month, a British newspaper over the weekend said that Thae contacted British intelligence two months ago and that he made his escape with the help of the United States.The Sunday Express said Thae and his family got on a British military jet and were flown to Germany before heading to South Korea.

The exchange of fire was the result of heightened tensions sparked by the land mine attack carried out by the North that gravely injured two South Korean soldiers.

Kim will be officially named to the post after the Assembly\u2019s plenary session endorses the committee\u2019s report, to be followed by the president\u2019s formal appointment.A native of Imsil, North Jeolla Province, Kim graduated from Seoul National University\u2019s School of Law before passing the bar exam. He served as a civil court judge in Seoul from 1992 to 1995. Since 1995, he has moved to his alma mater, and researched and lectured on the civil code.He is to be the second professor-turned-justice at the Supreme Court since former Justice Yang Chang-soo, who served between 2008 and 2014 before returning to the academia.\u00a0(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","191":"President Park Geun-hye's summit diplomacy next month is likely to focus on highlighting the necessity of deploying an advanced US missile defense system in South Korea and tightening international cooperation against Pyongyang's unrelenting military threats, analysts here said Friday.On Sept. 2, Park will embark on a weeklong trip to Russia, China and Laos for a series of multilateral and bilateral summits on regional and global issues, which would serve as a crucial opportunity for her to ensure that the international community remains united against North Korea's nuclear adventurism, local observers said.Above all, the most pressing task for the president is to ease tensions with Beijing and Moscow, which have strenuously opposed the plan by Seoul and Washington to station a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on the peninsula by end-2017. \"Her trip to Russia and China was arranged in the midst of various forms of pressure on South Korea to scrap the THAAD deployment plan,\" Nam Chang-hee, international politics professor at Inha University, said.\"Park should stay focused steadfastly on seeking understanding for Seoul's position that the deployment was an inevitable choice in response to Pyongyang's growing missile and nuclear threats.\" On Sept. 2, Park will fly to Vladivostok, Russia, for the Eastern Economic Summit and a bilateral meeting with her Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin. Following her trip to Russia, she will travel to Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 4 for the Group of 20 (G20) summit. Laos will be the last leg of her three-nation trip. From Sept. 7-9, Park will attend the forums related to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a bilateral summit with her Laotian counterpart Bounnhang Vorachith. Photo taken on April 1, shows President Park Geun-hye (left) shaking hands with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before their talks on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. (Yonhap)During the multilateral summits, Park is expected to encounter the leaders of the United States, China and Japan, among others.But her aides said whether Park will hold bilateral summits with any of them is yet to be determined.The South Korean chief executive is expected to capitalize on these gatherings to stress that the planned deployment of THAAD will not target any country other than North Korea.Amid strong opposition from China and Russia, Park has defended the deployment plan as a \"self-defense\" measure, vowing not to bow to any pressure when it comes to the crucial issue of national security.Beijing and Moscow believe that a THAAD battery on the Korean Peninsula would strengthen America's military clout in the Asia-Pacific region and thus undermine their security interests.China's opposition to THAAD, in particular, has caused a diplomatic headache for Park as she has been striving to strengthen the strategic partnership with the Asian power -- despite growing concerns both in Seoul and Washington that South Korea, America's core ally in the region, was tilting too much towards China.Since Park took office in February 2013, the South Korean leader has been trying to shore up trust with China, South Korea's key partner for trade, tourism, as part of a plan to push the North to denuclearize and lay the foundation for reunification of the divided country. The former Lee Myung-bak government gave short shrift to China with its policy thought to have focused inordinately on the US It sought to strengthen the South Korea-US alliance, which had buckled under his predecessor Roh Moo-hyun, who pursued a more \"balanced\" relationship with the country's superpower ally.During her possible encounter with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Park may seek to patch things up with him, the observers said.Ensuring that the international community maintains a united front against the North's nuclear program would be another critical task for Park's multilateral diplomacy drive next month.The vehement opposition from Beijing and Moscow -- the key players in the implementation of international sanctions on North Korea -- has spawned concerns that they could become less willing to faithfully enforce the sanctions due to the THAAD row.In March, the U.N. Security Council imposed the toughest-ever set of sanctions on the communist state for its nuclear test in January and long-range rocket test the following month.\"Park may be able to garner China's understanding over the THAAD issue by emphasizing to Xi that Seoul would not have decided to deploy THAAD had Beijing taken a meaningful step to prevent Pyongyang from advancing its nuclear and missile programs,\" Inha University's Nam said.At the multilateral summits in China and Laos, maritime disputes over the South China Sea could also be dealt with at the gatherings, which could put Park in a diplomatically challenging situation.Seoul has maintained that freedom of navigation and flight over the South China Sea should be protected, and that the strategically vital waterway should not be militarized. But it has been cautious not to step into the increasingly sensitive spats over territorial issues centered on the South China Sea.In Laos, Park is expected to seek ways to further strengthen economic ties with the ASEAN, whose regional influence has been increasing since it launched the ASEAN Economic Community late last year, experts pointed out.In recent years, Seoul has intensified efforts to build deeper, wider economic ties with the resource-rich ASEAN that boasts a huge market with the combined population of 632 million. ASEAN is South Korea's second-largest trade partner with two-way trade reaching $119 billion last year.\"The ASEAN is rich in natural resources and labor force -- a reason why South Korean companies have been seeking to advance into it,\" Jang Jun-young, Southeast Asia expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.Jang added that Seoul needs to expand its diplomatic cooperation with the ASEAN over various issues including North Korea-related ones -- rather than focusing its policy toward the bloc wholly on the economic dimension. (Yonhap)","192":"North Korea on Friday slammed South Korean military's largest-ever live-fire exercise conducted to mark last year's inter-Korean artillery clash, denouncing it as a rash provocation. South Korea's military on Thursday carried out the drill along the tense inter-Korean border, involving 49 front-line artillery battalions. It was the military's biggest-ever artillery exercise in size, with about 300 guns being fired in a show of force.It took place two days before South Korea marks the anniversary of a brief artillery engagement with North Korea on Aug. 20. The exercise aimed to demonstrate Seoul's determination to firmly counter Pyongyang's military provocations. \"In the past, (South Korea) has been crazy about military provocations driven by a war fever to invade North Korea, but the latest shelling exercise which involved so many artillery units lurking along the front-line is unprecedented,\" the North's ruling-party published Rodong Sinmun newspaper said.The large-scale fire exercise is bringing the Korean Peninsula into the \"worst state of crisis\" ahead of South Korea's annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian drill set to start on Aug. 22, the North Korea mouthpiece newspaper said. The rash military act is enraging the North Korean military and people, the newspaper claimed, warning that \"any rash military provocation will result in (South Korea) paying a high-price penalty.\"\u00a0 (Yonhap)","193":"A North Korean official managing money for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Europe has disappeared, raising speculation that he might have defected with a large amount of state funds, a local media report said Friday.Citing anonymous sources, Dong-A Ilbo, a major daily newspaper here, reported that the official in charge of money management for the so-called No. 39 office of the Workers' Party vanished in June.The office is known for running money for Kim's regime.The North Korean official is currently staying in an unidentified European country. He and his two sons are also under the protection of local authorities, the report claimed. The media report, which has not been independently verified, said that he disappeared with billions of dollars that had been under his management. He was reported to have worked in the same European country for the past 20 years.If confirmed, this would mark yet another high-profile defection of a North Korean following the Seoul government's announcement on Wednesday that Thae Yong-ho, minister at the North's mission in London, defected to the South with his wife and children.The seasoned diplomat's defection is seen as a sign that the international community's stepped-up sanctions on the North following its nuclear and missile provocations is taking a toll even on the country's elite.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","194":"A Britain-based senior North Korean diplomat directly flew to South Korea after expressing his wish to defect to the Seoul government, a source said Friday.Thae Yong-ho, who served as a minister at North Korea's embassy in London, and his family arrived in South Korea late last month without going through a third country, according to the source familiar with the matter.The 55-year-old Thae, known as the No. 2 man at the North's embassy, has become one of the highest-level North Korean diplomats to desert the repressive regime, South Korea's unification ministry said Wednesday.\"Thae is believed to have expressed his intent to defect to South Korea,\" the source said. \"He is known to have directly flown to Seoul from London.\"The unification ministry said Thae defected because of his disillusionment with North Korea under leader Kim Jong-un and aspiration for freedom and democracy. Concerns for a better future for his children were also factored into his decision, it added.North Korean diplomats and workers at foreign nations are hard pressed to repatriate money to North Korea which faces tougher international sanctions over its nuclear and missile provocations.Thae Yong-ho (Yonhap)He was known to be in charge of promoting North Korea's national image in Britain in the face of international sanctions.Experts said that Thae might have been under huge pressure in doing his job amid sanctions including Washington's blacklisting of the North's leader over human rights abuses.Some analysts said that he might have chosen to desert the North's regime mainly because of concerns that his children, mostly raised in Europe, will have difficulty in adjusting to life in North Korea if they return to Pyongyang.Foreign media reports said that he was scheduled to return to North Korea this summer after a 10-year-stay in London. The Seoul government declined to confirm the reports.Another source said that the North's leader Kim has ordered the families of North Korean diplomats and overseas workers back to the country following Thae's defection. The move appears to be aimed at using them as hostages to curb further defections, it said. (Yonhap)","195":"North Korea is seeking to conduct another nuclear test around South Korea's presidential election next year, a high-profile North Korean defector has said, in the latest sign that Pyongyang would not abandon its nuclear program despite growing international pressure.Thae Yong-ho, a former No. 2 official at the North Korean embassy in London, said North Korea's foreign ministry has sent documents to its overseas missions that Pyongyang is seeking to carry out its sixth and seventh nuclear test by next year.\"In particular, it calls for preparations as North Korea would seek to conduct a nuclear test around the presidential election,\" Thae said Friday in a closed-door parliamentary intelligence committee session, according to lawmakers. It marked Thae's first public appearance since his defection to South Korea in July.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests this year alone following those in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Seoul's spy agency has said that Pyongyang is ready to carry out a sixth nuclear test at any time.Thae's comments illustrated Pyongyang's commitment to keep advancing its nuclear programs in defiance of growing UN sanctions and pressure.Thae added that the North's leader Kim Jong-un wants his country to be recognized as a nuclear state, such as Pakistan or India, a status rejected by South Korea and the U.S.\"After being recognized as a nuclear state, North Korea hopes to resolve pending issues through international dialogue,\" Thae said.The nuclear talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program were last held in 2008. There is no sign yet that the talks -- which involve the host China, South and North Korea, the US, Japan and Russia -- could resume anytime soon.He said that the North sees the prime time for getting the recognition in the early stages of the new US administration which means late 2017 or early 2018.South Korea is likely to hold a presidential election earlier than expected next year as parliament approved a motion on Dec. 9 to impeach Park over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court has up to six months to review whether to unseat or reinstate her.Park's single five-year term ends in February 2018 with the next presidential election originally slated for December 2017.Thae also said that North Korea hopes that Seoul may take a fresh approach toward Pyongyang under a new administration.\"Pyongyang hopes that doubts about the effectiveness of sanctions against North Korea gain traction in a short period of time. It wants South Korea to seek a new inter-Korean policy,\" he was quoted as saying by a South Korean lawmaker.Thae, a former minister at the North Korean embassy in London, is one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials to come to the South.Thae began his resettlement process in South Korea earlier in the day, after a monthslong investigation by Seoul's spy agency into reasons for his defection was completed.He told lawmakers Monday that he fled to South Korea due to his disillusionment with the regimented regime, under which many are living like slaves.(Yonhap)","196":"US President Barack Obama will visit China early next month for a summit of the Group of 20 countries and bilateral talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the White House said Thursday.The trip, set to begin on Sept. 2, comes as the US and China are at odds over maritime disputes in the South China Sea and the US plan to deploy the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.Obama will \"conduct in-depth meetings with President Xi Jinping of China in Hangzhou, where the two leaders will discuss a wide-range of global, regional, and bilateral issues,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement without elaborating.During the G-20 summit, Obama \"will emphasize the need to continue building on the progress made since 2009 in advancing strong, sustainable, and balanced global economic growth\" while underscoring the \"importance of G-20 cooperation in promoting a level playing field and broad-based economic opportunity,\" Earnest said.The G-20 summit is set for Sept. 4-5 in the southeastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. Obama's trip will highlight his \"ongoing commitment to the G-20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation as well as the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific,\" Earnest said.After China, Obama will visit Laos for annual regional summits led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- the US-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit -- as well as bilateral meetings with Lao President Bounnhang Vorachith, the White House said.China has strongly protested the decision by Washington and Seoul to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit in South Korea, saying the system, especially the powerful \"X-band\" radar, could be used against it, despite repeated US assurances the system is purely defensive and designed only to cope with North Korean threats.The issue has raised concern that China might be refusing to render full-scale cooperation for international efforts to increase pressure on Pyongyang, including implementing the latest UN Security Council sanctions resolution, in protest of the THAAD deployment decision.After the North's latest missile launches early this month, the US sought to have the Security Council adopt a press statement condemning the firings, but those efforts fell through due reportedly to Chinese insistence the statement also include opposition to THAAD's deployment.The US and China have also been at odds over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last month, an international tribunal rejected China's claims in a victory for the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations locked in maritime disputes with Beijing. But China has rejected the ruling. (Yonhap)","197":"Family members of the victims of the Sewol ferry sinking started Thursday a hunger strike to last for an indefinite period in protest against the government\u2019s decision to dissolve the Sewol Special Committee tasked with investigating the 2014 maritime disaster. Yoo Kyeong-geun, the father of the deceased student Ye-eun and the spokesperson for the families of Sewol victims, began the strike at 4 p.m. at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, calling for the extension of the Sewol Special Committee\u2019s term and the launch of a special prosecutors\u2019 team dedicated to probing the deadly accident. In a message posted on Facebook on Wednesday, Yoo urged opposition parties -- The Minjoo Party of Korea, People\u2019s Party and Justice Party -- to keep their pledges to pass a revision to the Sewol Special Act to allow the Sewol Committee\u2019s continued investigation into the cause of the ferry sinking. The government dissolved the Sewol Special Committee as of June 30, citing the Sewol Special Act that took effect on Jan. 1, 2015. The act allowed the committee to probe the nation\u2019s worst maritime disaster, which claimed 304 lives, for 18 months with another three months to report on their findings. The committee is comprised of members recommended by the rivaling parties, the bereaved families, the Supreme Court and the Korean Bar Association.A family member of a victim of the Sewol ferry disaster sobs in front of her deceased daughter\u2019s desk at a Memory Classroom, which has remained intact in honor of student victims, in Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. Letters, post-it memos, desks and chairs at 10 Memory Classrooms will be moved to Ansan Education Office this weekend. YonhapBut families of the victims and civic groups claim that the committee was not launched until Aug. 4, when it was allocated the budget and manpower to investigate the accident. They argue that by law the committee has eight more months to conduct the probe. \u201cWe, the victims of the Sewol ferry sinking, and Koreans thought that we could now rely on political parties when the opposition won a majority and promised to act together (to amend the Sewol Special Act),\u201d he said in the message. \u201cBut what we have seen so far are opposition lawmakers saying that they cannot ignore public sentiment and parliamentary procedures.\u201dThe three opposition parties have agreed on eight points regarding their legislative cooperation in early August. As for the Sewol ferry disaster, the parties agreed to push for extension of the Sewol Special Committee by August. But the Sewol victims\u2019 families view such an agreement as insufficient as the parties failed to agree on amending the Sewol Special Act or opening a special prosecutors\u2019 team. They also oppose the possibility that the Sewol Committee\u2019s authority to investigate the body of the ship will be transferred to another body. \u201cI am afraid because I know how painful it is to fast for a long time and my health is worse than it was two years ago,\u201d Yoo said in the message. \u201cBut what is more fearful is that the opposition parties will not be any better than the ruling Saenuri Party in salvaging the truth.\u201dYoo said that he will continue the strike until the opposition parties achieve their demands in parliament.Even though the Sewol Committee\u2019s term has officially ended and the government has stopped funding its activities, the majority of the investigators at the committee are still working as usual. Despite the government refusing to cooperate, the committee said Wednesday that it will bring in government officials from Cheong Wa Dae, the prosecution and the Maritime Ministry for questioning at the upcoming hearing scheduled for Sept. 1-2. The investigators will grill them over the process of the lifting of the ferry, alleged influence peddling in local media and the government\u2019s lukewarm efforts to save lives. The Sewol committee has found so far that the 6,835-ton ferry carried 2,215 tons of cargo, more than double its cargo limit of 987 tons at the time of its sinking.Some 15 family members of the Sewol victims staged a hunger strike in July 2014 for 46 days, demanding an amendment to the Sewol Special Act.

Ozone, a gas found in air pollution, is known to cause breathing attacks, indigestion and nausea in many people, especially children and seniors. In general, hot and sunny weather conditions increase the likelihood of high ozone concentrations. To avoid heat-related illnesses, the KCDC advised drinking plenty of fluids and wearing loose-fitting, lightweight clothing.

Security Council's tougher sanctions in March over its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month.The rare massive defection has garnered attention over whether the sanctions have a major impact on pressuring North Korea, as Pyongyang-run restaurants in foreign countries have served as one of main sources of hard currency for the North.But the case has also sparked a row in South Korea over whether they defected to Seoul of their own free will following North Korea's repeated claims that the female workers were abducted by Seoul's spy agency.The National Intelligence Service has held them under its protection without sending them to a state-run resettlement facility, saying that the case is a high-profile defection and North Korea is using it as propaganda.Usually, North Korean defectors receive three months of resettlement education at the facility named Hanawon after coming to South Korea.An association of progressive lawyers requested a local court to decide on the legality of Seoul's protection of the defectors in a bid to clarify North Korea's claim that they were kidnapped by Seoul.Restaurants operated by North Korea in foreign countries have served as one of the main sources of hard currency for the country.The North is suspected of using the money to bankroll its nuclear and missile programs.North Koreans employed by foreign restaurants are among the50,000 workers sent abroad by the regime to earn much-needed hard currency to help it tackle economic hardships amid the U.N. sanctions on the North.In the wake of the April defections, three more North Korean restaurant employees working in China escaped to Seoul in June.

The country\u2019s late first President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who was a medical aide, union leader and planter before being elected to the French Parliament, led the country toward independence. He is widely credited for his role in helping the continent\u2019s decolonization from European powers as well as maintaining close relations with West African nations and the West, particularly France. Following his death in 1993, the Ivory Coast underwent a coup and two religious civil wars that ended in 2011. On Oct. 25 last year, the country reelected President Alassane Ouattara, 74, a former American-trained economist and top official at the International Monetary Fund. According to the New York Times, Ouattara has guided the country\u2019s economic growth to surpass 8 percent over each of the last four years. His challenge is to \u201csustain such growth and spread it evenly across all regions as he tries to reconcile this still-divided nation,\u201d the Times noted. \u201cOur National Day is a privileged moment for all Ivorians, who patriotically express their vision of togetherness and commitment to make their country a land of peace, brotherhood and prosperity,\u201d Ivorian Ambassador Sylvestre Kouassi Bile said in a speech on Aug. 8. \u201cSharing the same values, the sons and daughters of Ivory Coast worked together to bring about a new dynamic in our country, which has reasserted its solid leadership in Africa.\u201d On the back of rapid national development, Ivory Coast -- among the largest economies in West Africa, with 23 million people and $32 billion in gross domestic product -- aims to join the ranks of emerging economies by 2020, he added.The ambassador stressed that two major events are scheduled this year: a referendum on constitutional reform aimed at reflecting Ivorian society\u2019s evolution and institutional improvements; and legislative elections for renewing deputies\u2019 mandate and strengthening democracy. The French-speaking nation was the first African state to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1961. President Ouattara visited Korea in October 2014 as the first Ivorian head of state on an official visit. In December last year, the Korea-Ivory Coast Economic Forum was held in the Ivory Coast\u2019s economic capital Abidjan, and in June this year, the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency opened an office there following the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The two countries recorded bilateral trade of $230 million last year, up from $120 million in 2012, according to the embassy. Twenty Korean companies are operating in Ivory Coast in the transport infrastructure, electronics and automotive industries. Hyundai Rotem and Dongsan Engineering will participate in an international consortium to construct the first suburban rail network in the country. The $1.45 billion project will link Abidjan\u2019s city center with its suburbs and the Felix Houphouet-Boigny International Airport. It is projected to carry 300,000 passengers per day along its 37 kilometers. Construction can begin next year and is expected to be completed by 2019 for operational service in 2020. Korean firm GS E&C; has been selected to complete building Abidjan\u2019s fifth major bridge.\u201cI cannot express enough how grateful Ivory Coast is to the Korean government for financing the national oncology center in Abidjan, which will allow quality care for people in West Africa,\u201d Bile added. Ivory Coast, which produces 45,000 barrels of oil per day, is devoting special attention to high-growth sectors of information and communications technology and renewable energy, he said. It is also the world\u2019s top exporter of cocoa and raw cashew nuts. The Ivorian government adopted its National Development Plan that spans 2016-2020 and encompasses major structural reforms intended to nurture sustainable and inclusive growth of the private sector.

The remaining lawmakers, meanwhile, have appointed an emergency leadership. \u201cThe new party will represent the true conservative (spirit) and set its core principles to center around citizens,\u201d Rep. Choung Byoung-gug said after a meeting of Saenuri defectors early Friday morning. Thirty-four Saenuri lawmakers announced their intention to defect en masse on Wednesday. They plan to officially leave the conservative ruling bloc next Tuesday. Tentatively called \u201cNew Conservative Party for Reform,\u201d the envisioned party will formally launch in the middle of next month before Lunar New Year\u2019s Day, around Jan. 20, Rep. Choung said. The new party is open to coalition with other political parties and lawmakers, the lawmaker said.\u00a0Former Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung (left) and the former party whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min attend a meeting held to discuss a plan to establish their own political party on Friday. (Yonhap)Two former Saenuri Party chiefs, Reps. Kim Moo-sung and Yoo Seong-min -- who are among the 34 -- have made clear their intentions to join the new group, although the exact number of founding members had not yet been revealed Tuesday, explained Rep. Hwang Yeong-cheul, who had been speaking for the group of defectors. The move came as an internal feud between two party factions -- a larger group still loyal to President Park Geun-hye and more reform-minded members critical of the scandal-ridden president -- deepened following the Dec. 9 impeachment of Park. The conservative president has been mired in an explosive political scandal, accused of having allowed her civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs and having colluded with her to extort funds from major conglomerates. Also on Friday, pro-president lawmakers remaining with the Saenuri Party appointed a new head for its emergency leadership committee -- a pastor named In Myeong-jin who formerly chaired the party\u2019s ethics committee. \u201cThe party\u2019s factions have crossed the Rubicon,\u201d said Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik, expressing disappointment at the dissenters\u2019 plan to form their own party.Rep. Cho Won-jin, a pro-President Park loyalist, called it a \u201cgroundless and irresponsible act.\u201d The Saenuri Party is currently the largest political party in South Korea by representation, controlling 128 seats of the 300-member National Assembly. After the breakup, its presence will be reduced to 94. The party has been suffering from dwindling public support since the presidential scandal erupted in October. In a poll, conducted by RealMeter between Monday and Wednesday, public support of the party stood at 20.2 percent, rising 3 percentage points from the previous week. The Saenuri Party\u2019s main opposition rival, the Democratic Party of Korea, garnered 35 percent in the same poll. Saenuri defectors, conscious of widespread voter disillusionment with the conservatives who have been in power for two consecutive administrations, said their new party will be \u201ctotally reformed\u201d and will open their headquarters to citizens. \u201cWe will reject any kind of hegemonies, regardless of who becomes the party chief. The headquarters would be like an open square for people to share opinions,\u201d said Rep. Hwang.The party members would chip in the funds for the new party while it also brings in citizens\u2019 donations. The appointment of the party chief and other leadership positions will be decided in the launch process, he added.

This is a 30 percent rise from last year.The surge is caused by the sweltering heat, during which the mites, named Haemaphysalis longicornis, become more active.The SFTS virus infection was first reported in the country in 2013, leading to 17 deaths among 36 patients. The number increased from 55 infected patients with 16 dead in 2014 to 79 infected cases with 21 dead in 2015. There is currently no vaccine or cure to treat the virus contracted from the mites. According to experts, humid and hot weather makes it easy for the mites to reproduce. The recent heat wave has led to at least 1 1\/2 times more mites found outdoors, they added.Haemaphysalis longicornis (Yonhap)Ten of the infected cases occurred in Daegu, where the daytime temperature soared to 36 degrees Celsius over the weekend.\u201cThe government should speed up the process to develop plans to curb the increasing number of mites, along with research in vaccine and treatment to prevent the rise in the number of health damages each year,\u201d said Lee Hoi-sun, a professor of bioenvironmental chemistry at Chonbuk National University.Main symptoms of SFTS include high fever, nausea, diarrhea and stomach cramps.Since the symptoms are similar to those of flu, it is important to visit a hospital as soon as possible if there is persistent high fever, experts said. As mites mainly inhabit places along the riverside and near barns of livestock, experts encouraged people to stay away from such areas. For those who cannot avoid visiting such places, such as those who work on farms, they advised wearing long sleeves and taking a shower immediately afterward.By Kim Da-sol(ddd@heraldcorp.com)","209":"South Korea\u2019s seasonal influenza among young patients shows no sign of abating, reaching a record-high number of flu patients this week since the government began monitoring in 1997.According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a record high number of young patients were diagnosed with flu in the past week as of Friday. Per 1,000 outpatient and emergency room visits of those aged 7-18, 153 were flu patients. The previous record was set in 2013 at 115 flu cases per 1,000 hospital visits.\u00a0A nurse examines a child at a pediatrics clinic in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)A total number of suspected cases for seasonal influenza reached 61.8 patients per 1,000 visits across the nation, about a 77 percent jump from 34.8 cases, the KCDC said. By age group, those aged six or below showed the highest number of infected cases at 59.6 patients, followed by those aged 19-49 at 51.5.Those aged 65 or more showed the least number of flu cases at nine per 1,000 hospital visits, followed by those aged 50-64 with 22.2 cases. The virus currently raging is the influenza A virus subtype H3N2, the doctors said.While doctors stress that simple hygiene etiquette is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the contagious virus, they said that the influenza B virus is likely to appear early next year.\u201cSeasonal flu shows different types of aspects of spreading and considering the current spread of influenza A, the second round of seasonal flu -- influenza B -- may begin spreading early next year,\u201d said Doctor Jung Yong-pil of Asan Medical Center.\u201cThese two different strains of the virus share almost identical symptoms such as high fever, headache and muscle pain,\u201d Jung added. Getting a vaccination, either a flu shot or a nasal-spray type vaccination, is a simple method to reduce the chances of catching both influenza A and B, experts say, but fundamental preventive steps such as washing hands often can sometimes work better.According to Doctor Lee Jae-gab of Hallym University Gangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, it is difficult to expect which subtype virus of influenza B would spreading, making it hard to guess which vaccination to get for prevention.\u201cThere are two subtypes of virus under influenza A and B, while a vaccination cannot always create the specific antibodies to resist the viruses, it depends on people,\u201d Lee said.\u201cThat\u2019s why doctors stress flu prevention methods, such as wearing a mask and washing hands often, as the most certain and basic ways to stay away from a cold,\u201d he added.The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced earlier this week that it would temporarily expand the health insurance coverage for those aged 10-18, so they can get antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu at a 30 percent discount and promptly receive treatment.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","210":"South Korea's government on Tuesday said it has agreed with Hong Kong to simplify the automated immigration procedures for each other starting next week, by eliminating the mandatory online preregistration.The Ministry of Justice said South Korean nationals and Hong Kong citizens will be able to use the automated immigration system when visiting each other's countries without preregistering online starting Monday.Under the new plan, South Koreans aged 17 or older visiting Hong Kong can register their biometric information, including fingerprints and facial images, at Hong Kong International Airport after going through a face-to-face inspection.

An official from Brazil's foreign affairs ministry, however, told Yonhap News Agency on Aug. 10 that the meeting with Choe and Temer never took place.Choe, the vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, was in Rio de Janeiro from Aug. 4-10 to take part in the Summer Olympics. Choe's visit had been seen as a move to carry out sports diplomacy in a bid to break away from international isolation caused by Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missile development.

Its morning low was 29 degrees Celsius.The KMA said Sunday that Seoul saw a total of 16 days stricken by the heat wave since June 1, the highest number since 29 days were observed in 1994.Heat wave days as classified as when the daytime high reaches over 33 degrees Celsius. People walk past a pedestrian crossing while the air simmers over a road amid the heat wave that has swept across South Korea. YonhapThe KMA added that heat wave warnings were announced for 11 consecutive days this year. The warning is announced when the temperature hits 35 degrees Celsius and continues for at least two consecutive days. The tropical night phenomena also continued for almost every day during the past month, with the nighttime low at over 25 degrees Celsius, it added.The KMA said earlier this month that the record-breaking hot summer weather had been influenced by weather in northern China.It explained that heated air that was created in northern China had risen to a high altitude and moved across southern Russia and the Korean Peninsula, before descending on South Korea. The migration happened at the same time as a high pressure system formed over South Korea, preventing the formation of clouds and exposing the country to more sunlight.The KMA said that it was eyeing typhoon Chanthu, which was moving northward from near Tokyo as of Monday afternoon. Although typhoon Chanthu would not have a direct influence on the peninsula, the KMA said that it expects to see changes in atmosphere that could bring the temperature down.Meanwhile, the government said Friday the country\u2019s total electricity use has set a new record.The maximum electricity usage soared to 85.18 million kilowatts on Friday, surpassing the previous record of 84.97 million kilowatts set Thursday.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the electric power reserve ratio also went down to 7.22 million kilowatts.If the figure falls below 5 million kilowatts, a state alarm is automatically issued.Local retailers also said they saw record-high sales of air conditioners and fans, as consumers tried to cope with the hot weather. According to local electronic goods retailer Lotte Hi-Mart, this summer saw the highest number of air conditioners sold since 2012.

Born in 1983 in South Korea, she grew up in Oregon after being adopted by a couple in the U.S. in 1986. Ever since she was 3, Davidson would constantly daydream about her birth mother throughout her childhood.\u201cI remember wishing every night she would come back,\u201d the 33-year-old, who currently lives in Everett, Washington, told The Korea Herald. \u201cI\u2019ve never remembered a time that I did not miss her and want to be with her. My adoptive mother told me that when I was 4 years old I was crying because I could not remember what my mother\u2019s face looked like anymore.\u201dAbout 30 years after she left Korea, Davidson was surprised to learn earlier this month that she had finally located her birth mother.\u00a0 On Aug. 3, on a whim, she transferred her DNA information to a free third-party website called GEDmatch where DNA information collected from Korean birth families is shared by a group of Korean adoptees. She had obtained her DNA information two years ago and kept it in a different database. \u201cBy the next morning I saw that I had a very close match and within 48 hours I was talking to my mother on KakaoTalk,\u201d she said.Davidson was adopted by her adoptive parents in the U.S. at the age of 3 and grew up in Oregon. (Kyung Eun Davidson)Davidson is the first Korean adoptee to have found her birth mother through the DNA matching service provided by 325Kamra, a nonprofit group comprised mainly of mixed-race Korean adoptees in the U.S. The testing was launched earlier this year to help Korean adoptees learn more about their heritage as well as to help those with positive DNA matches to potentially reunite.In April, the organization brought 300 DNA kits to Korea, one of which was given to Davidson\u2019s birth mother. After just about three months since her mother\u2019s DNA was collected and uploaded on GEDmatch, they were able to find each other.\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing, crazy and wonderful experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that Kyung Eun didn\u2019t have to do anything other than provide her sample, as did her mom, shows how effective our methodology is,\u201d said Bella L. Siegel-Dalton, a representative of 325Kamra.\u00a0\u201cHad Kyung Eun transferred her results to GEDmatch sooner, she would\u2019ve known sooner. Her mother\u2019s DNA was sitting in the database waiting for her. Right now there are over 100 (birth) families\u2019 DNA samples also waiting.\u201dThe game changer\u00a0South Korea remains one of the largest sources of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. Ever since the nation\u2019s adoption law was revised in 2012, guaranteeing an adoptee\u2019s right to request his or her birth records, those asking for their personal files to find their birth families have increased dramatically. While 258 adoptees asked to see their information in 2012, 1,324 did so last year. However, only 14.7 percent of some 4,790 adoptees who requested their files between 2012 and 2015 were able to reunite with their families, according to data released by Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the Minjoo Party of Korea. One of the biggest reasons behind this is the mass forgery of documents in the 1970s and \u201980s in Korea -- children\u2019s identities were falsified before they were sent overseas for adoption. Many adoptees acquire their birth records only to find out information in them is incorrect. A lot of them are also told lies or turned away when they ask for information at adoption agencies, although the Korean law currently guarantees their right to access their files. For adoptees born in the \u201950s and \u201960s whose birth parents have reached old age, their time is running out. Since 2012, the South Korean government has been offering assistance to adoptees in their search for their birth family. But Siegel-Dalton from 325Kamra said the service has been extremely ineffective. \u201cThe program is understaffed and relies on paperwork and files that are often incorrect,\u201d she told The Korea Herald. \u201cDNA is the only foolproof way of ensuring a true match. Even if the birth parents are deceased, a close family member can test and reunite the adoptees with their birth family, such as cousins, uncles and grandparents.\u201dDavidson in fact stayed in Korea from 2005-2007 to find her birth mother. But when she visited her adoption agency, Holt, the staff said they couldn't give her information about her mother without her birth father\u2019s consent. Davidson did reunite with her birth father, who gave her up for adoption when she was 3, but after their first meeting in 2007 he soon disappeared without telling her anything about her mother\u2019s whereabouts. Devastated, Davidson returned to the U.S. that year, feeling like there was nothing left for her in Korea. \u201cI grew up wondering what was so wrong with me that my own parents didn\u2019t want me. It felt like confirmation that there was something about me that was unlovable,\u201d she said, when asked about how she felt about her father walking away. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my father I lost, but also any hope of finding my mother,\u201d she said. Earlier this month Davidson realized once again that Holt had lied to her about how she was given up for adoption. In 2006, the agency had told Davidson by email that her birth mother had made a \u201chuge scene at her father\u2019s workplace and then abandoned her on his door step.\u201d But in 2007 her father told her a different account. This month, Davidson learned her birth mother never agreed to put her up for adoption. \u201cMy mother told me she did not know I had been given up for adoption until eight years ago,\u201d she said.\u2018I would\u2019ve never let her go\u2019Lee Eun-soo (not her real name), Davidson\u2019s birth mother, thought for more than 20 years that her daughter was being raised by her father or his family. She raised Davidson alone for the first three years of her daughter\u2019s life, and decided to have her raised by her father whom she thought was more financially capable of supporting her. \u201cI breastfed her until she was 3,\u201d she told The Korea Herald. \u201cShe was all I had. It was just me and her in our little room.\u201dEvery year, she would call him on Davidson\u2019s birthday to ask him to wish her \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d \u201cHe would always say something like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s doing fine,\u2019\u201d Lee\u00a0said. \u201cI would\u2019ve never let her go if I knew he was going to put her up for adoption. I never gave him my consent.\u201dIt was in 2008 that Lee found out her daughter was never registered in the father\u2019s family registry. When she asked for an explanation and demanded to see her daughter, Davidson\u2019s father confessed that he had given her up for adoption in the \u201980s.Shocked, Lee visited Holt that year, but the agency did not tell her that Davidson had lived in Korea from 2005-2007, and that she had visited the agency to search for her too.\u00a0 Kyung Eun Davidson, the first Korean adoptee to have found her birth mother through the DNA matching service provided by 325Kamra. (Kyung Eun Davidson)\u201cI was really surprised to learn (earlier this month) that my daughter was living in Korea in the 2000s,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one, including her father who apparently met her in 2007, ever told me anything.\u201dLawyer So Ra-mi from Gonggam Public Interest Lawyers said all birth parents should be able to access their children\u2019s records, especially if they were put up for adoption without their consent. The current Special Adoption Law does not state anything on birth parents\u2019 right to request to see their children\u2019s adoption files as well as to get in touch with them. While this does not mean birth parents have no legal grounds to access the records, So said a revised version of the law could specifically guarantee birth parents\u2019 right to information on their children\u2019s adoption. The bill is to be submitted for review to the National Assembly by the end of this year.Katherine Kim Bradtke, another representative of 325Kamra, said DNA testing is what bypasses the dependency on adoption agencies for information.\u201cIt completely circumvents the nonsense that agencies give to birth families and adoptees,\u201d she said. \u2018Government\u2019s responsibility\u2019The South Korean government -- not a nongovernmental organization -- should set up a central DNA bank and take full responsibility for having \u201cendorsed, institutionalized and legitimized the adoption of 200,000 Koreans to the West,\u201d said Tobias Hubinette, a Korean adoptee and associate professor of intercultural studies at Karlstad University in Sweden.The Korean government should also encourage adoptees as well as their birth parents and relatives to register and take DNA tests, he added. \u201cIf any country has an experience with broken and separated families, it is South Korea after decades of national division, mass overseas emigration and mass internal migration with hundreds of thousands of people searching for missing relatives,\u201d said Hubinette, who is also a member of Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea.Hosu Kim, an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, as well as lawyer So Ra-mi, said the DNA information of Korean adoptees and their birth families should be archived and protected by a state-run agency. \u201cOf course it\u2019s something that the government should be doing, but they didn\u2019t even start on it for such a long time,\u201d said Professor Kim. \u201cIf the government can\u2019t (offer a DNA matching service) because they lack experience, one way is to support those who can and who have the experience.\u201dThe state-run Korean Adoption Services currently has a pop-up page on their website that offers information on 325Kamra\u2019s free DNA testing service for Korean birth families. Still, 325Kamra has only managed to collect some 100 DNA test kits from Korea. They brought 300 kits from the U.S. in April, but there are still many left unused at KoRoot, a guesthouse in Seoul where birth families can take the tests for free. Bradtke said more promotion is needed to get birth families tested. \u201cWe are aware that some suggestions have been made on DNA testing for adoptees and birth families and that the government should be doing more or even be in charge of the matching service,\u201d said Kim Moon-jeong from the KAS, the Korean government agency that is in charge of adoption policies and birth family searches. \u201cAt this point we can\u2019t make any statements on the matter.\u201dRegardless, Bradtke encouraged all Korean adoptees who have already tested their DNA to upload their information on GEDmatch. She stressed anyone can use the site regardless of what DNA kit they used -- such as 23andme, FTDNA and ancestry.com -- and this can help them reunite with their birth families. Davidson and her mother also used different kits -- she used a 23andme kit two years ago, while her mother used a FTDNA kit provided by 325Kamra -- but the site still managed to notice they were a match, she said. \u201cWe know our system works. We just need to collect DNA from more birth families in Korea as well as from Korean adoptees worldwide.\u201d\u2018Life\u2019s dream come true\u2019 Davidson said the constant upheaval in her childhood made it difficult for her to form lasting attachments with people. When she arrived in the U.S., she had scabies, lice and chickenpox which she developed during her days in an orphanage while waiting for her adoption. \u201cMy adoptive mother was furious about the condition I arrived in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has taken me a very long time to trust people, because I always feel like they are going to leave me. \u2026 It made relationships very difficult.\u201dEven as a 3-year-old, losing her family and leaving her home country at the same time was a painful experience, she said. Davidson said she had Korean mannerisms and habits that were ingrained in her even from that short period in her life. When she arrived in the U.S., she refused to sleep on her bed for a while and insisted she wanted to sleep on the floor -- the way she used to in Korea. \u201cI used to always cover my mouth when I laughed (as girls were often taught to do in Korea),\u201d she said. \u201cI consciously made myself stop doing that in high school when my classmates told me they didn\u2019t like it.\u201dShe said finding her birth mother lessened the impact of her birth father walking away.\u00a0Davidson and her mother\u00a0are currently planning to meet in person.\u201cRationally, I knew that my father didn\u2019t disappear because I was unlovable. However, it was hard not to feel that it was my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cSince my birth mother found me, I finally feel like she did love and has always loved me. \u2026 I was so happy. It was a life\u2019s dream come true.\u201dDavidson said adoption agencies in Korea do not seem to know that their responsibility is to children and adoptees first and foremost. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what is best for us. We do,\u201d she said, recalling her experience during her search at Holt. \u201cWe are not commodities or products and their responsibility is not to their business or biological parents, but to us.\u201dAfter 30 years of separation, the first thing Davidson told her mother, over KakaoTalk, was: \u201cI miss you. I\u2019ve always missed you.\u201d By Claire Lee\u00a0 (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","214":"South Korea's national flag will take center stage in this year's Liberation Day celebrations, the Seoul metropolitan government said Sunday.The municipal authorities and ward officials said they will prominently use the Taegeukgi, South Korea's flag, to highlight the people's love of their country and liberation from the oppressive Japanese colonial rule (1910-45).\"The goal is to cover the city with a wave of Taegeukgi to mark the national holiday that falls on Monday,\" a Seoul city official said.

The flag symbolizes harmony, peace, purity, and the \"four classic elements\" of the heaven, sun, moon and earth.The Taegeukgi signed by independence fighters displayed at Seoul city hall. (Yonhap)An enlarged version of the flag used by freedom fighters that fought Japanese occupiers has been set up at the outer wall at city hall. The flag is signed with the names of 70 fighters who also expressed their firm resolve to liberate the country from Japanese rule and give up their lives for the fatherland.In addition, a floral version of the national flag measuring 5.2 meters tall and 7 m wide has been erected at the Gwanghwamun thoroughfare in downtown Seoul. This is decorated with more than 9,000 flowers of all types.The city authorities then said that they plan to advance the national flag spirit further this year by hosting a bicycle event at parks along the Han River where people will be given small Taegeukgis that they can put on their bikes. It said some 2,000 flags will be distributed on Monday with bikers given the option of selecting from three trails: 18 kilometers, 51 km and 80 km.Besides the city, Gangnam, Songpa, Yongsan and other wards have kicked off their own flag campaigns to get people to hoist people in their homes and buildings.Gangnam ward, south of the Han River, has launched a drive to have the Taegeukgi hoisted on 90 percent of all homes and buildings in its jurisdiction.Others have set up pinwheels using the national flag motif and have erected a tunnel made from painted gourds. Some are planning to allow citizens to walk and wave flags in celebration along boulevards blocked to traffic.In addition, Lotte Tower, which will be South Korea's highest skyscraper when it opens next year, has been displaying a 20-by-20-m flag on its outer wall since last week, with a slogan of encouragement to the people.

It's unclear what made him take on the issue, but he met with a group of Pentagon officials a day earlier. The remark suggests the incoming administration would provide active support for the Pentagon to modernize nuclear weapons, an expensive project that reportedly could cost as much as $1 trillion over the next 30 years.Earlier Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin also called for bolstering \"strategic nuclear forces,\" especially those capable of penetrating \"existing and future missile defense systems.\" US media said the remarks by Trump and Putin suggest a new nuclear arms race.Trump's remark represents a stark departure from Obama's policy on nuclear weapons. Obama has championed a nuclear-free world, seeking to make the initiative a key legacy of his presidency. He launched the Nuclear Security Summit of world leaders aimed at reducing the stockpile of fissile material and keeping it out of the hands of terrorists, and the fourth and last Nuclear Security Summit was held in Washington earlier this year.Obama even considered officially declaring the US won't use nuclear weapons first, even though he dropped the so-called nuclear \"no first use\" proposal in the face of concerns and objections from allies and senior officials.On the contrary, Trump even suggested at one point during the campaign that South Korea and Japan could be allowed to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce American burden of helping defend the key Asian allies.The remarks had been one of the biggest sources of criticism for Trump, fueling calls in South Korea for nuclear weapons development that have arisen in the wake of North Korea's fifth nuclear test in January.Since the election, however, Trump has denied ever making those remarks. (Yonhap)","223":"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump is now accusing President Barack Obama of founding the Islamic State group that is wreaking havoc from the Middle East to European cities.\"In many respects, you know, they honor President Obama,'' Trump said Wednesday during a raucous campaign rally outside Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \"He is the founder of ISIS.\"He repeated the allegation three more times for emphasis.Trump also pointedly referred to the president by his full legal name: Barack Hussein Obama.The Republican presidential nominee in the past has accused his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, of founding the militant group. Shiftingt he blame to Obama on Wednesday, he said \"crooked Hillary Clinton\" was actually the group's co-founder.As he works to keep his campaign message on track, Trump in recent days has sometimes tried to clarify controversial statements by arguing he was being misinterpreted. But given the opportunity Thursday morning to walk his statement back, Trump did the opposite. \"He was the founder, absolutely the founder,\" Trump said on CNBC. \"In fact he gets the -- in sports, they have awards. He gets the most valuable player award.''Trump has long blamed Obama and his former secretary of state _ Clinton _ for pursuing Mideast policies that created a power vacuum in Iraq that was exploited by IS, another acronym for the group. He's sharply criticized Obama for announcing he would pull U.S. troops out of Iraq, a decision that many Obama critics say created the kind of instability in which extremist groups like IS thrive.The White House declined to comment on Trump's accusation.The Islamic State group began as Iraq's local affiliate of al-Qaida, the group that attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. The group carried out massive attacks against Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority, fueling tensions with al-Qaida's central leadership. The local group's then-leader, Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in 2006 in a U.S. airstrike but is still seen as the Islamic State group's founder.Trump's accusation -- and his use of the president's middle name, Hussein -- echoed previous instances where he's questioned Obama's loyalties.In June, when a shooter who claimed allegiance to IS killed 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub, Trump seemed to suggest Obama was sympathetic to the group when he said Obama \"doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands.\" In the past, Trump has also falsely suggested Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya, where Obama's father was from.The president, a Christian, was born in Hawaii.Trump lobbed the allegation midway through his rally at a sports arena, where riled-up supporters shouted obscenities about Clinton and joined in unison to shout ``lock her up.'' He railed against the fact that the Orlando shooter's father, Seddique Mateen, was spotted in the crowd behind Clinton during a Monday rally in Florida, adding, \"Of course he likes Hillary Clinton.\"Sitting behind Trump at his rally on Wednesday was former Rep.

The result has been attributed to the growing diplomatic row between South Korea and China over the planned deployment of an advanced U.S. missile shield in the country. The survey conducted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies from Aug. 1-3 showed the Chinese president received 4.47 points on the 0-10 scale designed to gauge the favorability of foreign heads of state.In the same poll last month, Xi received 4.85 and the corresponding figure for June stood at 4.81, the report by Asan researchers Kang Chung-ku and Woo Jung-yeop, said. The poll result is based on telephone interviews of 1,000 South Korean adults aged 19 or older.The dwindling popularity reflects fraying ties between Seoul and Beijing over the U.S-led plan to deploy a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea by the end of 2017.China has made clear its objection to the deployment which it said severely impairs Beijing's security interests in the region.South Korea and the U.S., however, counter the claim, saying the deployment is purely defensive against North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threats. As the feud worsened, several entertainment events by South Korean stars were called off in China while the Chinese government shut down a Chinese visa agency serving South Koreans seeking multi-entry Chinese visas earlier this month.\"It seems that the public opinion (toward Xi) worsened in the face of China's continued attacks on the South Korean government's THAAD deployment decision,\" the researchers said. The poll also showed United States Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Clinton is far more favored by South Koreans than her Republican rival Donald Trump.The poll put Clinton\u2019s popularity at 5.94 points while Trump received just 1.87 points. The main reason behind South Koreans' preference for Clinton appears to lie in their \"discomfort\" with Trump's negative comments on the U.S.' free trade agreement with South Korea and the allies' defense cost sharing, the institute said of the poll results. \"Media coverage of Trump stressing only America's interests in an isolationist perspective cast Clinton in a more positive light,\u201d he institute said.President Barack Obama's high approval rating, currently at around 54 percent, also contributed to the favorable results for Clinton, who belongs to the same Democratic Party as the president, the findings claimed.Still, local public opinion could change in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election because the two presidential competitors have yet to come up with detailed policies on Korean issues, the institute said.The latest poll, meanwhile, put the favorability of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at 1 point. Japan's prime minister was rated at a slightly higher 1.8 points.

Syring, the director of the MDA, addressed concerns about the negative repercussions on having the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the Korean peninsula. Vice Admiral James D. Syring\/ Joint Press Corp.Such worries encompass possibly vexing China by installing a U.S.-operated radar that could extend into its territory, THAAD\u2019s effectiveness in intercepting the missiles and possible damage on the environment and health of the people adjacent to its AN\/TPY-2 radar.\u201cThe intent of the system (THAAD) is to intercept North Korean ballistic missiles. Our missile defense system is not designed against China. Never has been and never will,\u201d Syring said, in a joint interview with local reporters. \u201cWe don\u2018t defend against China as a threat.\u201dChina has raised concern that having its biggest rival operate an advanced weapons system at a stone\u2019s throw away would infringe upon its strategic interest. One of its main concerns was the AN\/TPY-2 radar that can reportedly potentially detect up to 2,000 kilometers, when operated in the forward-based mode. To be operated within the THAAD system, the radar has to be in terminal mode that has much shorter range and cannot cover Chinese territory. But it is possible to transfer between the two modes.While Syring said that it is possible to transform for a short time \u201cfrom a material standpoint,\u201d he stressed that the radars will only function in the terminal mode.He added that THAAD in the Korean peninsula will not be part of the wider missile defense network utilized by the U.S. \u201cAny linkage to a wider purpose through C2BMC (command, control, battle management, and communications) is just not the case... The intent is for THAAD in Korea to operate autonomously,\u201d Syring said. The C2BMC program is an integrating element of the ballistic missile defense system.The MDA director stressed that the THAAD has been assessed not to have detrimental effects on human health or the environment.But he also said that the THAAD\u2019s capacity to intercept intermediate-range missiles like Musudan -- which is presumed to have range of 3,000 kilometers and is evaluated to have been successfully launched this year -- has not been test-proven yet.

According to the professor, North Korea engaged in vigorous business activities for various economic development projects last year, but so far this year it has not been able to draw in investments due to the international sanctions imposed on the country.Before the nuclear test, North Korea reported that foreign firms showed interest in holding business talks, particularly in regards to the Mubong and Onsong economic development zones, which are located near its border with China.Curtis Melvin, a North Korean economy researcher, said in an email to the VOA that there has not been any notable change in the North's economic zones as judged by satellite imagery. Melvin is a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University and a contributor to 38 North.

China had wanted the statement to say that a new ballistic missile interception base should not be deployed on the Korean Peninsula on the pretext of North Korea's military provocations, according to sources.The Chinese demand, however, was rejected by veto-wielding U.S., raising the possibility that the statement will wane, the sources said.\u00a0(Yonhap)Adoption of a UNSC statement requires a consensus among all member countries, including the five permanent members like the U.S. and China. The latest U.S.-China confrontation at the UNSC reflects growing concerns that their diplomatic feuds over the THAAD deployment plan would undermine efforts to present a united front against North Korea's broadening military provocations and nuclear weapons ambition.South Korea and the U.S. have insisted that the THAAD deployment, scheduled by the end of 2017, is defensive in nature and is being undertaken in the face of North Korea's worsening nuclear and missile threats. China vehemently counters the allies' arguments and argued the deployment of the missile shield impairs its strategic interest in the region. Briefly following North Korea's two ballistic missile launches last week, the Security Council convened an emergency meeting, but failed to swiftly come up with a statement to condemn the provocations.In the absence of joint action, U.N. envoys of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan held an ad hoc press conference to voice their joint criticism of the North Korean missile launches.

In addition, the North's report that Choe Ryong-hae met with the interim Brazilian leader turned out to be false.Choe, who holds the title of vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, arrived in Rio de Janeiro last Thursday (local time) to attend the Olympics, local sources said. His visit has been seen as a move to take full advantage of the Olympics to carry out sports diplomacy in a bid to break away from international isolation following Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missile development. Choe Ryong-hae, vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, leaves Sambodromo in Rio de Janeiro on Aug. 10, after watching the women's individual archery competition at the 31st Summer Olympic Games. (Yonhap)However, Choe, who doubles as the head of North Korea's commission for physical culture and sports, seems to have had little activity in meeting with influential political figures, and has restricted himself to watching North Korean athletes' perform and going on sightseeing trips.Choe on Tuesday visited Sambodromo, where the archery events are taking place, and watched compatriot Kang Un-ju performing in the women's individual archery qualification rounds. He then went to Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre to watch the women's synchronized 10m platform diving final where North Koreans Kim Kuk-hyang and Kim Mi-rae competed. On Monday, Choe watched table tennis player Kim Song-i and toured the Christ the Redeemer statue on Corcovado Mountain, the iconic tourist attraction in Rio. Wearing a black suit, he was with Kim Chol-hak, North Korea's ambassador to Brazil, and other four officials. The senior official on Sunday was at Riocentro-Pavillion 2 to watch weightlifter Om Yun-chol's performance. But after Om failed to defend his Olympic gold, Choe left the venue and didn't watch the weightlifter receiving the silver medal from Chang Ung, the lone North Korean International Olympic Committee member. Choe did meet with some top figures from around the world on the eve of the Olympic opening ceremony. He attended the gala dinner hosted by the IOC where U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, French President Fran?ois Hollande, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the IOC President Thomas Bach were present.Pyongyang's state-run Korean Central News Agency, meanwhile, reported on Sunday that Choe \"separately met\" with Bach and International Judo Federation President Marius Vizer on the day of the gala dinner. The KCNA also said Choe on Friday met with Interim Brazilian President Michel Temer and expressed the North's willingness to \"develop friendly and cooperative relations with Brazil.\" North Korea and Brazil established diplomatic ties in March 2001.However, an official from Brazil's foreign affairs ministry told Yonhap News Agency that the meeting with Choe and Temer never took place on Friday. \"We know there's a high-ranking North Korean official in Rio, but he didn't separately meet with Temer,\" an official said Tuesday on condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the issue. \"We can't also tell whether Choe's side tried to contact top Brazilian officials, but was denied a meeting.\" It was widely expected that the North will try to show that it is a normal country and improve its external image through the Olympics. After sanctions from the international community, Choe was expected to meet with global leaders in Rio and explain the overall situation facing the country and defend its actions. Sources following Choe in Rio said he is staying at a hotel that is outside of the downtown area. His room is apparently next to where Kwon Sung-chol, former North Korean ambassador to Cuba, is staying. An official from hotel said not many foreign VIPs are staying here due to security concerns. Choe is known to be staying at this hotel until Thursday. (Yonhap)","232":"The ruling Saenuri Party\u2019s new leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun began his political career in 1985 by joining the Democratic Justice Party, South Korea\u2019s ruling party, where he was a rank-and-file member from 1980 to 1988. He then joined the Saenuri Party\u2019s precursor Grand National Party and won his first lawmaker\u2019s seat in 2008 through proportional representation.\u00a0 Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the newly-elected leader of Saenuri Party, speaks while campaigning for the ruling party leadership last Wednesday in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. (Yonhap)Lee came into the spotlight after running in the 2012 election as a conservative candidate representing the liberal stronghold Gwangju. Though he was defeated by a narrow margin, his bid was hailed as a rare attempt to break the nation\u2019s entrenched regionalism. Although without a parliamentary seat, Lee secured himself a solid place in the party by acting as a trusted mouthpiece for then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye. His humble manner, candor and close relations with the media helped Park through a number of campaign struggles.In 2013, he was appointed as senior presidential secretary for political affairs, and afterwards, served as the senior secretary for public relations until he ran in the 2014 by-election. He was elected in South Jeolla Province, becoming the first conservative politician to be elected in the southern region since 1985. The 57-year-old politician is viewed as a staunch loyalist to President Park and this has often put him in the hot seat. In June, Lee was accused of having attempted to manipulate a public broadcaster\u2019s coverage about the Sewol tragedy in favor of the government.\u00a0By Yeo Jun-suk(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","233":"A photo of a coffee bar in Pyongyang carried by Chosun Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper published in Japan. (Yonhap)North Koreans in the capital city of Pyongyang are three times as rich as those in other areas, South Korea's state-run think tank said Thursday, in the latest sign of the deepening economic divide in the communist country.Pyongyang's per capita gross domestic product is estimated to be at between $2,658 and $2,715 as of 2008, compared with a range of $791 and $1,213 in the South Hwanghae Province in the country's southwest, the Korea Development Institute (KDI) said in a report.Since 2008, North Korea has been one of the poorest countries with a per capita GDP of only $1,000 on the purchasing power parity basis, the report said.The KDI said its findings were based on estimates of the share of solid fuel used in cooking in North Korea as that type of energy is closely linked to the public's income level and is considered a relatively significant method in gauging the real income in underdeveloped countries with little statistical infrastructure.Children in a North Korean rural area. (AP-Yonhap file photo)As of 2008, North Korean households who use firewood to cook account for 47 percent, while coal-using households make up 46 percent, the KDI said, adding that it means that almost all North Koreans are given no access to modern energy sources, such as electricity, gas and oil.The KDI also said about 88 percent of North Koreans aged 20-59 are officially employed in socialist sectors.Still, the actual share of the employed population who can afford a decent living is estimated at between 31 percent and 62 percent, the KDI said, citing North Korea's 2008 census.In comparison, the share of the officially employed population aged 20-59 in Pyongyang is 85 percent, while the real employed population stands at between 61 percent and 85 percent.The KDI said its findings imply that Pyongyang holds a very special position in North Korea in terms of income, as well as real employment.

They also give bribes to security officials.\u00a0(Yonhap)","236":"U.S. renunciation of the preemptive nuclear strike option would be \"deeply destabilizing\" at a time when Russia is flexing its military muscles, China is building up its nuclear forces and North Korea is bent on developing nuclear missiles, a top security expert said Monday.Andrew Shearer, senior Asia Pacific security adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, raised the concern as the administration of President Barack Obama is reportedly considering adopting a nuclear \"no first use\" doctrine to bolster his legacy as champion of a world without nuclear weapons.\"Proponents of these ideas claim they would reduce tensions and the risk of escalation or inadvertent nuclear conflict.Unfortunately, the opposite is true: Despite their superficial appeal, these measures would be deeply destabilizing,\" Shearer said in an article on the \"War on the Rocks\" website.A no-first use policy is unlikely to persuade U.S. nuclear rivals to change their plans, could \"needlessly tie a president's hands,\" and creates a perverse incentive for adversaries to strike first, said Shearer, who served as national security adviser to Australian prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott.\"Russia is modernizing its strategic forces and openly threatens to use nuclear weapons in eastern Europe. It is easy to dismiss this as bluster, but President Putin has already used force to change Europe's borders ? the first time this has occurred since 1945. Western military planners worry that conventional NATO forces in Eastern Europe may be insufficient to deter a Russian move on the Baltics, even though they are being augmented,\" Shearer said.\"In Asia, North Korea's unpredictable dictator Kim Jong-un already has nuclear weapons, and is developing land and submarine-delivered missiles to launch warheads at targets in Asia, the Pacific, and as far as the American mainland. Last week, a missile landed within 200 miles of Japan,\" he said.In addition, China is also modernizing, diversifying, and building up its nuclear forces, while deploying new conventional weapons to constrain U.S. forces' ability to project power and defend allies in the Western Pacific, the expert said.The no-first use policy would also lead to allies questioning the U.S. security commitment to them at a time when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is \"bashing longstanding allies and telling Japan and the Republic of Korea to get their own nuclear weapons,\" he said.\"Allies don't vote, but they shouldn't be ignored. By providing extended deterrence, U.S. nuclear weapons not only defend the United States but also reassure allies and help to convince them not to obtain their own. Rising tensions and instability in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East mean that American allies already face significant threats,\" Shearer said.\"Giving them cause to doubt the reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent will only feed their insecurity and make them less dependable partners. It will also stoke strategic competition in Asia and the Middle East, spur proliferation, and increase the risk that nuclear weapons are used some day ? the precise opposite of what the White House intends. Japan has already expressed concern,\" he said.Rather than changing the nuclear doctrine, Obama should focus on boosting conventional deterrence, reassuring American allies and tightening the screws on North Korea, Shearer said.U.S. president Barack Obama (yonhap)\"U.S. presidents occasionally get the nuclear wobbles, generally for good motives. Ronald Reagan detested nuclear weapons and famously almost bargained them away with Mikhail Gorbachev. But he didn't. Instead his legacy was the peaceful defeat and collapse of Soviet expansionism and the end of the Cold War,\" he said.Obama has sought to make the initiative for building a nuclear-free world a key legacy of his presidency, launching the Nuclear Security Summit of world leaders aimed at reducing the stockpile of fissile material and keeping it out of the hands of terrorists.The fourth and last Nuclear Security Summit was held in Washington earlier this year. (Yonhap)","237":"North Korea carried out its June test of the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile from an east coast airport and is expected to use the facility for future tests, a U.S. website monitoring the North said.The website 38 North said that the June 22 test took place at the Kalma International Airport in the city of Wonsan. The assessment was reached based on comparison of ground photos published by North Korean media and commercial satellite imagery, it said.North Korea did not disclose where the test was carried out.(Yonhap)\"This airport is in the final stages of being converted from the Wonsan Airbase to modern civilian facility, but also includes a recently constructed firing position for heavy missile transporter-erector-launchers,\" 38 North said. \"It is likely that North Korea will continue to use both this location and its companion facility on the Hodo Peninsula for live-fire artillery, rocket and missile tests, with the Kalma location being used primarily for highly publicized events and the Hodo facility for more routine testing and training,\" it said.The June test clearly demonstrated the North is making significant progress in its intercontinental ballistic missile development as the Musudan missile reached space and then re-entered Earth's atmosphere before falling into targeted waters.Re-entry technology has been considered one of the hardest obstacles the communist nation must overcome before developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile, along with warhead miniaturization technology.The launch was the North's sixth attempt to test the missile since April 15. All but the sixth launch failed, with the missiles exploding in midair or on a mobile launcher, or crashing seconds after launch.

The health care worker, who is currently being treated in isolation, had been working at Korea University Ansan Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit for newborns.Following her diagnosis, a total of 51 babies and 57 health care workers are being tested for TB, the KCDC said. An official enters Samsung Medical Center, where a nurse was diagnosed with TB last month. YonhapSince last month, two other nurses in Seoul -- one at Ewha Womans University Medical Center and the other at Samsung Medical Center -- were diagnosed with TB also through regular health check-ups provided by their employers. Notably, both of the health care workers also worked at pediatric units at the medical institutions, one at the intensive care unit for infants and the other unit for children patients with blood cancers.At Ewha, 166 babies and 60 health care workers were tested following the nurse\u2019s diagnosis last month. Among them, two infants and five health care workers were diagnosed with latent TB -- a condition in which the TB bacteria is in the body but inactive and causing no symptoms. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB at some point in their lives.According to the World Health Organization, over 95 percent of TB cases and deaths worldwide are in developing countries. South Korea currently has the highest incidence rate of TB among nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, partly due to the lack of epidemiological research of the disease since the 1950-53 Korean War. It is known that roughly one third of the entire Korean population currently has latent TB. \u201cWhen we introduced our national health insurance system in 1989, many state-run health centers were replaced by private clinics that focused on treatments rather than epidemiological research on infectious diseases, including TB,\u201d Health Minister Chung Chin-youb said earlier this year.As of 2014, Korea\u2019s TB incidence rate marked 86 per 100,000 persons, about 28 times higher than one in the U.S. -- where the incidence rate of the disease is the lowest among the OECD -- which is 3.1 per 100,000 persons. Last year alone, 32,181 Koreans were newly diagnosed with the disease, while 2,305 died of the disease in 2014.\u201cMany latent TB patients aren\u2019t aware of the disease because they are asymptomatic,\u201d said a doctor at a general hospital who wanted to remain anonymous. \u201cSome TB and latent TB patients find out about their disease while applying for a visa in a foreign country, as many countries require foreign visitors to submit their TB test results along with their visa application.\u201dSouth Korea has recently seen a number of TB cases at facilities with a large number of people, such as schools and postpartum centers. Last year, TB cases were reported in 974 schools, 332 military bases and 91 day care centers and postpartum care facilities -- where many newborns are placed in a same room together. To tackle the issue, the Health Ministry announced in March that all Koreans would be required to be tested for latent TB at least twice in their lifetime, at age 15 and 40, starting next year. TB treatments became free for all patients in Korea last month. Earlier this month, the ministry also said employees who work at facilities with a large number of people, such as health care workers and school teachers, are going to be required to be tested for TB regularly. Yet it\u2019s the workers\u2019 employers, not the government, that are responsible for financing the cost of the tests, which costs about 50,000 won ($44.91) per person. The Health Ministry did not allocate any budget for the specific project. Rep. Kim Seung-hee of the ruling Saenuri Party told Health Minister Chung last week that the ministry should finance the cost of the TB test for health care professionals, day care workers and school teachers. Minister Chung said the government will try to allocate a budget for the tests next year.It was during former President Lee Myung-bak\u2018s administration (2008-2013) that South Korea increased its budget for TB prevention dramatically, from 14.9 billion won in 2010 to 44.5 billion won in 2011. The former president in fact suffered from TB back in 1965, when he was a university student, and was treated for a severe lung condition in 2009, according to his autobiography. This year\u2019s budget for TB prevention is 3.92 billion won.By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","239":"Amid the prolonged heat wave affecting the Korean Peninsula, the number of South Koreans rushed to hospital emergency rooms nationwide for heat-related illnesses has topped 1,000 this summer, with half of them reported over the recent two weeks, a government agency said Sunday.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a total of 1,016 people have visited hospitals for heatstroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, heat fainting and other heat-related illnesses since May 23, when it began HRI monitoring.

In June, three more North Korean restaurant employees working in China escaped to Seoul.The diplomats called in to Pyongyang in early July were reported to be in charge of supervising those areas where the defections took place, said Radio Free Asia (RFA), citing anonymous sources. They have been going through a rigorous review of their loyalty to the regime, it added. Overseas restaurants are an increasingly important source of dollars for the North at a time when international sanctions have cut off Pyongyang from the outside world aimed to dry up the money needed to pursue missile and nuclear development. North Korean overseas workers are usually proven loyalists of the regime and are more affluent compared to ordinary citizens. They are allowed to work abroad and send back hard currency for the country.

The firms have adopted the flextime system under which their employees flexibly decide their work schedules to spend more time with their families.The Park administration has been carrying out a campaign for work-family balance through a multifaceted program that encourages public and private firms to introduce the flextime system or other methods, such as a work-at-home scheme. The program also includes an after-school program for elementary school children to support working mothers.The government currently offers 400,000 won ($345) per employee to each company that has the flextime system in place. The president has said she would consider increasing the amount to 600,000 won.In June, Park visited Air Korea Ltd., an affiliate of South Korea's Hanjin Group conglomerate that boasts a comprehensive program, including the flextime system.

(Yonhap)\u201cWhile pursuing creative public diplomacy by developing our own assets of charm and content, we will work more with the people, the most important agent and multistakeholder partner in modern public diplomacy.\u201d Under the act, the government plans to set up a public diplomacy committee early next year, led by the foreign minister and with participants at the vice-ministerial level from other agencies, as well as private experts. They will review a basic framework to be crafted every five years and annual action plans, intra-agency coordination and other related issues. The text also calls for the government to provide necessary financial and administrative support for municipalities exchange activities, and paves the way for the launch of a comprehensive database on public diplomacy. This year 14.2 billion won ($12.8 million) has been set aside for the activities, more than a twofold jump from 2013 when the country included public diplomacy as a standalone budget item for the first time. But it remains a fraction of that of other countries such as the U.S. and the U.K., each with some 1 trillion won, Japan with around 500 billion won and Russia with nearly 89 billion won. Marking the law\u2019s effectuation, the symposium brought together dozens of senior policymakers, lawmakers, scholars and journalists at the National Assembly to explore its significance and ways for a better implementation. Yun Duk-min, chancellor of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, offered an upbeat outlook despite Korea\u2019s relatively late foray. \u201cNow is the time for Korea\u2019s public diplomacy to take a leap forward, given the significance of soft power in determining a middle power\u2019s diplomatic sway, and the potentials the country has built over the past 20-plus years through the Korean Wave, official development assistance and other knowledge and people-to-people exchange programs,\u201d he said at the forum. \u201cBut for that we will have to look into every non-hard power dimension in details and in depth from both theoretical and practical aspects, whether it be culture, business or media, so that they can go together in a consistent manner.\u201d Lee Sook-jong, president of the private East Asia Institute, said the law could expedite a long-term planning, closer intra-agency coordination and effective implementation of limited resources. Yet she raised concerns about possible tension between the stakeholders. With other agencies having a greater say such as in budget allocation and event planning than the Foreign Ministry, heated competition may result in fragmentation or eroding the ministry\u2019s coordinating authorities as the main enforcer. \u201cI believe the overseas diplomatic missions are key,\u201d said Lee, who also teaches at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s about reaching out to the international public as broad and much as possible.

There are about 130,000 on the list with roughly half of them having already passed away.The poll showed that 77 percent of those surveyed raised the need to spur exchanges with North Korea over the separated family issue.Out of these, nearly 52 percent said that the state-arranged family reunions should be prioritized, but other face-to-face meetings should be pushed forward, including meetings with North Korean relatives in a third country through a broker.The ministry then said that the average age of South Korean separated family members reached 80 for the first time this year.Under relevant laws, the government is required to conduct a survey of separated families every five years to check whether they are alive and want to meet their relatives in the North.The two Koreas remain technically at war as the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.The two sides have held 20 rounds of such reunions so far, but there are still thousands waiting their turn.In October 2015, the two Koreas held their first family reunions since February 2014. But they have failed to hold such events so far this year amid North Korea's continued nuclear and missile provocations.

This latest action by the DPRK will serve no purpose other than heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the peace and security of the wider region,\" it said.It also urged Pyongyang to refrain from any further action increasing tensions and engage in a meaningful dialogue.North Korea fired two Rodong intermediate-range ballistic missiles early Wednesday. One of them exploded right after launch, but the other flew some 1,000 kilometers and fell in waters off Japan in the country's exclusive economic zone.Such launches represent a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban the North from any activity using ballistic missile technology over concern that it can be used to develop long-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also issued a statement denouncing the launches.\"I strongly condemn North Korea's ballistic missile test today, which caused one missile to land in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Whenever I enter the the DMZ area on a reconnaissance mission, I'm determined to retaliate against the enemy if they provoke us.\"The noncommissioned officer said he will remain a career soldier and hopes to continue his reconnaissance duty in the Army. \"Even if the job is tough and dangerous, I will do my best to defeat the enemy.\"Staff Sergeant Lee Hyung-min, also a member of the team attacked by the land mine last year, took part in the latest drill.In the maneuver, the masked South Korean soldiers simulated a situation of coming across enemy troops who had infiltrated the southern side of the DMZ by crossing the military demarcation line.Once the point man spots the enemy soldiers, he signals the rest of the team visually to let them know about the presence of the enemy nearby. Under orders from team leader Jeong, some soldiers move to surround the infiltrators under covering fire from their colleagues and effectively deal with the threat.\"I ask my subordinates to undertake every reconnaissance mission with the mindset they are the team leader so they can better react to the enemy's unexpected and unpredictable attacks,\" Jeong said. \"Helped by such constant drills I am confident that our team can react quickly and effectively even if we are subject to the same kind of land mine attack we sustained a year ago.\"In the land mine explosion that took place in the DMZ on Aug. 4 last year, one soldier lost both legs and the other lost one. The ensuing inter-Korean military showdown caused Seoul to restart its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts against the North, which were only discontinued after the communist country expressed \"regret\" over the mine explosion on Aug. 25. Meanwhile, to better monitor blind spots around the clock, the Korean Army has set up an unmanned warning system along the MDL. It is a complementary measure to strengthen the monitoring job carried out by soldiers in the general outposts (GOPs) and guard pots (GPs), Maj. Kim Tae-woong, a spokesman for the ROK Army 1st Corp, said. \"We have also removed all the scrub and weeds along the MDL and beefed up the reconnaissance operations since August last year. We believe these efforts will help contain further military provocations near the border,\" Kim said.In the past year, however, North Korea has stepped up its military provocations against the South by test-firing missiles and conducting its fourth nuclear test in early January. In its latest provocations, it fired off two mid-range Rodong ballistic missiles, with one presumed to have landed in waters controlled by Japan, the South Korean military said.","250":"A total of 41 countries have submitted action plans to the United Nations that aim to penalize North Korea for conducting its fourth nuclear and long-range missile tests earlier this year, a U.S.-based media report said Wednesday.According to Voice of America, these countries submitted their plans this week after the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 2270 in March. The latest sanctions slapped on the reclusive country by the international body are viewed as being the most stringent yet, as they aim to curb Pyongyang's ability to earn hard currency. These funds are suspected of bankrolling North's nuclear ambitions.U.N. members have been asked to submit their own implementation reports within 90 days of the resolution's adoption, but countries need not abide by the deadline.The number of countries joining the action plan are 23 more than the 18 countries that outlined what they planned to do following the North's third nuclear test in 2013.According to the VOA, the number of pages making up the implementation report is much more than in 2013. The media outlet said on average each country submitted action plans over four pages long, with Cyprus having the largest document, a 21-page report, followed by the United States with 19 pages, Japan with 13 pages and South Korea with 10 pages. In 2013, the average was around 3.8 pages per country.The VOA said the main change this year compared with three years ago is that more African countries and other countries friendly to North Korea have submitted implementation reports.For instance, the African country of Uganda made it clear in the report that it would cut down military cooperation with North Korea.Unlike in 2013, Laos, Vietnam and Mongolia, which have been maintaining amicable relations with North Korea, have all submitted implementation reports, according to the media report.A South Korean foreign ministry official said in a telephone conversation with the VOA that international concerns have mounted over the technical advance in North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and this has heightened international awareness, as well as the importance of the Resolution 2270.Meanwhile, the South Korean government submitted its implementation report in June, which includes the government's explanations on measures taken against the North, such as restrictions on shipping and transportation, along with other financial and economic restrictions.

As in the year before, the paper also carried a map of the country\u2019s air defense identification zone, outcropping skies over the Dokdo Islets as its territorial airspace and denoting the Dokdo Islets by its Japanese name \u201cTakeshima.\u201dThe map included in Japan\u2019s defense white paper. (Yonhap)\u201cThe (Korean) government strongly condemns the Japanese government including its sovereignty claims to Dokdo Islets, which is clearly our own territory by historical, geological and international standards, in the 2016 defense white paper on Aug. 2,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said in a statement, urging Tokyo to cease what the ministry called its \u201cfutile claims\u201d to the Dokdo Islets.The ministry called in Kohei Maruyama, a minister of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to lodge a formal protest.Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry also summoned a defense attache at the Japanese Embassy earlier in the day, and delivered a statement of complaint.\u201cKorea\u2019s Ministry of National Defense will firmly react against any attempts to infringe upon the sovereignty of the Dokdo Islets, and will seamlessly protect our rights to the Dokdo Islets,\u201d the statement said.Located in waters between Korea and Japan, the Dokdo Islets lie in ample fishing grounds and is believed to hold rich reserves of natural gas and other resources. Prior to annexation of Korea, Japan illegally incorporated the islets in 1905 as part of its territory. Seoul regained control of it in 1945 upon its independence but Tokyo has repeatedly attempted to claim the islets and the surrounding waters -- which they call the \u201cSea of Japan\u201d -- as its own.Japan\u2019s renewed claims on the Dokdo Islets dealt another blow to the tumultuous relations between the two countries, which has been marked by recent territorial and historical disputes stemming back to Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonialization of Korea.The icy relations had shown signs of thawing, with the two governments agreeing in December on a landmark deal on Japan\u2019s enslavement of Korean women during World War II, euphemistically called \u201ccomfort women.\u201d The agreement centered on launching a 1 billion yen ($9.77 million) foundation on helping the victims of sexual slavery.But the agreement was marred by the conservative Shinzo Abe administration\u2019s remarks denying the coerced nature of the comfort women and insistence that Seoul remove a statue of a girl -- a symbol of the comfort women -- that stands adjacent to the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.In addition to the Dokdo Islets claims, Tokyo\u2019s annual document addressed North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats, saying that there is a possibility that the communist nation has achieved miniaturization of the nuclear warheads. Making the warheads small enough to fit ballistic missiles is considered a critical step in achieving nuclear strike capacity.Pyongyang has been upping efforts in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs on orders from its leader Kim Jong-un.It also raised concern over the territorial dispute in the South China Sea and accompanying military tension between China and the U.S. The document accused China of attempting to carry out its unilateral claims through force.By Yoon Min-sik\u00a0\u00a0(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","254":"The South Korean Army said Thursday it conducted a combined arms drill by mobilizing tanks and armored vehicles in a bid to beef up its combat readiness against North Korea's threats.The drill was aimed at boosting the military's combat preparedness in the winter time, involving the infantry, artillery, armor and combat engineer units, the Army said.The combined exercise was conducted at a shooting range in Yangpyeong, outside of Seoul, with about 40 K-1 tanks, K-21 armored fighting vehicles and other mobile assets being mobilized.At the range surrounded by mountains, K-1 tanks made a simulated attack on enemy targets by firing off its main guns while getting covering fire from self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, it said.The combat engineers provided smoke screen, and eliminated land mines and other barricades to facilitate the advance.

There, the party claimed that the THAAD system will pave the way for a \"permanent\" separation of the two Koreas, adding that the government must scrap the plan and seek parliamentary approval.Chung, meanwhile, added that other parties must remember the late President Roh Moo-hyun's efforts to send South Korean troops to Iraq, despite strong opposition from liberals, showed the critical nature of Seoul\u2019s alliance with Washington.

They denounced it as \u201cfake compensation.\u201dThe company said the final plan was based on three rounds of talks with victims and their families, following its corporate values of \u201crespect, fairness, transparency and accuracy.\u201dReckitt Benckiser head Ataur Rashid Safdar (Yonhap)Under the final plan, Oxy will compensate up to 350 million won ($315,787) to victims categorized upon government investigation as group one and two. Up to 1 billion won will be compensated for infant and child victims\u2019 deaths due to the severity of suffering and the difficulty in calculating potential earning losses.However, victims argued that the final plan does not cover all victims as it leaves out those classified under categories three and four, whose suffering were deemed less directly connected to Oxy\u2019s products.As of May, there were 309 victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants classified in categories three and four, compared to 221 victims in categories one and two. The scale goes from one to four, with the lowest being highly certain that health damage resulted from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants. \u201cWhile more than half of victims are named in categories three and four, Oxy has not mentioned a single word about compensating them,\u201d said Choi Ye-yong, the head of the Asian Citizen\u2019s Center for Environment and Health during a press conference in Seoul on Monday.He also added that the amount suggested by Oxy is far less than what should be paid when punitive damage is applied to the company. Current Korean laws do not recognize punitive damages.Whether to pass the legislation on punitive damage has been a hot topic between rival parties as well as at the Supreme Court recently. The relevant bill is pending due to worries that it may cause double punishment for defendants.The purpose of punitive damage is to punish the defendant for misconduct and deter the defendant and others from similar misbehavior in the future. Companies may face compensation payment from two to three times more than the amount of victims\u2019 damages.Civic groups have been arguing that the recent cases of Audi Volkswagen Korea\u2019s emission-rigging and Oxy Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s distribution of toxic humidifier disinfectant should be punished based on punitive damages.Meanwhile, Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- released its first newspaper advertisement in local dailies on Monday.Along with an apology, the advertisement by RB Korea detailed the application process for victims to receive compensation from the company.Starting August, each victim\u2019s case will be analyzed by Oxy to finalize the compensation amount, considering the previous and future medical costs, potential earnings lost and emotional distress.This kind of official apology by the company comes 4 years and 11 months after the first death from the use of Oxy\u2019s toxic humidifier disinfectant.

One of the disinfectants had contained OIT. The meeting was attended by officials from the KACA and representatives from local air purifier manufacturers including Samsung Electronics, LG, Cuckoo and Winia.\u00a0YonhapTo improve product safety and dispel public anxiety, companies said they agreed to revise the current regulation standard and ask the Environment Ministry to strengthen control of chemicals used in filters.Currently, electronic home appliances are supervised by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy under the Electrical Appliances Safety Control Act. Air filters are not included in the list for ministry supervision because they are considered electronic components.According to the regulation, the ministry-designated association is in charge of the authentication process for air purifiers. Since 1998, the KACA has been giving Clean Air authentication marks to air purifiers based on the functions of the product, such as deodorization efficiency, noise level and dust collection efficiency. A total of 113 air purifier models from 24 local brands including Samsung Electronics, LG, Coway, Chungho Nice, Winia, Cukcoo, have acquired this Clean Air mark.The revised authentication standard will include stricter safety test for filters. Five chemicals -- OIT, CMIT, PHMG, PGH and MCIT -- will be banned from use in manufacturing filters. These are the chemicals that were found to have been used in toxic humidifier disinfectants, which caused at least 200 deaths since 2011.Substances designated as harmful in other countries and uncertified sterilizing chemicals will also be banned from being used in filters.If a company breaches the above regulations or cannot provide documents to prove product safety, they will not be able to acquire the Clean Air mark.\u201cIt is true that the current authentication standard did not fully consider the safety of air purifiers,\u201d one of the attendees at the meeting was quoted as saying.\u201cAlthough it may seem like 20-20 hindsight, we believe the related ministries and customers will welcome our idea of a stricter authentication process, which is aimed at putting customer safety first before anything\u201d the official added.According to a local news report, 3M sold over 720,000 filters to local companies from 2014 to May this year. This accounts for 80 percent of the total number of filters sold in the market.Amid moves to recall the products out of concern, the corresponding companies last week announced that they would offer free filter replacements to customers.

It then said while a South Korean high school student will spend about 170 hours on Korean, English and math, a student in the North will have a curriculum requiring 215 hours of Korean, 243 hours of English and 368 hours of math. In the areas of science, a South Korean high school student will need to spend 204 hours, with a North Korean counterpart needing the allocated 799 hours in such fields as physics, chemistry and biology.The report, however, said that while the North did seem to have longer hours, South Korean data reflected the bare minimum and not the actual time students put into a subject. It added that information coming out of the North cannot be verified independently so its accuracy may be in doubt.\"South Korean students had more leeway to choose subjects, which causes wide shifts,\" the report claimed.The report also did not take into account extracurricular studies, which are widespread in South Korea.\u00a0 Despite the difference, the report outlined that the North seems to be moving toward adopting \"international standards,\" which would make it more akin to South Korea's educational structure.In 2012, the North changed its 11-year school system to a 12-year one, and separated middle school and high school. It has taken steps to allow students the opportunity to pick some classes, and intensified its English language programs.On the other hand, the latest assessment made clear that Pyongyang still views education as a tool to sustain the regime.\"The education materials always include propaganda aimed at bolstering the regime, and this kind of indoctrination in children's formative years influence how many think later on,\" Kim said.The researcher said these differences in education are something Seoul needs to consider down the line as it seeks unification.

Still, it said many defectors had a hard time finding full-time jobs.Even among professionals who were doctors, teachers and researchers in the North, only 51.3 percent were employed in the South, with just 16.8 percent being hired in their original areas of expertise. Government data showed 685 North Koreans who held professional jobs had arrived in the South so far.Among young people, those that gave up their studies have decreased over the years, but the high school dropout rate for defectors stood at 7.5 percent, which is much higher than it is for their South Korean counterparts.\"Despite many gains over the years, the latest data on defectors showed the need for more systematic and active support to help those that have escaped the North to become productive members of South Korean society,\" NABO said.

Among the announced measures are antiviolence education programs for residents of remote areas. Teachers will visit remote towns and villages to talk about gender equality and the importance of preventing and combating sexual violence. The government is also coming up with new ankle bracelets -- a homing device that ex-convicts of sexual violence are often required to wear in South Korea -- that will analyze each individual\u2019s body temperature and pulse, on top of the location of offenders. This is to help the authorities better monitor offenders and prevent possible future crimes. To tackle child abuse, the government plans to encourage Koreans to attend classes on parenting. As of this year, about 80 percent of all child abusers were the victims\u2019 parents.In August, authorities will investigate and visit homes of all school children -- including those who attend high school -- who have not been in school for a long period of time or have taken a semester off. In the case of Won-young\u2019s death, it was his school teacher who was worried about his absence in school and made a police report, bringing the issue into the public spotlight. Government data, such as National Health Insurance records, will be used to track down children\u2019s whereabouts.The prime minister also released plans to combat violence in schools and protect young victims, including psychiatric support for students and the installation of surveillance cameras at all elementary, middle and high schools nationwide.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","266":"North Korea publicly executed six officials in charge of supervision of its workers overseas in May following the defection of 13 workers at a North Korean-run restaurant in China a month earlier, a local Pyongyang watcher said Friday. \"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered six officials, including intelligence officials, to be executed publicly on May 5 due to their lack of control over overseas (North Korean) workers,\" Choi Seong-yong, chairman of the Abductees' Family Union, claimed, citing people familiar with the matter.Eighty public officials and 100 people who have their family members working overseas were forced to watch the execution, he said.

But such precautions still seem inadequate in keeping her germ-free, especially when strangers near her start to cough without covering their mouth. \u201cI saw a lady who clearly had a contagious cold, coughing, sneezing and wiping her nose with her hand in the subway. I immediately stood up and moved to a different part of the subway,\u201d Kim said, expressing frustration at ignorance about etiquette in public places.In the face of the worst seasonal flu sweeping the nation, Kim\u2019s complaint seems to be shared by an increasing number of South Koreans. A student is seen wearing a face mask during class at an elementary school in Masan, South Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. (yonhap)Doctors, too, stress that simple etiquette can be most effective in preventing the spread of the contagious seasonal flu virus. The failure to properly educate students and follow preventive steps may have been behind the worst flu outbreak in decades, they said. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a record high number of young patients were diagnosed with flu last week -- 152 flu cases per 1,000 students aged 7-18. The government began monitoring the flu in 1997.Dr. Kim Yang-hyun of the Anam Hospital of Korea University Medical Center said flu etiquette is relatively less known or followed by Koreans, compared to people in other countries. \u201cDid you know that you should sneeze into your elbow, not your hand?\u201d he asked. \u201cAlso, not many in South Korea can decide for themselves whether or not they should go to work or school when they sneeze and cough,\u201d he added. Last year, South Korea had a major outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome that caused 38 deaths. The state-run KCDC, in response, came up with antiviral treatment guidelines that include educating children and adults to sneeze into their elbows.But such information is still not well known among the public or taught at schools, experts highlighted.Sneezing into one\u2019s elbow can prevent some 3,000 infectious droplets from being sprayed onto hands, which could spread germs by holding or passing frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and tables. \u201cKoreans tend to campaign or follow health care steps only when a serious disease outbreaks,\u201d a medical resident at Seoul National University Hospital told the Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. \u201cSimple but fundamental preventive steps can keep colds away. All we need to do is to follow simple manners on a daily basis, which takes on a whole new meaning when their intent is to protect your health and the health of those around you,\u201d he added.In other developed countries like the US, health authorities have been campaigning since 2009 to teach elementary school students to properly cover their mouths when they cough through the distribution of flyers and posters about health care, under the slogan \u201cCough = Elbow.\u201dSouth Korean health authorities said Tuesday that they had suggested schools start their winter vacation earlier than scheduled and immediately stop students from attending school. Doctors said the disease, the influenza A virus subtype H3N2, is unlikely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia, if patients receive timely treatment.\u201cAlthough the flu virus this time is accompanied by symptoms such as headaches and muscle pain -- rare for other types of seasonal flu -- the disease can be cured when the patients visit the doctor immediately and take antiviral drugs like Tamiflu,\u201d said Dr. Kim Gyu-yeon of The Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Health System.Getting a vaccination, either a flu shot or a nasal-spray type vaccination, is another simple method to reduce chances of catching cold. \u201cThose who study or work in confined spaces are particularly susceptible to the highly contagious illness, since people with the flu can spread it to others up to about 2 meters away, mainly by droplets made when they cough, sneeze or talk,\u201d said Kim.While vaccines show efficacy after two weeks, it is still not too late to get a vaccination now, as the cold weather is to continue until February next year, he added.

The think tank worried that the North's additional provocation would result in more diplomatic pressure from the incoming Donald Trump administration, heighten tensions and prompt yet another nuclear crisis in the region. The INSS said that the Kim Jong-un regime may launch a peace offensive by pursuing talks with the US and South Korea in the second half but if the attempt does not pan out, it could resort again to provocative measures.The North conducted its fifth nuclear test in September, drawing strong condemnation from the international community. In November, the UN Security Council adopted a new set of sanctions aimed at making it hard for Pyongyang to obtain hard currency that can be exploited to pursue its nuclear ambitions. The US and South Korea have said that there will be no talks with the North until it shows meaningful action toward denuclearization.

More than 160 similar reports of a gas odor were received within two hours on the same day, mainly from Jung-dong in Haeundae-gu and Yongho-dong and Daeyeon-dong in Nam-gu.Although Busan City immediately dispatched employees to check the gas pipes of the city, it found no gas leak.

The pyroprocessing, or pyrochemical processing, is a high-temperature method that makes materials change chemically and recycle reactor waste into fuel. A Seoul-Washington nuclear energy deal signed last year allows South Korea to experiment with the pyroprocessing technology.The government had sought to build a nuclear repository for both high and low-level radioactive waste in the western coastal county of Buan, but the plan was scrapped in 2004 after weeks of violent protests in the city that left hundreds of people injured.Then, it decided to construct an isolated storage unit only for high-level waste like spent nuclear fuel, which would be separate from one for low and intermediate-level radioactive waste like gloves, goggles and other equipment exposed to radiation at nuclear power plants.Gyeongju, some 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul, volunteered to host a facility for less radioactive waste, which was completed in June 2014.The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said the government will strictly comply with the decision-making process to carry out a geological survey for 12 years before selecting the right site for the nuclear waste disposal program in around 2028.It will take another 24 years to finally complete the construction of the facility on the selected site due to mandatory experimental and repository equipment required to check the safety of the long-term management of long-lived radioactive waste.\"We will conduct thorough feasibility studies including a geological survey before deciding on the site,\" the ministry said in a release. \"We will go through objective and transparent procedures to check the opinions of the locals.\"Currently, such high-level radioactive waste is stored in temporary underground tanks in several nuclear power stations, which are expected to reach their saturation point from 2019 one by one.South Korea had around 16,300 bundles of spent fuel rods generated from light water reactors and 408,000 bundles from heavy water reactors as of end-2015.The country operates 23 nuclear reactors which generate about 30 percent of its total electricity supply.

The 300 overseas Korean collegians from North America, Europe, Asia, Central America and South America will participate in an eight-day program that will begin Wednesday. The state-run foundation has organized the program to help the youths find their Korean identity.\"The students have more interest in and love for their mother country than any others. They, among other things, can fluently speak both their local languages and Korean, and thus can play excellent roles in correctly promoting their mother country only if they receive proper education,\" said Park who has led a decades-long movement especially to rectify the distortions of the history by Japan at a civic level. History distortions by Japan, including its territorial claim over South Korea's easternmost Dokdo Islets, have been spread around the world, and in particular they are spread in foreign textbooks or on foreign websites not only in English but other languages such as German, Indian, Spanish and French, he said.\"But it's a reality correction efforts are confined to the English-spoken region,\" Park said.

Won Yoo-chul claimed, adding the country should also develop its own nuclear weapons capability to deal with Pyongyang's ever-growing threat.Since 2006, the northern country has tested four nuclear devices and argued it can put these on top of missiles able to target all of South Korea, Japan and some U.S. bases in the Pacific.Trump has been claiming the U.S. should continue defending other countries as long as they pay for the cost of the troop presence, arguing that it makes no sense to pay to defend rich nations. South Korea currently pays about half the costs, about $900 million a year, to help finance its U.S. troop presence.Yoo added North Korea may conduct its fifth nuclear test around the end of this month, adding South Korea should also come up with serious countermeasures if the reclusive country makes such a move.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The five-term lawmaker has been an advocate of Seoul acquiring nuclear weapons as a means to defend itself.In line with the move, Yoo said he will kick off the so-called nuclear forum to conduct studies on detailed action plans to better cope with North Korea's provocations and help establish peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.Political pundits, however, said it is uncertain if Yoo's claim will earn support from other party members, as it contradicts the government's stance on non-proliferation.

The report found that 52.4 percent of all migrant wives were employed as of 2012, while 84.1 percent of them hoped to continue working or seek employment in the future.However, most migrant wives who were in work faced a lack of job security, the study showed. While 35 percent of them worked as temporary workers, 18.9 percent of them were involved in day labor -- meaning they were hired and paid one day at a time, with no promise to return. Also, 9.5 percent of them were doing unpaid work for their Korean in-laws, such as family farms or businesses.\u00a0 A group wedding of South Korean men and their foreign-born brides, which was jointly financed by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Woori Bank, held earlier in Seoul this month. (Yonhap)The study showed that 65 percent of all working migrant wives\u2019 monthly salaries ranged from 500,000 won ($439) to 1.5 million won ($1,318). At the same time, 17. 4 percent of them were making 500,000 won or less a month. Only 2.7 percent of them were making 2.5 million won a month or more. The average monthly salary of a university-educated, first-year Korean office worker is 1.9 million won, as of this year.\u00a0 In terms of occupation type, the largest proportion of them, 30 percent, were engaged in simple labor such as cleaning or delivery. Another 23.9 percent were working in the service sector, followed by 13.6 percent who were factory workers. Only 163 out of 119,922 working migrant wives were working in managerial positions, accounting for 0.1 percent. The report also discovered that migrant wives who have a child aged 9 or younger, those who are married to low-earning Korean husbands, those who have experienced discrimination while living in Korea, and those who are from mainland China \u2013 excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2013 were more likely to seek employment here. Migrant wives with children aged 9 or younger were 92 percent more likely to be working than those who did not have children but were in the same age group, the report showed. Also, women from Hong Kong and Taiwan were 76 percent less likely to be working than those from mainland China.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time,\u00a0wives from Japan, the U.S., Russia,\u00a0Canada, Uzbekistan and Cambodia\u00a0also had a significantly lower\u00a0likelihood of participating in the workfoce in Korea than women from mainland China. Chinese-born, ethnic Korean women from mainland China accounted for the largest proportion of migrant wives by taking up 31.5 percent. One of the reasons behind their high employment rate has to do with their proficiency in the Korean language, researchers noted.Researchers suggested the government come up with special job-training programs for migrant wives in low-earning households, especially those with young children. \u201cLanguage proficiency and education degrees would lead to higher-paying jobs,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThere should be ways for the mothers to get the education they want -- while getting a degree may take a long time, it\u2019s better for their career prospects in the long-run -- while being able to raise their children with adequate support.\u201dAs of 2012, those from China, including Chinese-born ethnic Koreans, accounted for 55.7 percent of all migrant wives in Korea, followed by those from Vietnam (22.1 percent) and the Philippines (6.3 percent).

Hwang Young-cheul on Tuesday, speaking for the dissenters.\u201cConsidering the urgency of the situation, we shall hold a meeting at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow (Wednesday) and finalize our stance (on leaving the party).\u201dWhen asked about the detailed format of their Saenuri Party exit, Rep. Hwang said they would \u201csplit into a new political party,\u201d instead of going independent.He also denied rumors on the internal divide within the nonmainstreamers\u2019 group.\u201cShould there be division of any sort among ourselves, we will face harsh criticism from the people and fail to achieve our goal,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, a group of pro-Park lawmakers had decided earlier in the morning to disband their recently formed entity in a gesture to put an end to factional feuds.They, however, continued to disapprove of the non-Parks\u2019 notion of having Rep. Yoo as interim chief.\u201cFrom now on, we shall never constitute any group that speaks for the pro-Parks,\u201d said Rep. Jeong Kab-yoon, a fifth-term Park loyalist, pledging to serve for a conservative victory in next year\u2019s presidential race.\u201c(All of us) should be ashamed of playing a blame game regarding the Choi Soon-sil scandal. It is hard to understand that some lawmakers should seek to shun responsibility.\u201d\u201cIf there is anyone who can navigate through this crisis to bring unity to the (conservative) party, an outsider is also welcome,\u201d Rep. Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader-elect from the pro-Park group, said in a press conference Tuesday. Rep. Yoo Seong-min answers reporters\u2019 questions on his way to the parliamentary interpellation Tuesday afternoon. (Yonhap)Rep. Yoo hinted at the high possibility of leaving the party, citing he was willing to \u201csacrifice\u201d if it helped the sincere reform of the conservative party. Another non-Park leading figure, former Saenuri head Rep. Kim Moo-sung, previously announced he would establish a new party.For the dissenters, the key task is to gather at least 20 lawmakers to form a negotiation body at the National Assembly and become the No. 3 party at the parliament by garnering at least 40 members to outnumber the 38 seats the People\u2019s Party holds.\u00a0 \u201cPossible resignation of the lawmakers should not just be viewed as acts of individuals, but rather a separation process of the conservative party,\u201d Rep. Na Kyung-won said in a radio interview.

The Tokyo District Court found the 28-year-old suspect, identified only by his surname Chon, guilty of breaking into the premises of the Yasukuni Shrine on Nov. 23 and setting up the bomb in the public restroom, Kyodo News said. Photo shows a South Korean man, identified only by his surname Chon, who has been indicted over the suspected bombing last year of a public restroom at a Tokyo war shrine. (Yonhap)He was arrested in December shortly after voluntarily returning to Tokyo by plane.Chon's legal representative has been demanding a suspended sentence, while admitting to the wrongdoings. Prosecutors had originally sought a five-year sentence. The defendant's 55-year-old mother said they will appeal the ruling.Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.Many Koreans still harbor deep resentment against Japan over its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. (Yonhap)","300":"The North Korean passenger ferry Mangyongbong will be put on a China-North Korea-Russia tour route next month, a Washington-based broadcaster reported Tuesday. \"Tourism officials (from the three nations) agreed on the trilateral project at their meeting in (the North Korean special economic zone of) Rason last Tuesday,\" Radio Free Asia quoted a tourism bureau official from the far eastern Chinese city of Hunchun, Jilin Province, as saying.The officials also agreed to make use of the North Korean ship as a tour boat that will cover a section of the route from the North Korean port of Rajin to Russia's Vladivostok, the radio said.Undated photo shows the North Korean ferry Mangyongbong anchored at the Japanese port of Niigata. The ship is likely to be used as a cruise ship on a China-North Korea-Russia tourist route next month. (Yonhap)The tour will also link Rason to Hunchun in China, although what ship will be employed for this leg of the route has not been mentioned.After the meeting, the attendants inspected the interior facilities of the ship moored at the Rajin port. The 3,500-ton vessel will undergo a safety check, and start its pilot operation on Sunday, the broadcaster said. According to the accord, the Mangyongbong will leave Rajin at 11:00 p.m. (Pyongyang Time), and arrive at Vladivostok the following morning after eight hours of sailing. Then the boat will depart at 4:00 p.m. and arrive at Rajin before dawn the following day, according to the media. The ship is scheduled to provide the service 10 times a month, it added. Commissioned in 1971, the 102-meters-long, 14-meters-wide North Korean boat had originally sailed between the North's Wonsan and Japan's Niigata mainly to transport pro-Pyongyang Koreans residing in Japan who had wanted to live permanently in the communist country. The vessel reportedly has been remodeled of late to be used as a tour boat.Japan has banned the ship's entry into its port since 2006 as sanctions on Pyongyang's first nuclear test and missile launches that year.

Yoo Seong-min, a leading member of Saenuri's dissenter group that has been at odds with President Park Geun-hye and her loyalists. On Monday, the dissenters group proposed that Yoo should head its emergency committee and warned they would leave if the proposal is not accepted by those loyal to the president.Saenuri has been suffering from the factional feud amid Park's alleged corruption scandal, which led to her impeachment earlier this month.While the dissenters group says Saenuri should seek a full reshuffle to regain the public's trust, Park loyalists have countered that now is not the time to engage in infighting and said those that disagree should leave.\"If our main goal was just to leave, we can always find excuses. But that's not our goal,\" Yoo said. Yoo served as the party's floor leader in 2015 and was forced to step down over disagreements with the president.Political pundits said the dissenters group will also need time to win the support of more lawmakers, as South Korean parties must secure at least 20 lawmakers to establish a negotiation body at the National Assembly.Yoo said he is also open to staying in the party and reforming it.\"But if Park loyalists, including new floor leader Chung Woo-taik, only chase their political interests and remain reluctant to reform, there will be no hope,\" Yoo said.Chung, a Park loyalist, was elected the new whip through an in-house vote, which came as a disappointment for impeachment supporters. His predecessor Chung Jin-suk, who is viewed as neutral, stepped down in response to the passage of the impeachment.The new whip, meanwhile, said Yoo need to come up with detailed plans on how he will resolve the factional feud.\"I do not intend to side only with the pro-Park faction,\" Chung said, adding he will seek to persuade both factions on the designation of the emergency committee chief.Chung has been claiming that the factional feud could actually escalate once Yoo heads the committee. The election for the party interim leadership seat will be held within three days, the whip said.Observers said initially some 20 lawmakers may leave the party, with the figure growing to as high as around 40, which would be enough to form a parliamentary negotiation body.If successful, the dissenters will be able to become the National Assembly's No. 3 party, outpacing 38 seats held by the People's Party.The size would be bigger if former Saenuri head Kim Moo-sung, who also hinted on leaving the party, join forces with Yoo, pundits added.\"If Kim leaves alone, he would only take some 10 lawmakers,\" a pro-Park lawmaker predicted.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","302":"A group of United States congressmen reaffirmed Monday that their support for a strong South Korea-US alliance will remain unwavering in any circumstance, a pledge which came after President Park Geun-hye's impeachment earlier in the month. Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn met with six US House of Representatives members, including Peter Anderson (Republic-Texas), who are visiting South Korea.In the meeting, Hwang highlighted that the government's policy lines, including those on the alliance, remain unchanged and state affairs are managed in a stable manner despite the recent impeachment, according to a press release from his office.He is currently acting as the president since President Park Geun-hye was impeached on Dec. 9 for allegedly colluding with her close friend to force companies to donate a huge amount of funds.Now Park is awaiting the Constitutional Court's final decision on whether to accept the parliamentary impeachment. \"Under any circumstances or changes, the US Congress' support toward the South Korea-U.S. alliance will be the same,\" the press release quoted the US congressmen as having said during the meeting with Hwang. The close relations between the allies should continue to develop, the US lawmakers also said, underlining that their latest visit is intended to cement the US Congress' solid support for the alliance.The congressmen also promised the US' relentless backing of the South Korean government's policy toward North Korea and its nuclear program as Hwang appealed for the US Congress' interest in implementing sanctions on the communist country, according to the press release. The two sides also delved into their bilateral free trade agreement, assessing that it has been a key economic pillar of Washington's relations with the East Asian region. The six-men delegation also included William Keating (Democrat-Massachusetts), Patrick Meehan (R-Pennsylvania), David CiCilline (D-Rhode island), Paul Cook (R-California) and Dan Newhouse (R-Washington).

The park was temporarily closed since Saturday after it found two dead storks on consecutive days.Seoul City said it has also obtained 2,700 doses of antiviral drugs and 12,000 items of protective clothing in case the outbreak spreads to people. Currently there have been no reports of infections through people or livestock so far.\u201cWe are putting together every effort to secure citizens\u2019 health with high-level quarantine measures,\u201d said Seoul Mayor Park Won-Soon in a statement.\u201cWhile chicken, duck and eggs that are sold in the market in Seoul are safe to eat, I hope groundless worries about eating poultry do not hurt the poultry farms in the country,\u201d Park added.Authorities said that it will strengthen quarantine measures at some 17 wintering sites for migratory birds located in Seoul, such as the Han River and Jungnang Stream, by sterilizing the area every day.An off-limits sign is held Monday at an ecological park by the Han River, following a series of bird flu cases detected in zoos and outdoor places around Seoul. (Yonhap)The city government has already closed down four ecological parks in the capital and halted a migratory bird observation programs after the H5N6 bird flu virus was first reported in southern rural areas on Nov. 16.Some 55 city officials will be dispatched to monitor households which raise birds as pets.The current outbreak is already worse than that in 2014, when 13.96 million fowls were put down over six months. A record number of 10 million chickens, ducks and quails have been culled throughout the nation so far, with an additional 3.78 million on the waiting list.The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs expects the financial toll to reach 423.3 billion ($358.7 million) as the outbreak was uncontained in most of the disease-hit areas such as the Chungcheong provinces.The infections were found to be the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of the flu, a new type of the virus first detected in the country.By Kim Da-sol(ddd@heraldcorp.com)","304":"More than 35 percent of thirtysomethings in South Korea remained unmarried last year amid a widespread late marriage trend in the country, census data showed Monday.According to the 2015 census by Statistics Korea, out of 42.7 million people aged 15 or over, 13.4 million, or 31.3 percent, were single, up from 30.6 percent five years earlier.At the same time, the percentage of unmarried people in their 30s reached 36.3 percent in 2015, up 7.1 percentage points from 2010 data. The figure has been on a sharp rise since 2000, when it was about 13 percent.By gender, 28.1 percent of women in their 30s remained unmarried, with single males accounting for 44.2 percent of the age group.The data showed that women with higher educational background get married less than others, as 18.9 percent of university graduates and 23.4 percent of those who have master's degrees were single, while only 9.4 percent of females aged over 30 were unmarried.

The amount of petroleum hydrocarbons near Camp Kim close to Namyeong Station averaged 20.4 mg\/L and reached up to 768.7, some 587 times higher than the government standard of 1.5 mg\/L.Noksapyeong Station (left), Camp Kim (right) (Yonhap)The readings mean the level of toxic pollutants in the groundwater has decreased by 70 percent near Noksapyeong Station and by 92 percent near Camp Kim since 2015, but it is still a lot higher than sewage laws allow.As the relocation of key military bases in central Seoul to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, is set to be completed by the end of 2017, the Seoul government has been clearing the contaminated soil since 2001. However, the source and full extent of the toxic contamination of the soil and ground water near the Yongsan base is not known, with the US military refusing to disclose the details of its cleanup efforts.The Environment Ministry carried out on-site inspections on soil and ground water in the Yongsan base on three occasions from May to August, but has declined to release its results, citing \u201cpossible diplomatic clashes.\u201dThe refusal is in line with the Status of Forces Agreement signed between Korea and the US, which defines areas of legal responsibility for the US soldiers here. According to the SOFA, the US military is only responsible for the contamination within its camp. A high court ordered on Dec. 14 that the Environment Ministry disclose its inspection result about the level of pollution inside the US military base, ruling in favor of environmental groups. The environmental civic groups have criticized the US military for dodging responsibility for the pollution and the Korean government for overlooking its citizens\u2019 health and safety. The activists have urged the Korean government to figure out the source of the pollutants and effectively remove it to prevent the spread of the contamination. As the Korean government is covering the costs of tackling the pollution, they also have demanded the US Army pay a share of the cleanup costs.Since 1988, there have been 14 reported cases of environmental contamination involving US bases here.In 2000, the US 8th Army Command was found to have dumped untreated toxic waste into the Han River, a major source of drinking water for Seoul residents. In 2001 and 2006, oil was spilled from the US Army Garrison and Camp Kim in Yongsan, contaminating underground water systems in the neighborhood.

The Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the legitimacy of the motion and has up to 180 days to deliver a ruling. Park was accused of allowing Choi to exert undue influence on state affairs.The president then said the motion itself violated clear rules that ban \"guilt by association\" as well as \"presumption of innocence,\" strongly suggesting a media bias and that lawmakers carried out the impeachment without actually checking evidence.Park, moreover, claimed she was not aware of any wrongdoings committed by those around her, and referred to Choi as a \"kitchen cabinet\" member or informal adviser, which is commonplace in countries like the United States.\"Any attempt to delay the Constitutional Court's proceedings will not be tolerated,\" Rep. Choo Mi-ae, head of the Democratic Party said. Choo said the impeachment was not based on guilt by association, but considered Park an accomplice to her confidante Choi.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Sunday that it temporarily closed the Seoul Grand Park in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul, over the weekend after it found two dead storks over consecutive days.Authorities said it did not find anything significant from the autopsy results, while the examinations have been sent to the National Institute of Environmental Research for further investigation on the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of the flu.Reopening the zoo will be discussed following the result of the investigation, the authorities added.Seoul City said that Seoul Children\u2019s Grand Park in Gwangjin-gu will also be temporarily closed after the government raised its watch level from \u201calert\u201d to \u201cserious\u201d last week, the highest vigilance level in the country\u2018s disease control system.As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said that health authorities are entitled to close any chicken farm or cote if necessary.On Sunday, a chicken farm in Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, was confirmed for H5N6 bird flu virus after it reported the deaths of chickens and unusual movements of ducks. Quarantine authorities ordered the immediate ban on the movement of stockbreeders at poultry farms in the vicinity, as an examination into three other farms in the city is ongoing.

By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","308":"North Korea's ability to engage in special operational warfare has improved over the years, as the reclusive regime builds up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, a local state-run think tank said Sunday.According to the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses (KIDA) that took detailed testimonies from North Korean defectors who served in senior field or command positions in Pyongyang's military, the regime has made a concerted move to not only build up the country's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) but also its conventional forces.\"Every intelligence points toward a buildup of conventional arms,\" said an official source, who declined to be identified. The source, in particular, said South Korea's military is of the opinion that the North has set up more special forces units, upgraded the equipment used by such troops and beefed up their training. North Korean flag(123rf)KIDA and the military said as a case in point, the North actually created a battalion-size unit specially tasked with attacking South Korea's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae and assassinating key figures in government.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un actually visited this battalion on Nov. 4 and the troops assigned to the unit actually took part in a mock attack on Cheong Wa Dae early last week.Even before such developments, the North has placed considerable emphasis on special forces, and is reported to employ large numbers of troops for special missions in the event of war breaking out on the Korean Peninsula.The source then said Seoul is currently in the process of reassessing the North's infantry, artillery, special warfare, naval and aerial capabilities, with the final classified report to be submitted to the defense ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff in the first half of 2017.Such analysis can paint a clearer picture of North Korea's military might that has been greatly boosted by it nuclear weapons program.This year alone the North tested two nuclear devices and fired off dozens of ballistic missiles, including those launched from a submarine, which can pose considerable challenges for South Korea and its main ally the United States.Others said that while it has become very hard to carry out signal intelligence, with Pyongyang using underground cables to send commands to all key forces, Seoul still has the ability to carry out human intelligence gathering from various sources that includes defectors.Since 2000, there have been 294 North Korean soldiers who have defected to the South, with many being senior officers and noncommissioned officers who have a generally good grasp of developments taking place within the military. Of the total who have reached the South, 20-30 have held command posts with their insight being instrumental in the compiling of the latest assessment.They said this is the kind of intelligence that Japan wants to acquire through the recently inked General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA).\"There is a chance that Tokyo may use GSOMIA to get a copy of the military reassessment report that Seoul is working on,\" insiders said. (Yonhap)","309":"TOKYO (AP) -- It's been five years since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, whose demise was observed at monuments and on city center plazas across the nation Saturday. Here's a look at five ways the country that has now been ruled by three generations of Kim -- starting with grandfather Kim Il-sung -- has changed since the ascension of its 30-something \"respected marshal.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE MAN HIMSELFKim Jong-un is in some ways a lot more like his charismatic and gregarious, albeit brutal and megalomaniacal, grandfather than Kim Jong Il. He has gone out of his way to milk that resemblance, right down to adopting his trademark haircut from a seemingly bygone era. While his father almost never spoke in public, Kim Jong-un has done so on any number of occasions, including a four-hour address at his ruling party's congress in May. On the flip side, one of his most important moves to consolidate power -- the execution of his powerful uncle and the purges that ensued -- demonstrated both his personal independence and his willingness to employ the same kind of oppressive tools that were the hallmarks of both his father and grandfather. And, despite a short-lived friendship with former NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman, he has yet to travel abroad or meet a foreign head of state.\u00a0\u00a0People bow to portraits of the late leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, at the Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea, Saturday, to mark the fifth anniversary of Kim Jong-il's death. (AP Photo\/Kim Kwang Hyon)NUKES, MISSILES AND ROCKETSTurning North Korea into a nuclear power wasn't Kim Jong-un's idea -- it almost certainly originated with Kim Il-sung himself -- but it's defined his first five years. Of the five nuclear tests North Korea has conducted, three have been under his watch and two, including its most powerful to date and its first of what Pyongyang claims was an H-bomb, were this year. Kim Jong-un's North Korea has been sprinting to the finish line of a viable nuclear arsenal and the advanced missile technology needed to attack South Korea, Japan and the 50,000 US troops it hosts, the key US military outpost of Guam and the US mainland itself. At the same time, and some argue for largely the same reasons, the North under Kim has also joined the space race, putting satellites into orbit and aiming to reach the moon within the next decade. \u00a0SHIFTING PRIORITIESNorth Korea's main motto under Kim Jong Il was \"Military First.\" Under Kim Jong-un, the focus is now on building more and better nukes and bolstering the national economy, in large part through developing science and technology. To suit his goals, Kim has shifted more power to the ruling party and to his Cabinet and put the nation on collective overtime with repeated \"loyalty campaigns.'' It remains to be seen how sustainable his two-pronged nukes-and-butter policy will be in the face of international sanctions and internal, systemic weaknesses. So far, it has been at least workable. The North is already a de-facto nuclear state and its economy, though fragile and no doubt underperforming, is showing small but persistent growth.\u00a0FOSTERING MARKETS AND ENTREPRENUREURSProbably more out of pragmatic necessity than anything else, Kim Jong-un has allowed capitalist-style markets and entrepreneurialism to expand, invigorating the domestic economy and creating new revenue streams for the government, which profits by either taking a cut or by directly supporting such enterprises. Changes in farming policy that let individuals personally benefit from bigger harvests have boosted agricultural output. The relatively affluent capital of Pyongyang -- home to the North's most fortunate -- has seen a significant increase in everything from taxis to coffee shops and streets stalls. But the rise of the \"cash masters,'' an empowered middle class more open to capitalist ideals, or just more determined to acquire material wealth, could prove to be a problem for Kim down the road.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0KEEPING THE MASSES ENTERTAINEDKim Jong-un has on several occasions vowed to make North Korea a \"more civilized'' nation. His signature development projects include an equestrian center and sprawling water park in Pyongyang and a luxury ski resort near the port city of Wonsan on the east coast. He has tried to give his regime something of a softer face through the all-female Moranbong Band, which sings its odes to him in a decidedly pop, and vaguely titillating, manner. Kim also generated a major national sensation by ordering a Disney-quality update to the \"Boy General'' anime series originally commissioned by his father. On another major front, Kim has made a big shift toward sports -- vowing North Korea will become a major international sports power -- presumably as a means of bolstering health and national pride and providing the masses with a relatively innocuous diversion from their daily lives.

General Assembly is scheduled to adopt a North Korean human rights resolution next week that calls for referring the situation to the International Criminal Court and expresses serious concerns about Pyongyang's labor exports, Seoul's foreign ministry said Friday.The resolution, which was adopted by a third committee under the assembly last month, will be adopted at a plenary General Assembly meeting slated for Monday (local time), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.\"The North Korean resolution is forecast to be passed at the plenary General Assembly meeting with consensus,\" the ministry said in a release.It would mark the 12th straight year for the General Assembly to adopt a North Korean human rights resolution. In particular, it is the third consecutive year for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution calling on the Security Council to refer the North's human rights situation to the ICC. This year's resolution blamed the North's \"leadership\" for human rights abuses, underlining the seriousness with which the international community views the situation.It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which have become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concerns that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.(Yonhap)","311":"South Korea and Japan on Friday directly exchanged classified information on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs for the first time in line with their intelligence-sharing pact which came into force last month, the defense ministry said. Defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told reporters that the exchange was made during a meeting between the two countries'senior defense officials held in Seoul in conjunction with a three-way security dialogue which also includes the United States. \"Under the recently-signed General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), Seoul and Tokyo have shared intelligence on Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs for the first time since the pact's signing last month,\" he said. Under the pact, the two countries are obliged to share information regarding North Korea's nuclear programs, missile development and other military activities, the ministry said. It is the first military pact signed between the two nations since Korea gained independence from Japan's colonial rule from 1910-45. During the Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT) later in the day, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan discussed measures to effectively counter North Korea's military threat.\u00a0 As part of the efforts, they agreed to continue with their missile warning exercises held in June and November to improve their combined capabilities to detect and trace North Korean missiles.This year alone, Pyongyang conducted two nuclear tests and more than 20 missile launches.(Yonhap)","312":"South Korea and China have wrapped up their \"Visit Korea Year 2016\" campaign in Beijing in a ceremony overshadowed by a diplomatic feud over Seoul's missile shield plan. South Korean Minister of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Cho Yoon-sun and China National Tourism Administration Chairman Li Jinzao presided over the celebration of the yearlong national drive to promote Korean tourism among the Chinese on Thursday.The event came amid growing diplomatic tension over Seoul's decision to set up a U.S. missile defense system called THAAD next year to better counter increasing North Korean threats. Beijing fiercely opposes the plan, which it said would harm its strategic interests in the region. In an apparent retaliation, China has restricted cultural exchanges in the tourism and entertainment sectors. In his opening remark, Li said the two countries, with geographical proximity and cultural similarity, should cooperate in the tourism sector for mutual benefits.\u00a0 Li also openly expressed his concern that the on-going feud over THAAD could have negative impacts on bilateral relations down the road.Saying that the bilateral relations have recently faced new challenges and are heading toward an uncertain era, he stressed that the two governments should seek solutions together to secure conditions for solid cooperation in tourism. His remarks apparently suggested that unless disagreements between Seoul and Beijing are resolved, cooperation in the tourism sector won't get any easier next year.Echoing the sentiment, Culture Minister Cho relayed the concerns shared by the Korean tourism industry and sought Li's active cooperation in keeping private exchanges intact from political conflicts.In her celebratory address, Cho emphasized the importance of keeping private exchanges flourishing regardless of political situations. \"In 1992, when the two countries established diplomatic ties, there were only 100,000 mutual visits.

It was followed by the splinter People's Party with 12 percent, down 1 percentage point.Gallup Korea did not release the approval rating of the president as she was impeached last week. The poll was conducted on 1,004 people with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. (Yonhap)","315":"North Korea's state radio station resumed broadcasting mysterious numbers Friday after a four-day break that could be some kind of coded message to its agents operating in South Korea.Radio Pyongyang, the Korea's state-run radio station, started broadcasting messages at 1:15 a.m., calling out a series of pages and numbers before repeating them one more time.The radio announcer \"gave review work in metal engineering to No. 27 expedition agents.\" The content was different from what has been transmitted this year.Since June 24, 18 of such encrypted numbers broadcasts have been discovered, with the latest one broadcast Sunday.Broadcasts of mysterious numbers are considered a kind of book cipher that was often used by North Korea to give missions to spies operating in South Korea during the Cold War era. Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence officials believe this form of sending orders to be totally outdated.Many have said the broadcast may be some sort of psychological strategy aimed at sparking internal confusion within South Korea.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000, when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.Tensions are already running high on the divided peninsula after North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9 and the unsuccessful launching of two Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missiles last month, with some observers forecasting another kind of missile provocation in the coming days. (Yonhap)","316":"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A possible South Korean presidential contender said Thursday his country should reconsider plans to deploy an advanced U.S. missile defense system to cope with North Korean threats, a move Washington is likely to see as disruptive.\u00a0Liberal opposition politician Moon Jae-in said the security benefits of having Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, would be curtailed by worsened relations with neighbors China and Russia. He downplayed concerns that South Korea backtracking on the plans would cause tension with the United States, which he said was the \"most important country'' for South Korea in face of nuclear-armed, rival North.\u00a0\"The issue of whether or not to deploy THAAD should be pushed to the next government,'' Moon said in a news conference.\"Reconsidering THAAD would have to be preceded with diplomatic efforts, including diplomatic efforts with the United States. I don't think that the reconsidering of THAAD would harm the South Korea-U.S. alliance,'' he said.\u00a0Recent opinion polls have shown Moon as a presidential favorite amid the popular anger over conservative President Park Geun-hye, whose powers were suspended after lawmakers last week voted to impeach her over an explosive corruption scandal.\u00a0South Korea's Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether Park should permanently step down. If Park is formally removed from office, the country would hold a presidential election within 60 days.Moon, who conceded the 2012 presidential race to Park, said he expected the court to rule on Park's impeachment sometime between late January and early March, setting up a presidential election around April or May.\u00a0\"It would be a huge honor for me if I can take part in the next presidential election,'' Moon said.\u00a0South Korean military officials in September picked a private golf course in the country's southeast as the site for THAAD, which was slated to be deployed by the end of next year. They originally chose a nearby artillery base in the rural farming town of Seongju as the site for the system, but changed locations following fierce protests from locals who expressed concern over potential health hazards they believe the system's powerful radar might cause.The plan to deploy THAAD in South Korea has angered not only North Korea but also China, which suspects that the system would allow U.S. radar to better track its missiles. Russia also opposes the deployment.Moon also argued that Seoul should put dialogue over sanctions in persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. He rated the Park government's hard-line stance against North Korea as a ``complete failure'' because it ``didn't function in any way'' to prevent the North from expanding its nuclear weapons and missile programs.\u00a0\"It has been confirmed that pressure and sanctions alone would not be enough to influence North Korea to give up on its nuclear weapons,'' said Moon, calling for a \"two-tack approach'' of sanctions and talk.\u00a0\"We need strong punitive measures against North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launch tests, but the purpose of such strong pressure and sanctions should be bringing North Korea to the negotiation table for denuclearization.''\u00a0Moon, a former human rights lawyer and aide to late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, also pledged to fight income inequality and push business reforms to curb excesses of ``chaebol,'' or family-owned conglomerates that dominate the country's economy, to create a level playing field for smaller companies.\u00a0The opposition Democratic Party's primaries could shape into a showdown between Moon and Lee Jae-myung, the outspoken mayor of Seongnam city whose popularity rose rapidly in recent months amid rage over the Park scandal.\u00a0The conservatives appear to be pinning their hopes on outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon after Park's scandal complicated politics for her Saenuri Party. In a visit to South Korea in May, Ban told reporters that he would \"think hard about what to do as a citizen'' after he returns home on Jan. 1, which was seen by the local media as a clear hint on a presidential bid.","317":"Representatives of foreign residents in Seoul on Wednesday shared ideas on how to make the city a better place to live. Celebrating the first year since the launch of the Seoul foreign residents\u2019 council, a total of 38 representatives from 23 countries and different walks of life gathered for a general assembly at the Seoul City Hall.\u201cWe represent some 460,000 foreigners residing in Seoul,\u201d said Taki Yukari, a Japanese office worker who settled in Seoul five years ago.\u201cAs a chair of the counsel, I feel (a) good amount of pressure to deliver ideas (to Seoul City) that can spark changes in Seoul. I\u2019m also glad that we\u2019re starting to see some changes for the multicultural population here,\u201d said Yukari, commencing the meeting.Members of the representative council for Seoul\u2019s foreign residents participate in a meeting at Seoul City hall on Wednesday. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)Launched in December 2015, the representative counsel for Seoul\u2019s foreign residents kicked off as an advisory body under Seoul Metropolitan Government\u2019s Women and Family Policy Affairs division, with the aim of directly hearing from foreign residents and about the difficulties they face. Latest data from Seoul City shows that foreigners from 117 different countries have paid 15.7 billion won ($13 million) in taxes to Seoul so far this year, up 19 percent from the corresponding period in 2012. Since its first meeting in July, 14 suggestions made by the representatives were adopted into policies at Seoul City.One of the policies was to publish and distribute disaster prevention guideline booklets in 11 different languages for the convenience of foreigners. \u201cWe were impressed by the depth and variety of suggestions they bring up during meetings,\u201d Eom Gyu-sook, head of the Women and Family Policy Affairs division told The Korea Herald.\u201cAs Seoul City\u2019s work ethic states \u2018governance through communication,\u2019 we will continue to make improvements through ongoing communication with experts, foreign residents, travelers and more,\u201d she said.On Wednesday, Karolina Zasadzka, who moved to Seoul from Poland three years ago, raised a point regarding Seoul\u2019s public transportation.Zasadzka said that Seoul\u2019s bike roads are not only small in numbers but authorities have also failed to properly control the speed limit of users and manage bike parking, compared to other companies.\u201cIn Poland, citizens who use public transportation can enjoy privileges such as discounts in transportation fares, parking fees or even free museum passes. Seoul should adopt more user-friendly advantages to develop a bike riding culture for the environment,\u201d she said.Zasadzka said that Seoul could tap on a K-pop celebrity to become an ambassador to promote Seoul\u2019s bike roads and bike rental services, raising user awareness. Seoul City welcomed the suggestion.\u201cWe like the idea of promoting Seoul\u2019s bike riding system, since it could be significant in helping citizens avoid traffic congestion as well as to save the Earth,\u201d said an official from the Public Transportation Service division at Seoul City.To become eligible to work for the counsel, members need to receive recommendations from 10 foreigners residing in Seoul and go through examination by a selection committee at Seoul City.Twice a year, all of the members gather to suggest ideas on issues largely divided into three sections: human rights and culture, improvements in the living environment and the strengthening of residents\u2019 abilities.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","318":"South Korean ruling party leaders said Thursday they will resign en masse next week amid a growing factional feud.All the members of the Supreme Council, its top decision-making body, will join party chairman Lee Jung-hyun when he quits next Wednesday as earlier promised, they said.

The findings raised concerns that confidential information may have been compromised as the affected server is connected with the information systems of the Army, Navy and the Air Force. But the ministry said information saved on the server was not stolen.The Ministry of National Defense said a total of 3,200 computers, including 700 linked with the intranet, were contaminated with malware in the latest cyber attack, which occurred on Aug. 4. It said some military documents were hacked while refusing to provide details. The computer used by Defense Minister Han Min-koo was also affected, the official said.On Tuesday, the ministry said the IP addresses linked to the attack were traced to a location in China that has been used by North Korean hackers.\"As one of the military's two integration servers was jointly linked to the internet and the intranet, it allowed the hackers to gain access to the intranet,\" a ministry official said. It is one of two servers the military operates. The other server involves information for the defense ministry, the Defense Security Command and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA).\"We are still in the process of determining what data were leaked. We found the hackers infiltrated the intranet using the main server but information in the server remains intact,\" the official said. The cyber command separated the affected server from the whole network to avoid the spread of viruses in October, two months after the initial hacking attempt was made in August. It marked the first time that the data of South Korea's cyber command has been compromised. South Korea set up the command in January 2010 as part of its efforts to counter external hacking attempts on the country's military.North Korea -- which has thousands of cyberwarfare personnel -- has a track record of waging cyberattacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.Earlier this year, Seoul accused North Korea of stealing information from about 10 South Korean officials by hacking into their smartphones.Two months ago, Rep. Kim Jin-pyo, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party, claimed that the cyber command was hacked in September. He told Yonhap that the attack targeted the \"vaccine routing server\" installed at the cyber command.Kim, who is a member of the parliament's national defense committee, said that a malicious code was identified and it appears to have taken advantage of the vulnerability of the routing server.The server is tasked with security on computers that the military has for internet-connection purposes. Around 20,000 military computers are known to have been connected to the server.Kim said in October that chances are \"very low\" that the hacking led to a leak of confidential information, given that the military's intranet is not connected to the server.The defense ministry later announced it has identified the intrusion of the malicious code into the system.

Seoul introduced its voluntary reduction target during a UN climate conference in Paris last December. \u201cThe action plans were formulated in a way that helps to shift the reduction-focused responses to climate change to a fresh paradigm centering on the market and technology ... and strengthen the private sector\u2019s role and promote the acceptability of the policy,\u201d the intra-agency statement said.\u00a0(Yonhap)Under the plan, the government aims to slash 219 million metric tons, or nearly 70 percent of the total reduction goal, from eight areas such as power production, industry and buildings, setting the sectoral target at 25.7 percent below projected levels. The largest slice would come from electricity generation with 64.5 million metric tons, followed by industry with 56.4 million metric tons, buildings with 35.8 million metric tons and new energy sectors including electric vehicles and energy storage with 282 million metric tons. Seoul also looks to curb 96 million metric tons through international market mechanisms in line with the Paris climate agreement. It would devise a more detailed blueprint by 2020, saying the overseas reduction plan requires additional global discussions such as on carbon credit trading and funding sources. Yet mindful of the industry\u2019s unabated jitters over what it calls a side effect on the business environment, the government left room for a future revision, saying it would \u201cadjust and complement\u201d its plans according to the \u201cfast-changing economic conditions\u201d at home and abroad and global climate policy trends. To ensure a transparent implementation and inclusiveness, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office will take over control from the Environment Ministry to oversee the issue and carry out inspections every five years through a public-private partnership. As part of efforts to pare the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel, the government is seeking to boost incentives for renewable energy and cleaner power plant projects. It intends to raise the share of renewable sources in its portfolio to 7 percent from the existing 6 percent by 2020.\u00a0 The plan called a cap-and-trade system \u201ckey\u201d to meeting the 2030 goal, which it said would expedite industry innovation and environmentally friendly investment while helping to integrate into the future global carbon market. It pledged to expand funding in the development of 10 climate technologies including solar and fuel cells and conversion of waste gas, while doubling investment in clean energy research to 1.12 trillion won ($957 million) by 202. Korea is the world\u2019s seventh-largest polluter, with its carbon output in 2013 reaching 572 million metric tons, according to the International Energy Agency. The country\u2019s emissions marked the fastest growth since 1990 among the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

But he later admitted that the president received placenta injections. (Yonhap)","333":"The South Korean government said Monday it will revise errors detected in the state-authored history textbooks unveiled last week, after listening to public opinion on the controversial books that have ignited fierce debate over the country's history. The Ministry of Education said it will revise 13 factual errors found in the draft versions of the new textbooks for middle and high school students to be introduced next year, announcing the interim results of the opinion gathering which will last until late this month.Last week, the government revealed the pilot editions of the textbooks, about a year after it officially announced the plan to revise the current textbook publication system to address what it called predominantly left-leaning content.The government has been raising the need to forge a common understanding of history in a country where people are divided ideologically, as the two Koreas still remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce. The textbooks are currently published by eight private publishing companies, while primary schools have a single set of national history textbooks. Among a total of 984 opinions registered as of Friday, another 85 are currently under academic review to decide whether they will be reflected in the final version, according to the ministry. One of the most fiercely debated issues is the description of Aug. 15, 1948 -- three years after Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule -- as the day of the \"foundation of the Republic of Korea (ROK),\" or South Korea, instead of the \"establishment of the ROK government.\"Local historians claim that the country already existed in the form of a government-in-exile, which was set up in Shanghai in 1919 to win independence from Japanese colonial rule.The government said it will hold multiple symposiums on the issue and keep their eyes on the discussions before making a final decision. (Yonhap)","334":"South Korea has increased its defense budget for next year to better cope with growing threats from North Korea, the defense ministry said Monday.The government set the defense budget at 40.34 trillion won ($34 billion) for 2017, up 4.0 percent from 38.8 trillion won a year earlier, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement.Of the total, 28.14 trillion won will be spent on operating military forces and facilities, with 12.2 trillion won set aside to bolster combat capabilities, it said.The annual defense budget exceeded 40 trillion won for the first time ever and accounts for 10 percent of the country's overall budget worth 400.5 trillion won for next year, the ministry said.Tensions persist on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs.The communist state conducted two nuclear tests in January and September, and launched more than 20 missiles this year alone.

(Yonhap)","336":"South Korean President Park Geun-hye received no treatment from her medical staff on the day of a deadly ferry disaster in 2014, a former presidential nurse said Wednesday, amid persisting rumors she might have undergone plastic surgery.The Army nurse, identified as Capt. Cho, who has been in the US for training at an Army hospital in Texas, also said in a telephone interview that neither she nor other medical staff visited Park's residence on April 16, 2014, when the ferry disaster happened.Her remarks are in line with what another former presidential nurse, identified as retired Capt. Shin, said about what happened on that day. Shin said in a recent media interview that she performed her routine duties but didn't see the president that day.Asked whether Park usually received Botox wrinkle treatments or other cosmetic procedures, Cho said, \"Not that I know of.\" She side-stepped questions about whether Park has usually received various nutritional injections or used outside medical facilities, citing confidentiality about patients.Rumors have persisted that Park might have undergone plastic surgery or other medical procedures on the day of the ferry disaster, which detractors allege could have led to her failure to properly cope with the sinking of the ferry Sewol that left more than 300 passengers dead or missing.The rumors came to the fore recently in the wake of a separate corruption scandal surrounding allegations that a long-time confidante of Park exercised huge influence over her and state affairs, and amassed ill-gotten wealth. Park has offered to step down over the scandal. (Yonhap)","337":"The UN Security Council on Wednesday approved a fresh batch of sanctions following North Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test, seeking primarily to slash the state\u2019s coal exports to China by nearly 60 percent and prohibit trade of copper, nickel and other minerals. Resolution 2321 is designed to further stifle Pyongyang\u2019s financial and maritime networks, diplomatic activities and overseas labor exports, while levying a new embargo on sales of statues, helicopters, ships and other items. It also called for tighter inspections on North Korean cargo and expanded the list of entities and individuals subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. The North\u2019s underground detonation in September defied a previous resolution the council imposed only six months before in response to the North\u2019s fourth nuclear test and another long-range missile test-fire.\u00a0The UN Security Council. (AFP-Yonhap)Seoul and Washington kicked off negotiations with the goal of \u201cplugging loopholes\u201d in the existing sanctions, such as a clause allowing coal trade for \u201clivelihood purposes,\u201d which they argue Pyongyang had been taking advantage of. However, negotiations with the other four veto powers had dragged out, chiefly due to the resistance of China, the North\u2019s top trade partner and diplomatic backer. The latest resolution took 82 days -- the longest-ever -- until its introduction. Seoul welcomed the results, saying that the measures, if successful, could cut the cash-strapped Kim Jong-un regime\u2019s hard currency earnings by at least $800 million. \u201cThe latest resolution marks another milestone in imposing the most robust and comprehensive nonmilitary sanctions in UN history on North Korea for its habitual violations of the UN charter and UNSC resolutions,\u201d Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at a news conference. \u201cThe North must bear in mind the council\u2019s warnings. It might face not only deepened economic trouble and diplomatic isolation, but also a suspension of its rights and privileges as a UN member state, unless it makes a strategic decision to take the path toward denuclearization.\u201d Natural resources are the top source of foreign currency for North Korea. Statistics from Beijing\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics of China show that in 2015 the country sold 19.6 million tons of coal to China, amounting to more than $1 billion. Starting from Jan. 1, however, the North\u2019s annual coal exports will be capped at $400.9 million or 7.5 million metric tons, whichever is lower. The resolution also restricted this year\u2019s coal exports to $53.5 million or 1 million metric tons, whichever is lower. In October, the coal revenue reached $102 million, up about 22 percent from a month before and nearly 70 percent higher than a year ago, Voice of America reported Wednesday, citing Seoul\u2019s Korea International Trade Association that compiled official Chinese data. During the monthlong period, coal took the largest share of North Korea\u2019s total exports to China, at almost 45 percent, followed by clothes and seafood.The council also slapped a fresh ban on sales of four minerals -- copper, nickel, silver and zinc -- extending the existing roster that includes iron, iron ore, vanadium and gold. The four metals generate around $100 million in revenue every year, the Seoul diplomat said. The copper embargo is expected to deal a blow not only to Pyongyang, but also some Chinese mining companies. An affiliate with China\u2019s Wanxiang Group has reportedly invested more than 28 billion won ($23.8 million) in developing copper mines in the North Korean border town of Hyesan since it acquired exclusive mineral rights through a joint venture in 2007. \u201cThere have been fierce back-to-back negotiations. It was indeed important to adopt a resolution as soon as possible, and compromise could have been reached earlier, but we opted instead to pursue a more complete set of measures, although it took more time,\u201d a senior official at South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry told reporters on customary condition of anonymity.\u201cBeijing\u2019s agreement to the sanctions seems to reflect its thinking that it needs to take action given (the North\u2019s) behavior -- it conducted two nuclear tests and more missile liftoffs within one year -- which runs counter to China\u2019s self-perception or pursuit as a world power.\u201d\u00a0A customs office in Dandong, China, near its border with North Korea. (Yonhap)In another new step, the resolution will bar the North\u2019s sales of helicopters, ships and statues. The communist regime runs offices in charge of building sculptures, namely in Senegal, Angola, Namibia and other African nations, with one major contract being worth up to tens of millions of dollars, the official noted. On finance, the text instructed UN member states to shut down all remaining relevant offices and bank accounts in the North within 90 days, except for humanitarian relief or other inevitable purposes. They can no longer provide any public or private export credits, guarantees or trade insurances. It also calls for all members to reduce the workforce at the North\u2019s overseas diplomatic missions and limit the number of bank accounts to one per mission and diplomat each in an apparent bid to prevent diplomats\u2019 illicit activities abroad. Inspections will toughen on sea, air and land cargo, as well as personal baggage, coming in and out of the country. Though not mandatory, the resolution called member states\u2019 attention to the regime\u2019s dispatch of overseas workers, which it said is aimed at obtaining hard currency to bankroll its nuclear and missile programs. As for the asset freeze and travel ban, the council additionally blacklisted 10 entities and 11 individuals, including former North Korean ambassadors to Myanmar and Egypt, over their suspected involvement in the country\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The council also added the following to its list of luxury goods banned from transactions: rugs and tapestries worth more than $500 and porcelain and bone china tableware valued at more than $100.

Addressing the nation Tuesday over the corruption scandal involving her and her longtime friend, Park pledged to step down \"in line with the timeline and the procedures\" set by political parties.Opposition parties have dismissed her pledge as a political ploy to stall for time and thwart their impeachment push. They, in particular, said that her pledge ran counter to public calls for her to bow out \"immediately and unconditionally.\" Jung Youn-kuk, presidential spokesman, speaks during a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul, Nov. 20, 2016 (Yonhap)\"(Park) has said that whatever decision the National Assembly will make, she will follow it as long as it is based on an agreement between the ruling and opposition parties,\" Jung Youn-kuk, presidential spokesman, told reporters.Asked if the presidential office thinks Park's five-year term can be shortened through a constitutional revision, Jung said, \"Whether that may be a constitutional amendment or not, (Park) will follow the timeline and procedures the National Assembly will set.\"Park's single presidential term is due to end in February 2018.The spokesman also indicated that Park will soon hold a press conference to further explain her position on a series of allegations facing her.Earlier this month, the prosecution cited Park as an accomplice in a host of the alleged wrongdoings carried out by her friend Choi Soon-sil and former key aides. The charges include the abuse of authority, the leak of official secrets and coercion.Cheong Wa Dae has dismissed all the allegations against Park, saying she will establish her \"innocence\" through an independent counsel probe, which is expected to begin next month.

The disgraced leader expressed her willingness Tuesday to give up the presidency, due to end in February 2018, if the National Assembly secures a \u201cstable pathway\u201d for its handover.At the heart of the discussions are the time frame of Park\u2019s dismissal and the vote, as well as whether to let Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn take over reign or appoint someone else in that position. As a way out, the ruling Saenuri Party has floated afresh an amendment to the Constitution to be carried out in tandem with the ongoing impeachment campaign.\u00a0Leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, including Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, watch TV as President Park Geun-hye makes her third national address on the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. (Yonhap)Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said the amendment could result in reducing Park\u2019s term by seven to eight months while sating ever-growing demands to decentralize power away from the president. \u201cOnce complete, the constitutional amendment would make possible the president\u2019s orderly, early resignation,\u201d Chung told reporters after Park\u2019s news conference. \u201cWe have to wrap up the lackluster debate on the constitutional amendment and move to the next stage.\u201d He also reiterated calls for talks on the formation of a neutral Cabinet as a follow-up step to the impeachment vote. Some leading opposition politicians, including main opposition Democratic Party of Korea Chairwoman Rep. Choo Mi-ae, argue Hwang should not be made acting president and should also take responsibility for his failure to advise the president in the run-up to the Choi Soon-sil scandal. \u201cIf the impeachment motion is passed under the current circumstances, the prime minister will take over the job and then questions may arise as to whether his leadership would live up to the people\u2019s will,\u201d Chung said. \u201cTo minimize the administrative impasse, I will negotiate with the opposition on the issue of the creation of a neutral Cabinet.\u201d But the opposition camp has rebuffed the idea, calling it an attempt to divert attention ahead of a looming vote on the impeachment motion. Some Saenuri members, such as Reps. Na Kyung-won and Ha Tae-keung, also warned the party leadership against distracting the discussions. \u201cNow is not the time to talk about a constitutional amendment, but to concentrate on unseating the president,\u201d the party\u2019s former chair and leading presidential contender Moon Jae-in said in an interview with JTBC late Monday. \u201cWhether it be an impeachment or the president\u2019s resignation, an early presidential election is unavoidable, and what matters is when,\u201d he said ahead of Park\u2019s news conference Tuesday. Rep, Park Jie-won, interim chief and floor leader of the minor opposition People\u2019s Party, also urged Saenuri lawmakers to focus on the impeachment initiative, which he said is the \u201cright way to uphold the citizens\u2019 will.\u201d As part of efforts to prepare for uncertainties, the two opposition parties held a seminar Monday to explore ways to better steer a post-impeachment administration. Many participants have raised concerns about the lack of clear documents on the role of the acting president, including whether it includes personnel appointment power, which may lead to an administrative vacuum. \u201cThere are no specific rules on the authority and status of the acting president due to past imperfect lawmaking,\u201d co-host Democratic Party Rep. Min Byung-doo said during the event, raising the need to enact related legislation. Among the hotly debated topics was whether the acting president would be able to appoint the successors to two constitutional justices who are slated to finish their terms in January and March. Once the Assembly approves the impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court is required to deliberate on it within 180 days of the submission.\u00a0 Another co-host, People\u2019s Party Rep.

The Seoul-based Transitional Justice Working Group (TJWG) plans to publish its first report on the collective graves in April or May, insisting it has gotten a grasp of 12 places believed to have such mass graves through interviews with 277 North Korean defectors and satellite images since last September, Radio Free Asia (RFA) said. \"We have to find out down the road where the victims (of the North's human rights violations) have been interred, how many they are and how they were killed,\" TJWG leader Lee Young-whan said, adding that the group is also gathering evidence on mass graves that can be used in future judicial procedures. The group plans to expand the number of defectors to be interviewed to 500 per annum from next year, he said. North Korea is known to have operated makeshift crematoria exclusively for those who have died or have been executed at correctional centers and is believed to have buried their remains en masse in certain places. (Yonhap)","342":"The decadeslong alliance between South Korea and the United States will remain intact and get stronger even after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year, the US ambassador to South Korea said Tuesday.As Seoul and Washington have built up strong ties in the past 60-plus years, their bilateral alliance will remain firm and get stronger after the Trump administration's inaguration on Jan. 20, Mark Lippert said in a forum in Seoul.The alliance will remain intact based on the two countries' bilateral ties in security, economics and person-to-person relationship, the top envoy added.In this photo taken on Nov. 29, US Ambassador to South Korea Mark W. Lippert delivers a congratulatory speech at a forum on the incoming Trump's administration's policy toward East Asia and North Korea's nuclear program in Seoul. (Yonhap)But he remained cautious, saying it is \"too early to answer\" questions about the Trump government's policy toward East Asia, and North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs.He made the remarks during a congratulatory speech for the forum titled, \"The New US Administration's Policy toward East Asia & North Korean Nuclear Programs,\" organized by the Research Institute for National Security Affairs of Korea National Defense University.During the presidential race, Trump argued that the US should no longer be the \"policeman of the world,\" expressing deeply negative views toward US security commitments overseas and claiming it makes no sense for the US to help defend such wealthy allies as Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia in exchange for little. He has said allies should pay 100 percent of the cost of stationing American troops or the US should be prepared to end their protection. He even suggested allowing South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce US security burdens. Some 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Many international affairs experts have said the US troop presence is in line with US interests as the region has to face China's steady rise.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","343":"Opposition parties Monday put the final touches on the draft of the impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye, but they are still unclear when it will be put to a vote.It is a choice of between this Friday or next, but the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea emphasized prudence, as winning the overwhelming support of the parliament is more ideal than rushing to pass the motion.\u00a0 \u201cI understand that the people are eager to pass the motion as quickly as possible, but the key is how much we are prepared for it,\u201d said the party\u2019s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. \u201cIf we think we are prepared, we should go for Dec. 2. If not, we should choose Dec. 9.\u201dThe comments came after People\u2019s Party interim chief Park Jie-won said they have more than enough votes from the ruling Saenuri Party to ensure the motion\u2019s passage. Rep. Park said at least 60 Saenuri lawmakers would vote for the motion. To remove President Park from office -- she won the election on the Saenuri ticket -- the envisioned motion must clear a two-third threshold at the 300-seat Assembly and nine-member Constitutional Court. Opposition parties and independents combined control 172 lawmakers as of Monday, 28 votes shy of the required 200. On Friday, a group of 40 Saenuri lawmakers -- who are critical of Park and her loyalists who dominate the party leadership -- said they would join the campaign to unseat Park, but opposition parties are still not sure whether all of them will vote as they have said in a secret ballot. The Saenuri lawmakers who approve of the impeachment measure also said that while they would follow the timeline suggested by the opposition parties, they prefer a voting session on Dec. 9. The plenary session slated for Friday already has some key bills to pass, they said. Topping the agenda for Friday\u2019s session is next year\u2019s budget bill which by law must pass the parliament no later than the day. Observers said that some lawmakers may be reluctant to pass both the impeachment motion and the budget bill at the same time.\u00a0 The impeachment motion, if passed, will lead to the country\u2019s second presidential impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court. Opposition lawmakers are trying to include as many impeachable offenses as possible in the draft, in order to provide enough legal grounds for the court to approve of Park\u2019s removal.\u00a0 Floor leaders of the three opposition groups decided Monday to come up with a final draft by Tuesday. Constitutional law experts noted the parliamentary impeachment motion is the only point of reference for the top court to review the case, because the lawmakers cannot insert additional charges into the motion once it passes the legislative body. \u201cThe court cannot base their decision on something that is not described in the Assembly\u2019s impeachment motion,\u201d said Kim Jong-cheol, a constitutional law professor at Yonsei University. \u201cDescribing impeachable charges in detail is the Assembly\u2019s important obligation.\u201d But some worry that if they include too many charges in the motion, it might take longer for the court to deliberate. According to prosecutors, Park is suspected of abusing her power by helping her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil extort money from conglomerates and giving her access to classified government documents.

Opposition parties currently plan to put the impeachment motion up for vote in early December. Given that all opposition and independent lawmakers back the motion, its passage needs support from at least 28 Saenuri lawmakers to meet the minimum requirement of 200 votes out of the 300-seat National Assembly.Rep. Hwang Young-cheul, spokesman of the emergency council of Park opponents, said the estimate is based on a survey of lawmakers participating in the group. He added the number of supporters may be higher if other lawmakers are counted.In the wake of the scandal, the ruling party was overtaken this week by the People's Party to rank third in public approval for the first time, according to the pollster Realmeter. It recorded 16.7 percent, down 2.3 percentage points from a week earlier. Once the most popular political party with over 30 percent support, its rating has dropped for the eighth consecutive week since the scandal broke.

Thirty-two lawmakers from Saenuri have already expressed their support. But pundits do not rule out the possibility some opposition lawmakers may vote against it.Once the motion is passed, it will be adjudicated by the Constitutional Court, which experts estimate may take some three to four months.\u00a0The factional feud in Saenuri has been escalating over whether ruling party lawmakers should join the impeachment bid.Saenuri head Lee Jung-hyun warned Thursday that the party cannot become a \"betrayer\" of Park. He added that the impeachment will further increase uncertainty and risks for the country.Observers said Saenuri may be on the path to breakup, especially as its former head Kim Moo-sung declared his support for the impeachment on Wednesday.Later on Thursday, a group of 158 lawmakers, including 32 from Saenuri, announced a draft resolution calling for the National Assembly to come up with measures to have the president step down in an \"orderly\" manner and fill the government vacuum, which exposes the country to increasing risks.\u00a0They also called on the speaker to convene a special session involving all legislators to discuss the solution to the current crisis, before the impeachment motion is put to a vote.

The minister, after a meeting with experts, ruling Saenuri Party officials and representatives from the poultry industry, said it would intensify quarantine around wintering grounds of migratory birds and is also considering cordoning off areas adjacent to migratory bird habitats.In neighboring China, there have been 16 cases of human infections of the H5N6 since 2014.

So we made a commitment as a nation to stay there because our interests required that we stay there.

That's in our interests.\"During campaigning, Trump argued that the US should no longer be the \"policeman of the world,\" expressing deeply negative views of US security commitments overseas and claiming it makes no sense for the US to help defend such wealthy allies as Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia in exchange for little.He has said allies should pay 100 percent of the cost of stationing American troops, or the US should be prepared to end their protection. He even suggested allowing South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce US security burdens.About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

The holiday on Nov. 18 marks the proclamation of the Republic of Latvia in 1918, when the country declared independence from Russia after more than 200 years of occupation. Latvia was subsumed into the Soviet Union in 1940, but became a vibrant democracy and market economy following the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. It became a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this year.\u00a0Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)The Baltic nation established diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1991, and the two opened embassies in each other\u2019s countries last year and in 2013, respectively. \u201cLatvia and Korea are like-minded partners, sharing strong diplomatic ties based on common values of democracy and the rules-based international system,\u201d Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars said at a reception in Seoul on Thursday. Over the past 25 years, the two countries have bolstered cooperation in commerce, culture and community ties, he added, highlighting exchanges in music, art and design and sports in particular.Following Seoul\u2019s inauguration of a diplomatic mission in the Latvian capital of Riga -- the only Korean embassy in the Baltic States -- Latvia followed suit last year. Vaivars is the first residing ambassador. He was previously posted in Tokyo as the top Latvian diplomat, also overseeing Korea.\u201cLatvia has prospered for centuries as the center of rich culture and art, and a commercial hub of the Baltic Sea connecting Europe, Russia and Central Asia,\u201d said Kim Hyoung-zhin, Korea\u2019s deputy foreign minister for political affairs.Of interest, Kim added, Riga has much well-preserved architecture dating back as far as the Middle Ages, earning it the nickname \u201cthe Pearl of the Baltic Sea.\u201d Designated the European Cultural Capital in 2014, Riga has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world. The capital\u2019s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, with many buildings constructed between the 16th and 19th centuries.A major trading hub of northern Europe since its founding in 1201, Riga is the largest city in any of the Baltic States and home to one-third of Latvia\u2019s 2 million people. The capital offers a myriad of festivals and performing arts throughout the year, including choral, opera and ballet concerts and art exhibitions.

He asserted that \u201ctrade will naturally come once we create images of our country\u201d through networking and promotion.Latvia is a multiethnic society with 62 percent of population being Latvian, 26 percent Russian and the rest mostly Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians and others. Its economy is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, which strive to strengthen their competitiveness in the global market with specialized niche products.\u00a0Latvian Ambassador Peteris Vaivars (left) and Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis (Latvian Embassy)According to Vaivars, Latvia is \u201cone of the greenest nations in the world,\u201d with a lush, flat land full of pristine forests, rivers and lakes that produce clean air, water and food. \u201cOur products are made from our clean environment, and we are a regional leader in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food products, furniture, fashion and design,\u201d he said. Popular Latvian food products are seafood, dairy, chocolate and juice, and the country\u2019s aesthetic and functional designs \u2013 resembling the simplistic, utilitarian style of Scandinavia -- are embodied in fashion and furniture.

The special investigation team Sunday indicted Park\u2019s confidante Choi Soon-sil and former presidential aide An Chong-bum for their involvement in coercing corporations to donate funds to the Mir and K-sports foundations, which are suspected of being a cover for channeling funds to Choi. But the prosecution left out bribery charges against the government, citing the lack of evidence. While the arraignment said the companies had \u201cno choice\u201d but to make the donations, it has been suspected that the 77.4 billion won ($65.8 million) of donations were essentially bribes from the biggest and most powerful corporations in the country.The opposition has upped their calls for Park to be investigated for bribery.\u201cThe president had a private meeting with corporate chiefs and demanded that they make contributions to the foundations, and provided favors for them. ...

Kim Boo-kyun of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Over 600,000 citizens gathered in Seoul for an anti-Park protest Saturday, calling for the corporations to be punished and saying they should not be viewed as victims of coercion.While Choi and An have been indicted for coercing money from corporations, it was termed \u201cabuse of power.\u201d Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong walks out of the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul on Monday after attending a hearing for his arrest warrant.

It has been alleged that the money was meant to stop an investigation into the conglomerate, a suspicion further fueled by the fact that the foundation returned the money to Lotte just before the investigators commenced an all-out probe. Hyundai Motor Group, which donated 12.8 billion won and inked multibillion-won deals with companies controlled by Choi\u2019s associates, is also suspected of receiving benefits last year. Under Korean criminal law, abuse of power can be punished by up to five years in prison while bribery is punishable by at least 10 years in prison if the bribe was 100 million won or more.Park has vowed not to cooperate with the investigation, claiming that the charges against her are baseless.Officials from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office said Monday that it is realistically difficult to take Park into custody, as the Constitution does not allow Park to be prosecuted. With the investigation limited, the prosecution is expected to focus on proving the bribery charges. Prosecutor General Kim Soo-nam has reportedly ordered investigators to apply bribery charges to whoever necessary, if evidence is found.The investigators continued to close in on Park by requesting an arrest warrant for former Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Cho Won-dong.

A poll released Monday by a local daily said at least 31 Saenuri lawmakers are willing to vote for Park\u2019s impeachmentGiven that the Assembly law states that the impeachment motions should be put to a secret vote, opposition parties rushed to come up with a measure to ensure that dissenting Saenuri members would vote across the political spectrum. The People\u2019s Party said Monday that they would launch a campaign to gather the signatures of more than 200 Saenuri lawmakers approving the impeachment. Democratic Party\u2019s former leader Rep. Moon-Jae echoed the move, saying that the measure can help constituents convince their representatives to join the impeachment and prevent hesitant lawmakers from changing their mind during the voting session. \u201cWe have to make sure that the lawmakers reveal to the public whether they will approve or disapprove the impeachment. If some lawmakers refuse to do that, the voters can protest against their decision and help them change their mind,\u201d said Moon during press conference Monday. Another concern lingering among the opposition bloc is on the Constitutional Court: Even if the impeachment motion gained bipartisan support and subsequently cleared the Assembly, the measure would eventually be scrapped unless six out of nine judges in the court approve it.The judges are dominated by conservative scholars appointed by President Park, her predecessor Lee Myung-bak and their governing Saenuri Party. And they are known to have applied strict standards when reviewing an impeachment motion. The Constitution stipulates that a sitting president can be impeached by the Assembly when he or she is found to have violated the Constitution or other laws. When the Assembly passed the motion against the late President Roh Moo-hyun and referred it to the Constitutional Court in 2004, the judges rejected the motion for the reason that the allegations were not \u201cgrave enough.\u201dBut opposition leaders have noted that the charges facing President Park, who prosecutors say played a key role in the influence-peddling and bribery scandal tied to Choi, is more serious than that of her predecessor Roh, who was subject to impeachment for violating political neutrality.\u201cIf the Assembly passes the impeachment, the investigation result indicating the president\u2019s criminal act is compelling enough to convince the Constitutional Court of delivering a rational decision,\u201d said Democratic Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae on Monday. People\u2019s Party leader Rep. Park Jie-won warned against the possibility that the impeachment motion would face a stricter quorum in the Constitutional Court --\u00a0 six out of seven judges -- as two of the incumbent judges are to retire early next yearTo avoid such a scenario, Rep. Keum Tae-sub, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, urged lawmakers to seek options to promptly finish the impeachment procedure by Jan 1, 2017, before the two outgoing judges leave office.

It said that Park received briefings or issued directives, related to the tragedy, some 30 times on April 16 when the ferry Sewol sank in waters off the southwestern island of Jindo, leaving some 300 passengers, mostly young students, dead or missing.It marks the first time that the presidential office has clarified through it\u2019s website Park\u2019s exact location on the day of the sinking. Cheong Wa Dae posted information on its official website in a section dedicated to \u201ccorrecting false reports and rumors.\u201d(Yonhap)The new revelation, however, is unlikely to quell the controversy over Park\u2019s mishandling of the national disaster. It only reconfirmed that the president was never briefed by anyone in person or held a meeting, while the nation watched the ferry slowly sink on live TV, with hundreds of students on a class trip trapped inside. In an indication of her lack of understanding of the situation, Park had showed up at the disaster control center at around 5:15 p.m., seven hours after the incident, and asked, \u201cWhy is it hard to find those students? I heard they all had life vests on.\u201d This had given rise to rumors that she may have been absent from Cheong Wa Dae for the seven hours or for some reason unable to tend to her duties. The presidential office, last week, denied one of the rumors that Park was under anesthesia related to a cosmetic medical procedure. Rep. Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party lambasted Cheong Wa Dae\u2019s new explanation, saying it means Park never left her home that day, not even for her own office. \u201cThat Park used her office in residence is synonymous with that Park did not even come to work that day,\u201d said Moon, who served as the chief of staff to the late President Roh Moo-hyun.\u201cWhat did you do during those urgent hours, not come to work?\u201d the opposition political asked.

Many middle and high school students are disappointed at how Choi\u2019s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, was illegally admitted to a top university and received special treatment there. \u201cShe did not study or make the appropriate effort but had the privilege of going to the university because she was born into a powerful family,\u201d Kwon Ha-kyeong, a 16-year-old student, told The Korea Herald at Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cWhile we are forced to study hard to get good grades, all she needed was her powerful parents.\u201dThree students hold signs reading \u201cExpel Park Geun-hye\u201d at a rally in front of Bosingak Bell, central Seoul on Saturday. (Jo He-rim\/The Korea Herald)In the unfolding Choi scandal that even threatens Park\u2019s presidency, allegations concerning Chung may appear trivial. Choi is accused of much more serious crimes such as extorting billions of won from the country\u2019s top conglomerates. However, the anger and frustration felt by South Korean teenagers goes beyond just Chung -- it is a reflection of their dissatisfaction with society. \u201cI am disappointed at the current society. It is full of unfair competition,\u201d Kim Ie-tae, 17, said at Saturday\u2019s rally. In South Korea, where many consider education to be a top priority, students are often pushed to study hard to enter a good university. The Choi scandal, however, seems to deny what they have been told and believe in -- hard work eventually pays off. On Friday, the Education Ministry confirmed that the 19-year-old dressage rider Chung had been accepted to Ewha Womans University in Seoul with false academic records. Her mother, Choi, had pulled strings behind the scenes to get her daughter special treatment in educational and sports circles.The university, which had previously denied the allegations against Chung, issued a public apology and decided to annul her acceptance.The sinking of the Sewol Ferry in April 2014 also drove many teens to the streets.\u201cI cannot believe the president\u2019s whereabouts are unknown after the Sewol Ferry incident happened. I could not help but come here,\u201d said 18-year-old rally participant Kim Soo-yeon. The Sewol Ferry sank while heading to Jeju Island, leaving more than 300 dead. It had been carrying 475 passengers, including 324 students on a class trip. The public had heavily criticized the president\u2019s failure in handling the situation and Park\u2019s whereabouts for seven hours on the day of the disaster still remain in question. Changes in society might also be the reason behind teenagers\u2019 willingness to take part in the demonstration Saturday. \u201cYoung people and teenagers are participating more and care more about current affairs because more adults are willing to hear our voices,\u201d said Kim Ji-yoon, a high school senior who took the national college entrance exam Thursday. \u201cThere are more of us (students) willing to speak out about state matters as citizens of South Korea as well, even though we are young.\u201dOn the day of Suneung -- the annual college scholastic ability exam -- , a teenagers\u2019 group called Hope held a candle light vigil in which some 70 students demanded the president step down from her post. Most of them were high school seniors who came after taking their big exam earlier that day. \u201cMy cousin who\u2019s a year older than me retook the exam today with me because she failed to go to the very school Chung was so easily accepted to last year,\u201d a high school senior Jeong Eun-seon said at the rally. \u201cI was also a student athlete (like Chung) but I hurt my back and gave up my goal.\u201dHope also organized a demonstration Saturday. Some 600 students gathered for the rally held in front of Youngpoong Bookstore in Jongno, central Seoul, calling for the resignation of President Park.Just hundred meters away was another group of middle and high school students, under the group name \u201cTeens\u2019 Evolution.\u201d They held a rally against the president in front of the Bosingak Bell in Jongno. The organizers estimated some 500 participants. Participating teens were not all members of the organizations but came to the rallies after they saw posts and articles about the rallies on social networks, they said. \u201cI saw a Facebook post (about today\u2019s rally) and decided to participate,\u201d said Kim Hyung-sub, a sophomore at a high school in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. After announcing their official denunciation of the scandal in a statement at 3 p.m., Hope marched down the streets through Euljiro 1-ga Station and pass City Hall to reach the Seoul Finance Center near Gwanghwamun Square where the main candle light vigil was held.

These sites are usually near river basins and deltas, where rivers meet the sea.\u00a0 A flock of migratory birds flies over the Geum River. (Geumgang Migratory Bird Observatory)However, bird-watchers should be careful not to disturb the sensitive migratory creatures. The Environment Ministry advises observers to keep a distance of at least 30 meters and not disturb nature. Field glasses or binoculars are commonly used to watch birds, while sudden movements are also discouraged as it can drive them away. Birds have a wide field of vision, with eyes that can see at least eight to 40 times better than humans, according to the ministry. Therefore, bird-watchers should avoid brightly colored outfits and choose instead to wear green or brown to blend in with their surroundings. Littering and damaging trees or grass in bird-watching areas is also prohibited.\u00a0Seocheon County, South Chungcheong ProvinceOne of the biggest sanctuaries is located on the edges of one of the nation\u2019s biggest rivers, the Geumgang, where over 50,000 migratory birds spanning 40 species flock every year.

Egret and critically endangered species such as cranes come and go through the region from October to March. Eagles have also been spotted flying in the area. Nakdonggang Estuary, South Gyeongsang ProvinceAnother designated natural monument, the Nakdonggang Estuary, is also popular with migratory birds. Wetlands, reed fields and mud flats surround the region, providing abundant food for winged visitors. Snipes and different kinds of plovers flock to the vast region. Furthermore, the waters in the estuary do not freeze due to the relatively warm temperature in winter, which attracts diverse kinds of birds. Some rare white-naped cranes and spoonbills can sometimes be seen.

Kim Su-ho, a local vet for wild birds\u00a0with over 20 years of experience, says he is able to tell the difference between cranes that have been there before and those visiting for the first time. \u201cI recognize the cranes.

Last year, some 20 million migratory birds, including some 800 cranes, flew here. Magnificent sights of vultures, red-crowned cranes and white-tailed sea eagles taking off en masse draw hundreds of bird-watchers to Cheorwon and other major migratory bird sanctuaries every winter. While humans have only been able to track down just three major flyways across Asia so far, the routes followed by migratory birds on their journeys have been passed down from generation to generation among birds, ecology experts said.\u201cIt is instinct for birds to fly in flocks toward feeding and resting sites,\u201d said Kim Kyung-won, a bird expert and environmental campaigner at the World Wildlife Fund in Seoul.\u201cImagine if the birds one day have to find a new place to land during winter, because their habitats and stopover sites have been destroyed. That would not only lead them to lose their way. It could lead to their extinction,\u201d Kim said. He highlighted that mudflats in some major wild life sanctuaries have already been converted to dry land for agriculture and industrial development. \u201cThe expansive mudflats are normally rich in marine worms and crustaceans, which many shorebirds depend on for food.\u201dAccording to ecology expert Richard Fuller, only one third of Asia\u2019s mudflat habitat remains compared to 50 years ago.

It concerns evidence that Choi was allowed to meddle in state affairs and misappropriate public funds. \u201cIf it can help wrap up the investigation on allegations related to the president, I will finish preparing for my defense as soon as possible and cooperate so that investigation on the president can take place next week,\u201d said Park\u2019s lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha.Earlier in the day, the prosecution had delivered a virtual ultimatum on calling in Park for an interview, saying it would be nearly impossible for them to question her over the weekend. \u201cI think it will be physically difficult (to question Park) during the weekend.

A few outspoken liberals have been calling for Park\u2019s impeachment from the very beginning of the scandal surrounding the conservative president and her friend for 40 years Choi Soon-sil, but most in the liberal opposition bloc are reluctant to talk about the possibility of the extreme measure.\u00a0\u00a0 Ironically, the embattled president herself and some members of her governing Saenuri Party seem to prefer the scenario involving impeachment.\u00a0 \u201cImpeachment is something that the legislative body discusses in accordance with the Constitution. There is nothing we can do about it,\u201d said the presidential office Tuesday. To understand the rationale behind the opposition\u2019s aversion to an impeachment campaign as well as Park\u2019s preference for it, one has to look into the complicated process -- as described in the Korean Constitution -- of impeaching and removing a sitting president. It is quite different from that of the US. Impeachment procedure\u00a0 First, the impeachment motion.To set in motion an effort to impeach the president, South Korea\u2019s unicameral, 300-member National Assembly must pass a motion for it by a two-third vote. Park\u2019s foes -- three liberal opposition groups and liberal-minded independents -- have 171 votes, 29 short of the required quorum. This means that assuming there is no dissenting votes from the opposition bloc, at least 29 Saenuri members have to agree to impeach Park. Within Saenuri, which has 121 lawmakers, voices calling for Park\u2019s early departure from the presidential office are growing. Yet, it is unclear how many of its legislators would cast their votes across the aisle to support an opposition-led motion. A poll by a local daily, released earlier this week, put the number of lawmakers willing to vote for Park\u2019s forced ouster at 18. Among them could be former party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, as he has publicly called for Park\u2019s impeachment.\u00a0 Once the motion is through, the Constitutional Court will determine the president\u2019s fate. In the US, the final decision is made by the Senate. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk (left) shakes hands with his opposition counterpart Woo Sang-ho during a plenary session at the National Assembly on Thursday. (Yonhap)In Korea, the top court will deliberate whether the president has violated the Constitution or law to deserve a dismissal. So, the court\u2019s finding could deviate from the public opinion.A decision to unseat Park requires consent from at least six of its nine judges. The problem is that the ideological composition of the judges is largely stacked against the president\u2019s foes. Currently, seven out of the nine members are considered to be leaning right.\u00a0 By law, the president, chief justice of the Supreme Court and the National Assembly can each appoint three judges. To make it even worse, two of the incumbent judges are to retire early next year. The looming vacancies could work against those seeking to oust Park, because they would need consent from six out of seven, not nine, judges. The court must offer their ruling within 180 days upon receiving the motion from the Assembly.\u00a0 While the court deliberates, the prime minister replaces the role of the president. If the legislative body fails to appoint the nation\u2019s second-in-command, incumbent Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, appointed by Park, would run the state. The president is removed from office immediately, once the court approves of the motion. The nation would then have to elect a new president within 60 days. The newly elected president is granted a five-year term regardless of how much time was left in the outgoing president\u2019s term.\u00a0Risk of pursuing impeachment There are three reasons for the opposition parties\u2019 reluctance to impeach the president: Difficulty in proving President Park\u2019s violation of the Constitution, a high threshold of passing an impeachment motion at the Constitutional Court, and uncertainty surrounding an arduous impeachment process. After all, the key is not the public sentiment or the legislature\u2019s act of no-confidence in Park. The Constitutional Court will have to be convinced that Park\u2019s wrongdoings are grave enough to warrant her removal. Among the allegations facing Park now is that she abused her power to extract money from conglomerates and leak confidential document to her longtime friend Choi. But the prosecutors have yet to find direct evidence linking the charges to the president herself and plans for a face-to-face investigation with Park have been stalled. So far, the president has admitted to the fact that she sought some help from Choi when writing her speeches.Outside of criminal charges against the president, Constitutional experts noted that Park violated the basic law for disrupting fundamental democratic values -- such as rule of law -- by allowing an unelected individual like Choi to meddle in state affairs. \u201cImpeaching the president can be justified if the president loses her ability to manage state affairs,\u201d said Han Sang-hee, a law professor at Seoul-based Konkuk University. \u201cIn that regard, I think we have enough case to pursue the impeachment.\u201d Another predicament lies in the high threshold for the impeachment motion to get passed by the Constitutional Court, whose nine members are mostly dominated by judges elected by President Park and her conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak. For the impeachment to take place, six or more judges need to approve the motion. Currently, six members were appointed by the two conservative presidents and their governing Saenuri Party. And the judges are inclined to apply strict standards when reviewing the impeachment motion. In 2004, the late President Roh Moo-hyun was subject to impeachment for violation of political neutrality, however, the judges rejected the motion, saying the allegation was not \u201cgrave enough\u201d for the impeachment. The last reason is that impeachment is a time-consuming process. Even if the independent counsel is launched this week after the lawmakers pass the bill aiming to name the special prosecutors, the lawmakers have to wait up to 120 days until the prosecutors announce the investigation result. Combined with the up to 180 days of legal review conducted by the Constitutional Court and 60 days of transition period until the nation elects a new president, the whole process would last up to 360 days and end when the president has almost finished her five-year term. Opposition parties are concerned that the time-consuming process will aggravate the political deadlock and attract public protest that could hurt their political fate. In 2004, the then opposition parties were defeated in general elections after they pushed to impeach late President Roh.

Starting this year, all test-takers must take a separate Korean history exam during the social and natural sciences test time. A test-taker arrives on police patrol bike. (Yonhap)The test started at 8:30 a.m. with a plan to run through 5:40 p.m., including lunch and breaks, the ministry said. As in previous years, the government imposed various traffic control and anti-noise measures as part of its efforts to ensure that the test be executed without any problems. Subways and trains in the capital area extended their rush hour services by two hours to help all exam-takers arrive at the test sites on time. Bus operations were also expanded during the commuting time. The stock markets will open for trade one hour late, while government offices and enterprises in nearby areas also plan to open an hour later than usual to keep the roads clear for students on their way to the test centers, it said.Police said they will mobilize 14,000 officers to support the ministry running the exam, while offering to transport students in need of a ride by patrol cars or on the back of motorcycles. Test applicants were banned from having electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, electronic calculators and smartwatches, at their desks to prevent possible cheating, the ministry said. The applicants will be individually notified of their test results on Dec. 7, according to the ministry.

We (prosecutors) said it was necessary to do it today. ... We plan to tell them that if we were to concede beyond the \u2018Maginot Line\u2019 (absolute final deadline), Friday would be possible,\u201d a high-ranking official from Seoul Central Prosecutors\u2019 Office said.Park is suspected of being directly involved in the scandal, which includes allegations that Choi had meddled in state affairs and siphoned off public funds.The official said that the prosecution remains unchanged on its position that Park will be probed not as a suspect, but as a key witness in the case. This makes it impossible for the investigators to forcibly question her, as it would not be permitted to take her into custody.If the president chooses not to comply with the prosecution\u2019s questioning, it will be forced to reach a decision accordingly, he said.Suspicions that Park is directly involved in the Choi scandal have been further fueled in the past few days, with evidence uncovered from her former aides.An Chong-bum (Yonhap)The prosecution\u2019s investigation into former presidential secretary An Chong-bum reportedly found that he had received orders from Park about raising funds for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation. The two nonprofit organizations are suspected of being used as a cover to channel money to Choi.According to local media outlet Munhwa Ilbo, An\u2019s notebook confiscated by the investigators showed that Park had given direct instructions about the foundations from day one, requesting regular updates on their progress. It even specified how a company effectively owned by TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek -- an associate of Choi -- should produce much of state-related advertisements.\u00a0 Cha is currently being investigated on charges of using his relationship with Choi for illegal gains, such as pressuring another company to give up majority shares of an advertisement company.An has already testified to the prosecution that he was just following Park\u2019s orders on the fundraising.Jeong Ho-seong(Yonhap)Last week, the prosecution found text messages on a phone of another former presidential aide, Jeong Ho-seong, related to Park\u2019s private meeting with the chiefs of seven of Korea\u2019s largest corporations. Park is suspected of pressuring the company heads to donate to the foundations.The confiscated phone also showed that Park had given specific instructions about Choi, prosecutors said.According to the investigators, one of the messages showed Park asking if he had received confirmation from Choi. She had referred to Choi as \u201ca teacher,\u201d which in Korean is also used as a term of respect.A voice recording from Jeong\u2019s phone also showed that Choi gave specific instructions on a variety of reports being sent to Cheong Wa Dae.Rep. Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, said Wednesday that the prosecution should treat Park as a suspect if she continues to not cooperate with the investigation.\u201cShe was the one who promised (to cooperate). Complying with the investigation is the first step to uncovering the truth.

The rally\u2019s organizers -- a union of over 1,500 civic and labor groups -- are trying a different tactic this Saturday. Instead of having all the participants flock to Seoul\u2019s Gwanghwamun area, numerous smaller-scale rallies will take place all around the country. A record-breaking 1 million people gathered in central Seoul last week to demand the resignation of the beleaguered Park, who is accused of letting her friend Choi manipulate state affairs behind the scenes. Busan, the country\u2019s second-largest city, might see as many as 100,000 protesters, according to a local rally organizer comprising some 100 civic organizations.\u00a0 Across the country, rallies are planned at some 100 locations. A union of some 80 civic organizations in North Chungcheong Province expects a turnout of about 10,000 for its rally. On Jeju Island, a candlelight vigil is expected to draw up to 5,000 residents. Meanwhile, an online club that supports President Park is planning to hold a counter-rally in front of Seoul Station on Saturday. While it is not clear how many of the 73,000-member group will turn up, it is highly likely they will be outnumbered by anti-Park protesters.

In September, the North conducted its fifth and the strongest-ever nuclear test, drawing strong condemnation from the international community. The UNSC immediately launched the process of drawing up a resolution, but it has been delayed reportedly due in part to a failure by Washington and Beijing to iron out their differences. The focus has been placed on how to cover the \"loopholes\" in the previous resolution adopted in March after the North's fourth nuclear test in the same month, which allowed trade related to the livelihood of the North Korean people. The North is suspected of taking advantage of it in acquiring hard currency necessary to continue its missile and nuclear programs.The US has pushed to remove the \"exception\" but failed to enlist support from China, the closest ally to Pyongyang. The North's coal exports account for the largest portion of its trade with China.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","380":"The Third Committee of the UN General Assembly passed a North Korean human rights resolution Tuesday that calls for referring the situation to the International Criminal Court and expresses serious concerns about Pyongyang's labor exports.The resolution, which was approved by consensus, is certain to be formally adopted at a plenary General Assembly meeting next month as the session is seen largely as a formality. It marks the 12th straight year for the General Assembly to adopt a North Korean human rights resolution.In particular, it is the third consecutive year for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution calling on the Security Council to refer the North's human rights situation to the ICC. That underlines the seriousness with which the international community views the situation.This year's resolution blamed the North's \"leadership\" for human rights abuses.\u00a0The Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly holds a meeting to adopt a resolution on North Korea's human rights situation on Nov. 15. (Yonhap)\"The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to ... take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court and consideration of the further development of sanctions,\" the resolution said.The resolution also expresses \"very serious concern\" at \"the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced labor.\" It is the first time a General Assembly resolution has mentioned the North's labor exports, which have become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang amid concern that the funds could be used for its nuclear and missile programs.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.The 2014 General Assembly resolution is considered a watershed moment in international efforts to improve the North's human rights situation as it marked the first time for the Assembly to call for the North's referral to the ICC.That resolution led to the UN Security Council holding consultations on the issue for the first time later that year. In addition, a similar resolution was adopted last year and the Security Council also held discussions on the North's human rights situation for the second time.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.After Tuesday's passage, Amb. Kim In-ryong, deputy chief of the North's mission to the UN, told a news conference that the country \"categorically rejects\" the resolution, claiming it has \"political purposes to defame and eliminate the DPRK as well as it is based on lies and fabricated information.\"North Korean officials were also asked about the results of the US presidential election.\"We don't care about who becomes US president,\" said Kim Yong-ho, a North Korean Foreign Ministry director in charge of human rights issues. \"The fundamental issue is whether the US has a political will to withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\"Asked whether the North would allow the UN special rapporteur on North Korea's human rights situation, Tomas Ojea Quintana, to visit the country, Kim said Ojea Quintana is welcome to visit as a law professor from Buenos Aires, but his visit as special rapporteur won't be granted.South Korea welcomed the latest resolution on human rights in the North, calling it the \"toughest-ever\" one aimed at sending strong warnings to Pyongyang bent on missile and nuclear weapons while turning a blind eye to its people's livelihood. \"The government urges (the North) to take detailed and practical measures immediately in accordance with the UN resolution to improve human rights conditions for its citizens,\" Seoul's foreign ministry said in a comment issued in the name of spokesman Cho June-hyuck.

They include the accusation US allies are \u201cfreeloading\u201d on defense, and he even seemed to toy with the prospect of pulling US forces out of South Korea unless the host country shoulders more of the financial burden.Karl W. Eikenberry, a director of the US-Asia Security Initiative at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, highlighted that presidential candidates often have a history of making pledges with little or no intent to follow up.\u201cSuch talks did begin to disappear this summer and fall. And two-thirds of the Americans surveyed have said that they support the (Seoul-Washington) alliance and forward-stationing of the US forces in peninsula,\u201d he said during \u201cThe New US Administration\u2019s East Asian Policy and the Korean Peninsula\u201d session jointly hosted by think tanks Sejong Institute and APARC.Eikenberry -- formerly US ambassador to Afghanistan -- stressed that as of yet, Trump is not likely to have detailed plans about the issue of defense strategies, as he lacks aides considered part of the traditional national security establishment.\u201cHe knows he has to rely on the experiences of others. The selection of Vice President-elect Mike Pence to lead his transition team indicates that this is the case,\u201d he said, indicating the selection of the seasoned politician Pence shows that Trump will be open to the wisdom of his trusted aides.\u201cWe should expect (a) President Trump who has a defense strategy that is informed and implemented by the expertise of those cabinet and agency officials.\u201dMichael McFaul, director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford, assessed Trump \u201cwould not have the slightest grasp\u201d of many of the foreign policy and security issues, and that professionals could fill in the blanks.A panel discuses the likely policy directions of the incoming US administration led by Donald Trump at a forum in Seoul on Tuesday, jointly organized by Korea\u2019s Sejong Institute and the Asia-Pacific Research Center of Stanford University in the US. (Yonhap)Former US Ambassador to South Korea Kathleen Stephens said there have been concerns during previous transitions of administrations about policies being uprooted. This was particularly the case with Jimmy Carter, who had an \u201cexplicit platform\u201d of withdrawing all troops from South Korea. \u201cBut my general observation here is this, that we survived all this. And our alliance did indeed continue to mature. So I think that gives us some grounds for optimism,\u201d Stephens, a William J. Perry distinguished fellow at the APARC, said.She added that more talks related to defense arrangements in South Korea are likely to occur in the future. This includes costs related to the upcoming deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, and possibly accelerating the transfer of wartime operation control from US to South Korea. But Stephens stressed it is \u201ctruly unpredictable what kind of president he would be,\u201d as the panels agreed Trump\u2019s administration will likely spark many questions. McFaul said he was worried a Trump meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin without sufficient preparation would bring unintended negative consequences, as he may attempt to cut a deal while disconnected from advisers.

In 2006, the SNU announced NT-1 was most likely to be produced by the virgin birth method, citing its genetic fingerprint and refuted Hwang's claim. A research team at the Harvard Medical School also supported the SNU's conclusion and published the result in the scientific journal Cell Stem Cell in 2007.The government has banned all research using human eggs after Hwang was convicted in 2009 for embezzlement.A series of research projects in the field have sparked calls for lowering the high regulatory barrier to allow local scientists to conduct stem cell and regenerative medicine research over the past years.In July, the government approved CHA University's embryonic stem cell research seven years after it submitted the plan, on condition that it abides by high ethical standards.Since being removed from professorship, Hwang has served as a senior researcher at Sooam Biotech Research Foundation and the head of Hbion, a bio firm specializing in animal cloning and the stem cell cosmetics business.

The master plan encompasses five strategic areas of sustainable infrastructure, digital innovation, seamless logistics, effective regulation and people\u2019s mobility.In the afternoon session, member states\u2019 representatives provided up-to-date information on current and future infrastructure projects, followed by business meetings between ASEAN officials and potential Korean investors.\u00a0ASEAN-Korea Center secretary-general Kim Young-sun (ASEAN-Korea Center)\u201cASEAN\u2019s efforts to enhance connectivity will help narrow the development gap, the main obstacle to achieving a genuinely integrated bloc,\u201d argued Lee Tae-ho, Korea\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs. \u201cThese efforts will serve as a foundation for the sustainable growth of ASEAN.\u201dCooperation through connectivity-related projects will also strengthen the ASEAN-Korea relations, the diplomat argued, noting that the two sides have pushed forward their ties since establishing the Sectoral Dialogue Partnership in 1989. Over the last 25 years, the total two-way trade volume increased 15-fold, Korea\u2019s investment in ASEAN 21-fold, and people-to-people exchange 29-fold. The two sides have a \u201cclose, symbiotic relationship\u201d according to the minister, who mentioned the ASEAN has become Korea\u2019s second-largest trade partner and investment destination after China. Last month, the ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee and its Dialogue Partners gathered in Vientiane, Laos, where the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 was adopted. Highlighting that financing and resource mobilization are \u201cthe most critical elements\u201d of the master plan, Lee said ASEAN needs to invest a minimum of $110 billion in infrastructure each year to sustain its future growth. In an effort to contribute to these projects, Seoul has provided some $500 million in official development assistance to ASEAN, which accounts for more than one-third of the country\u2019s overseas contributions. \u201cDespite public financing\u2019s importance, national budget and development assistance cannot wholly satisfy the rapidly rising demand for connectivity schemes,\u201d he claimed. \u201cPublic-private partnerships are becoming more important, as they complement government contributions and utilize the private sector\u2019s efficiency, expertise, experience and technology.\u201d The newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is likely to expand the scope of bankable projects under the master plan, the envoy added.\u00a0The fourth annual ASEAN Connectivity Forum (ASEAN-Korea Center)Thant Sin Maung, Myanmar\u2019s Union Minister for Transport and Communications, said \u201csmooth and seamless\u201d intraregional transportation facilitates trade and economic growth, reduces regional gaps and fortifies relations and integration.The master plan for the feasibility study on establishing the ASEAN Roll-On Roll-Off Network and Short Sea Shipping, ASEAN Highway Network Projects and Singapore Kunming Rail Link Projects has been implemented. Air transport services have been liberalized toward a single aviation market, and intraregional shipping services have been streamlined, according to Thant. Latsamy Keomany, Lao PDR Permanent Representative to ASEAN and Chair of ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee, said \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made in fleshing out the master plan, but there were challenges in mobilizing the resources and harmonizing regional initiatives with national plans. \u201cThe productivity of infrastructure needs to improve rapidly,\u201d Latsamy said, adding that new approaches should be sought in guiding the sustainable growth of mid-sized cities across the region. There are ample examples of \u201csmart urbanization\u201d initiatives across ASEAN, he underscored, referring to George Town\u2019s heritage protection, Medan\u2019s efforts at curbing automobile dependency and boosting pedestrian-friendly transportation and Da Nang\u2019s institutional strengthening and corruption fighting.

Daily candlelight vigils will be held in major cities, with university students planning to stage rallies simultaneously at several locations in Seoul on Tuesday. Under the theme \u201cFinding Hidden Sovereignty,\u201d university students will gather at four locations from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m to light candles and make impromptu speeches. They are set to march around the area with white masks covering their faces. The students who organized the event said on their Facebook page that they wanted to reach out to more people in a new way other than the conventional street demonstration. Around 1,500 students have already signed up to participate, they said. On Saturday, more students are expected to fill the streets, in particular 19-year-old students who will take their college entrance exams Thursday. Last Saturday\u2019s protest, the largest since Korea\u2019s democratization in 1987, was mostly peaceful, without major clashes reported. Police reported 64 injuries, all minor ones.

Jeong has already been put under detention over similar allegations.The questioning comes a day after the prosecution announced it would carry out direct questioning of the president early this week to investigate her role in the widening scandal surrounding Choi.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae is expected to announce how it will proceed with the questioning around Tuesday.

On April 16, 2014, while the nation was gripped by shock and sorrow after watching on live TV the ferry\u2019s slow sinking, with over 300, mostly students, trapped inside, Park did not make a public appearance until late in the afternoon. She showed up at the disaster control center at around 5:15 p.m., seven hours after the incident, and asked, \u201cWhy is it hard to find those students? I heard they all had life vests on.\u201d This gave rise to suspicions that Park might have been absent or for some reason unable to attend to her duties as head of the government for the seven hours. As criticism mounted, Cheong Wa Dae at that time had explained that Park received reports on the incident 15 times in total and gave instructions twice for a swift rescue operation. But they were all written reports and she was never briefed by anyone in person. Even the presidential chief of staff said he was not aware of her exact whereabouts.

They initiated the pact in 2012, but Seoul suspended its signing as opposition parties and civic groups claimed the deal was arranged too hastily and in secret.\"South Korea and Japan will hold a third round of working-level talks and tentatively sign the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) next week,\" Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun said in a press briefing.In the two rounds of talks held in Tokyo on Nov. 1 and Seoul on Nov. 9, they reached an agreement on major terms. The defense ministry has asked the Korea Ministry of Government Legislation(MOLEG) to review the agreed terms through the foreign ministry, Moon said.After the initial review by the MOLEG, the agreement will be examined by related vice ministers and then sent to the Cabinet for approval this month. All the procedures will be handled by the foreign ministry, the spokesman said.In the past two rounds of talks, the two agreed on these terms: intelligence information obtained by them should not be provided to a third country without each other's approval; only permitted officials will gain access to military information; a notice to the information providing country should be made immediately if information is lost or damaged, the ministry said.The pact, if clinched, will likely set the stage for both countries to share more extensive military information on North Korea. Seoul will get access to intelligence collected by Japan's surveillance satellites and Aegis-equipped destroyers. In December 2014, South Korea, the US and Japan signed a preliminary deal that calls for voluntary sharing of military secrets on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The deal allowed Seoul and Tokyo to share such intelligence via the US after their bilateral pact fell through in 2012. Defense Minister Han Min-koo has told lawmakers that the bilateral pact would help Seoul counter increasing threats from the nuclear-armed communist regime.But opposition parties said that it is still inappropriate to ink the information-sharing deal, given Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has not sincerely apologized for Japan's wartime wrongdoings while moving to expand Japan's military role overseas. North Korea's repeated provocations provided strong momentum for Seoul and Tokyo to resume discussions about GSOMIA. The communist country conducted two nuclear tests this year alone following detonations of nuclear devices in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Defying international condemnation, North Korea has also test-fired more than 20 ballistic missiles so far this year including intermediate-range Musudan and submarine-launched missiles.Currently, Seoul maintains pacts with 32 countries on sharing military information. It has recently asked China to start negotiations on such a pact, but China has not responded yet.

That shows the U.S. is determined to increase pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.The annual talks also came after reports that the U.S. Department of Commerce has looking into whether Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. exported goods containing American technology to North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Syria. These decisions could be a message to China not to relax pressure on the North amid signs of a thaw in relations between Beijing and Pyongyang. Earlier this week, a top envoy of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un paid a visit to Chinese President Xi Jinping and the two sides expressed their willingness to improve strained relations.U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel said earlier this week that ensuring pressure on the North will be a key topic for the upcoming talks with China.

In 2014, irregular workers, who accounted for 20 percent of the workers at conglomerates with more than 300 staff members, made up nearly 40 percent of those who died of fatal work accidents, according to the Labor Ministry. A 2014 survey on 791 irregular workers by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea showed that irregular workers are more vulnerable to work accidents because they tend to be assigned heavier workload and more dangerous jobs.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","416":"North Korea is showing signs that it is preparing or has already begun reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to harvest plutonium for nuclear weapons, a U.S. website monitoring the communist nation said Tuesday, citing recent satellite imagery.The assessment by the website 38 North is similar to that of the Institute for Science and International Security that last week cited as possible evidence of reprocessing activity the presence of container tanks in front of the reprocessing plant and smoke from a coal-fired plant providing steam for reprocessing activity.38 North also cited the presence of two railroad flatcars at the reprocessing facility loaded \"with casks or tanks that may be associated with chemicals used in a reprocessing campaign\" and a small exhaust plume at the facility's thermal plant.Both ISIS and 38 North reached their assessments based on commercial satellite imagery taken on May 22.\"Exactly how much new plutonium Pyongyang can produce if such a campaign is underway remains unclear given uncertainties about the level of operations at the 5 MWe reactor which restarted in 2013,\" 38 North said. \"At maximum capacity, the reactor could produce approximately 6 kilograms of plutonium per year, probably enough for two nuclear weapons,\" it said.Earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a worldwide threat assessment that the North had restarted its 5-megawatt reactor and has since run it long enough to harvest plutonium \"within a matter of weeks to months.\" The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods that, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make one bomb a year.The reactor has provided Pyongyang with weapons-grade plutonium that the regime used in its first three nuclear tests, in 2006,2009 and 2013.

(Yonhap)","418":"BEIJING (AFP) - A top North Korean official made a rare visit to China on Tuesday in an apparent attempt by Pyongyang to mend frayed ties with its powerful neighbour.China is North Korea\u2018s largest trading partner and has been its key diplomatic protector for decades. But relations have soured following Pyongyang\u2019s internationally-condemned nuclear tests, with Beijing supporting UN sanctions against its isolated neighbour.The visit by Ri Su Yong, vice chairman of the North\u2018s ruling Workers\u2019 Party and former foreign minister, came even as South Korea said Tuesday the North had tried and failed to launch a powerful new medium-range missile.The attempted launch is the latest in a series of setbacks for a ballistic weapons programme that aspires to threaten the US mainland.UN resolutions ban North Korea from any use of ballistic missile technology, although it regularly fires short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast.Ri Su Yong met Chinese official Song Tao, head of the international department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee, to brief him on the North\u2018s once-in-a-generation party congress, according to the CCP. North Korea held its first party congress for nearly 40 years in early May, formally endorsing leader Kim Jong-Un\u2019s policy of expanding the country\u2018s nuclear arsenal.The lack of any official Chinese representation at the congress was viewed as a sign of friction between the two traditional allies.\u201cBoth sides pledged to cherish the traditional friendship, strengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d the website of the CCP\u2019s international department said of Tuesday\u2018s visit.Kim has not visited China since coming to power and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping has not visited Pyongyang.But the North Korean leader watched the local Sobaeksu basketball team beat China\u2019s Olympic squad in three matches on Monday, Pyongyang\u2018s official news agency reported.Kim \u201cexpressed great satisfaction over the successful game\u201d, it said.China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said Ri would visit for three days as part of a delegation.He is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit China since last year, when Kim Jong-Un\u2018s close aide Choe Ryong Hae attended a military parade in Beijing to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II.South Korea\u2018s foreign ministry said Tuesday it \u201chopes relations between North Korea and China will advance in a way that could contribute to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula (and) get the North to give up its nuclear weapons.\"","419":"North Korea on Tuesday attempted yet another launch of its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile that ended in failure, sending mixed signals to the international community less than two weeks after proposing talks with Seoul.According to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the missile was fired around 5:20 a.m. in Wonsan, Gangwon Province.\u201cThe North has consistently been attempting ballistic missile launches since Kim gave the orders (for a ballistic missile test launch) on March 15. The military is on full alert in case of further provocations by the North,\u201d said a JCS official. He added that additional analysis is necessary on details of the launch.YonhapThe Ministry of National Defense refused to formally comment on how far the missile flew but a military official said that the military was unable to determine the direction of the launch, indicating that the flight was too brief to determine even the rough course. There have been speculations within the military that it may have exploded from the launch pad.\u00a0 Tuesday\u2019s launch marked the fourth time the Musudan has been fired, with all attempts having ended in failure. About 50 Musudan missiles, believed to be based on the Soviet R-27 submarine-launched ballistic missile, have been deployed by the North since 2007. The missile is presumed to have maximum range of 4,000 kilometers, which would have put the U.S. military range in Guam within its striking range.But continued failures have raised questions about Pyongyang\u2019s missile capacity. On the coattails of Musudan\u2019s first failed launch last month, some military officials had speculated the communist state would not fire it again until it had figured out the technical issues that hindered the first launch. North Korea\u2019s missile launch follows its proposal for working-level military talks on May 20, which the South Korean government rejected, questioning its sincerity and saying that the hermit kingdom should first renounce its nuclear program.Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said that the missile launch is part of its two-track method of offering talks and showing force to pressure the international community. \u201cThe launch is (as much) aimed toward the U.S. and the international society as it is toward the South. The North appears to focus on improving its nuclear strike capacity by diversifying its means of launch,\u201d he said. Pyongyang in April held a test launch of its submarine-launched ballistic missile, which experts evaluated as a partial success in that it demonstrated the capacity for a submarine-based launch. \u201cImproving its nuclear strike capacity would have pressured the U.S. and the international society. I expect the North to continue its \u2018carrot and stick\u2019 approach,\u201d said Kim.In response to the North\u2019s recent long-range rocket and nuclear tests, the U.N. Security Council in March passed a resolution that includes the strongest economic sanctions against it to date. Pyongyang\u2019s sole major trading partner China, which had been faithful to the resolution, had suggested resuming talks in parallel to the sanctions.Ri Su-yong, vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party\u2019s Central Committee and the country\u2019s former foreign minister, made a surprise visit to China on Tuesday in what is seen as an attempt to mend ties between Beijing and Pyongyang.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","420":"Head of the newly-launched preparation committee for a foundation to be tasked with helping former comfort women said Tuesday that her focus will be placed on healing their scars and helping them recover their dignity.Kim Tae-hyun, an honorary professor at Sungshin Women's University, added that she and other members of the committee will be all ears to what they really want, believing that genuine communication starts with listening to what people want to say. \"I feel a heavy burden from taking on this important duty at such a sensitive time,\" Kim told reporters. \"But I could not reject the offer, as the time is running out, considering that the average age of the victims stands at 89.4 and many of them are suffering diseases.\"On Tuesday, the 11-member committee was officially launched to prepare the foundation designed to support South Korean women sexually enslaved by Japan during World War II.

Official sources said the launched missile was a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile.The sources said the missile may have exploded on the mobile launcher immediately after the fire button was pushed. They said the explosion is presumed to have inflicted serious injuries on personnel in the immediate vicinity. JCS spokesman Jeon Ha-kyu said in a press briefing that North Korea seems to be pushing for a continued string of ballistic missile launches following leader Kim Jong-un's orders for such tests to be carried out on March 15. \"The military is keeping open the possibility that the North will conduct additional provocations,\" he said.The latest launch marks Pyongyang's fourth failed attempt to launch its Musudan mid-range ballistic missiles in two months. On April 15, North Korea launched its first Musudan missile as the country was gearing up for a high-profile ruling party congress in early May. But the launch ended in failure, dealing a humiliating blow to North Korea. This was followed by Pyongyang firing off two more of the same IRBMs in a single day on April 28, although both of these launches failed too.North Korea has deployed about 50 Musudan missiles with its forces since 2007, but none of them had been test-fired until this year.The back-to-back launch failures stoked skepticism on the reliability of North Korea's Musudan missiles.Military officials had predicted for some time that North Korea would carry out additional ballistic missile launches or a nuclear detonation test to make up for its unsuccessful launch attempts in April. A day earlier, the JCS said it was closely tracking signs of a possible ballistic missile launch by North Korea following Japanese media reports on North Korea's launch preparations.

A group of academics, lawyers and human rights specialists at the Leiden Asia Center within Leiden University in the Netherlands has been delving into the practice of North Korean forced labor within the EU since last December. According to its preliminary findings, between 400 and 800 North Koreans are currently employed by at least 32 Polish firms, ranging from construction to shipbuilding. They work more than 12 hours a day, six days a week, while receiving \u201csignificantly lower wages\u201d than their local counterparts, the report said.\u00a0 A shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, where dozens of North Korean workers are employed. (Leiden Asia Centre)\u201cThis is if they even receive their wage at all. Mostly, managers collect the wages and workers in turn receive only a minimal livelihood allowance,\u201d the report said. Some of the companies were found to have received financial support from the European Regional Development Fund, which was bankrolled by the 28-nation bloc and overseen by the European Commission, thus potentially \u201cindirectly benefiting\u201d the Kim Jong-un regime, it noted. North Korean workers\u2019 payslip credit (Vice Media Germany)Among the firms are shipbuilders Crist and Nauta, which took out a 37.5 million-euro ($41.6 million) loan and sold two-year bonds worth around 40 million euros, respectively, as part of the ERD program in November 2009. The corporations may then be subject to U.N. sanctions imposed in March, which calls for an asset freeze of any person or entity \u201cengaging in, facilitating or being responsible for the exportation of workers\u201d from the North. During an inspection in 2013, the Polish National Labour Inspectorate discovered that 29 North Koreans were working illegally at Crist\u2019s shipyard. They were employed by Armex, a local recruiter that provides North Korean laborers to a number of Polish organizations, a practice that also violates Polish employment law. But the inspectorate concluded after further investigation that the North Korean workers are self-employed and thus outside of its jurisdiction. \u201cIn a situation with obvious insufficient control mechanisms, local employers continue to hire North Korean workers who work under extremely exploitative conditions,\u201d the report said.\u201cMy fear is that what we have uncovered so far is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Remco Breuker, a Korean studies professor at the school who led the research, said in a statement, noting that its complete report is expected to be published in early July. \u201cWe now want to examine whether the North Koreans move from one EU country to another to work there under some kind of lease system.\u201dFor the cash-strapped regime, overseas labor exports have long been a rare, coveted source of hard currency. A 2015 survey by the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea human rights alleged that more than 50,000 North Koreans are working abroad, pulling in collective annual incomes of between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion. Poland is deemed a major labor destination, having issued more than 430 work permits every year on average to North Koreans over the last six years, according to data from the Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Policy. The tally could be much higher if illegal laborers are taken into account.

(Yonhap)","431":"While ramping up global pressure is key to hampering Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear development, Seoul should chart a path to restart denuclearization talks to defuse tension and move toward an ultimate reunification, former New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Friday.\u201cThe crucial question is, what are the circumstances of starting dialogue? My observation is that it\u2019s always sooner rather than later,\u201d he told the Korea Herald in an interview on the sidelines of the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity on Jejudo Island. Former prime minister of New Zealand Jim Bolger (Ahn Hoon\/The Korea Herald)Bolger, 80, served as New Zealand\u2019s 35th prime minister from 1990 to 1997. He delivered a keynote speech and took part in a discussion with other former premiers on the forum\u2019s theme of \u201cAsia\u2019s new order and cooperative leadership\u201d on Thursday. He joined U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in expressing regret over the prolonged freezing of talks with Pyongyang. In his own address earlier, Ban stressed the need for a \u201cpath back to dialogue,\u201d while slamming the communist state\u2019s unabated nuclear ambitions.\u201cThere is no magical point where everything just happens. Every resolution to an issue like North Korea is proceeded by dialogue, discussion. That has to start sometime,\u201d Bolger said.\u201cFind the circumstances where you can start with small things. That would probably be the family issues between the two Koreas,\u201d he added, pointing to unification as the final destination.As a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, New Zealand is dedicated to shoring up international efforts to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, he noted.\u201cWe strongly support the additional sanctions that were imposed after the fourth nuclear test, and we will continue to work with other members in the international community in that space,\u201d he said.Highlighting the devastating effects of nuclear weapons, Bolger urged the U.S. and Russia -- which together possess over 95 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons today -- to swiftly reduce their nuclear stockpiles.The potential of nuclear devastation is increasing with the two countries spending trillions of dollars in upgrading their nuclear weapons, making them more effective yet damaging and dangerous, he said. \u201cThe world has to face (the fact) that this is not the way to go,\u201d Bolger said, noting that the world remains \u201cunsafe\u201d with atomic bombs and their possessors. \u201cThe only safe number of nuclear weapons is zero.\u201d On the economic front, the former prime minister also expressed high optimism for the future expansion of trade and other business ties between South Korea and New Zealand, lauding the free trade pact that took effect last December.South Korea could greatly benefit from New Zealand\u2019s expertise in agriculture while New Zealand could learn from Korea\u2019s advanced information technology and computing sectors through the agreement, among other positive outcomes, he said.\u201cNew Zealand\u2019s friendship with Korea has existed for long time, but having a free trade agreement I think adds depth to the relationship. I have confidence that we will deepen our relations much further,\u201d Bolger said. He also welcomed Seoul\u2019s joining of the International Antarctic Center in Christchurch, New Zealand last November, underlining the importance of scientific research there in responding to global warming.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the Antarctic is the key to knowing what will happen to the rest of the world (in terms of climate change),\u201d Bolger added. \u201cI look forward to New Zealand and Korea cooperating considerably in Antarctic research.\u201d By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","432":"Possible attacks by Pyongyang against South Korean citizens is causing local schools to cancel student excursions to the Mount Paekdu region, along the Sino-North Korean border, sources said Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0 Seoul's foreign ministry issued warnings that the North may be planning some kind of attack against South Koreans, which could include kidnapping.\u00a0\u00a0 The education ministry and the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education also sent official letters to all schools not to arrange trips to Mount Paekdu and nearby cities like Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province.\u00a0\u00a0 The mountain is held as sacred by all Koreans and is popular among South Korean tourists because it can be reached from the Chinese side of the border. Many visit the region because there are many historic landmarks of the Koguryo kingdom (37 B.C.-668 A.D.) that once ruled much of Manchuria. \u00a0\u00a0 Since the mass defection of North Korean restaurant workers from China in April, the government has been warning that the communist country may target South Korean citizens in reprisal.\u00a0\u00a0 The North claims that Seoul outright kidnapped or tricked the 13 restaurant staff members into defecting and warned repeatedly and publically that it will take revenge for the criminal act, although not going into details of what action it will take.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We had originally planned to go on a field trip to Mount Paekdu in July and August, but we are in the process of changing the destination,\" said a high school teacher at a private school in Songpa, in southwestern Seoul.\u00a0\u00a0 He said the school is getting feedback from students and parents on where to go.\u00a0\u00a0 The Seoul education office said some 50 schools sent students abroad last year, with most being private primary schools, as well as foreign language and specialized high schools. \u00a0\u00a0 \"If they go to China, they usually go to Beijing or Shanghai, although some do go to the Sino-North Korean border region,\" an insider said.\u00a0\u00a0 The official said all foreign trips must get permission from the local school commissioner and require at least 80 percent approval by parents. He, however, said school authorities will continue to remind schools of the dangers of traveling near the North Korean border. (Yonhap)","433":"South Korea and China have agreed to cooperate in infrastructure development in northeastern China, crucial for their policies of seeking closer economic ties between Asia and Europe, the finance ministry said Friday. At the 14th ministerial meeting held at a Seoul hotel, Strategy and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho suggested the joint infrastructure development project, and his Chinese counterpart Xu Shaoshi accepted the offer, the ministry said in a statement. \"The joint project is in line with the China-led 'One Belt, One Road' policy and the Eurasia initiative sought by Korea,\" Yoo said in an opening speech.The One Belt, One Road initiative refers to the latest economic development strategy unveiled by Beijing, which intends to build infrastructure and trade links between Asia and Europe. The Eurasia Initiative is a key part of Seoul's foreign policy agenda under which countries in Asia and Europe can draw closer together through increased economic cooperation.Under the agreement, the two countries will expand a logistics center in Hunchun, in the far eastern part of China, and upgrade the port of Jarubino in Russia. They will also build roads and railroads that connect the logistics center and the port, the statement said. The Hunchun logistics center was initially developed by POSCO and the Hyundai Group in a joint project. The two Korean companies have recently started a leasing business with the center, a ministry official said. \"The minister asked his counterpart to expand the Hunchun logistics center to accommodate a greater volume of the cargo coming from three provinces in northeast China -- Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang -- in a joint project,\" the official said. When it comes to Jarubino port development, China and Russia already signed an initial agreement, but they haven't entered into the project. Korea offered to help out with the port's extensive renovations. China welcomed the partnership with Korea in the two infrastructure projects, she said.The port of Jarubino is located near Hunchun in northeastern China. \"Currently, most of the cargo from the three northeastern provinces are being sent to a distant port in Dalian. If the cargo can be sent to the Jurubino port for export, it will help China and Korea cut their logistics costs,\" she explained.Meanwhile, the minister sought cooperation from China as Korea wants to host an annual meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank next year. The government has said the hosting of such an international event will contribute to improving Korea's status on the global stage and help its companies expand into global markets.

Since the early 1990s, local pharmaceutical firms have been making more efforts in R&D; activities to develop new drugs with in-house technology instead of relying on generic drugs.It took nearly a decade for SK Chemicals to develop the landmark anti-cancer drug, indicating the difficulty of creating a new drug without borrowing overseas technology. The latest data shows that local pharmaceutical companies have been increasing expenditures on their R&D; projects in an apparent bid to foster new growth engines.A total of 96 listed local drug firms spent 1.16 trillion won ($984 million) on R&D; last year, a 12.4 percent increase from a year ago, the KHID data showed.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","435":"Two North Korean vessels crossed the de facto western maritime border Friday amid heightened tensions in inter-Korean relations, Seoul's military said.The Navy fired warning shots at the North Korean vessels -- a fishing boat and a patrol boat -- as they trespassed across the maritime border in the Yellow Sea, widely known as the Northern Limit Line, at around 7:30 a.m, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They returned to the northern side immediately after the warning shots were fired, it added.

Meanwhile, the largest proportion of the Chinese patients, 24 percent of them, visited Korea for cosmetic surgeries and treatments. Also, 28 percent of Russian patients, and 23 percent of those from the U.S., sought treatment at internal medicine clinics.

The ruling party members of both countries held talks on Monday to discuss ways to further develop their friendly ties.During Kim's meeting with Castro, the North Korean official appreciated the Cuban government's efforts to adhere to socialist principles and to achieve big successes in building socialism, the media outlet reported.Raul Castro, in turn, congratulated the North's WPK on its successful 7th Congress, saying, \"It is the firm stand of the party and government of Cuba to further develop friendly and cooperative relations with North Korea.\" (Yonhap)","439":"A high-profile South Korean gay couple said Thursday they will appeal a recent court's rejection to legally recognize their marriage.Kim Jho Gwang-soo and Kim Sung-hwan tied the knot in September 2013 but are still seeking to get legal status.They submitted a report of marriage to a Seoul district office, but it was denied by the office on the grounds that \"same-sex marriage does not satisfy the definition of husband and wife in civil law.\" They made an appeal in May 2014, asking the court to rule on the case.The Seoul Western District Court ruled against the filmmaker couple Wednesday, saying same sex-marriage cannot be recognized as legitimate under the country's current legal system. The court said a separate legislative step is needed to recognize same-sex unions as a marriage.\"I don't understand why we have to be marginalized from the existing system just because we have the same sex,\" Kim said. \"I hope the judiciary takes courage and makes a decision, instead of pushing the responsibility to the legislative body.\"Their legal representatives said two more same-sex couples will file separate suits later in the day, seeking legal status for their marriages.

Kang's remarks came in the wake of the murder of the 23-year-old woman by a 34-year-old man with a knife at a bathroom in a building near the crowded Gangnam subway station last Tuesday.He had no personal acquaintance with her before the murder.During a police probe, the suspect is known to have testified that he committed the crime out of hatred toward women as he had always been ignored by them. The case immediately sparked off a large-scale campaign against sex discrimination among young people, although police later said that the homicide seems to have been committed due to his mental illness. (Yonhap)","441":"U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday urged a return to talks with North Korea despite its defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons.Ban, who is on a six-day visit to his native South Korea, made the call during a forum on the southern resort island of Jeju, saying the tensions on the Korean Peninsula are \"one of the great challenges to global action and regional cooperation.\"\"Rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula could cast a shadow across Northeast Asia and beyond,\" he said in a keynote address at the opening of the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity. \"I welcome efforts to move forward, and I stand ready as the secretary-general of the United Nations and also personally to contribute in any way that might be helpful.\"Plans by the U.N. chief to visit North Korea last year fell through after Pyongyang abruptly withdrew its invitation.\"We must find the path back to dialogue,\" Ban said.Pyongyang has recently made a series of proposals for talks with Seoul, but the South Korean government has rejected them, saying the North is not serious about denuclearization.\"Good relations between the two Koreas are essential for lasting peace not only on the Korean Peninsula but throughout the region,\" the secretary-general said.Ban's first visit home in a year has drawn keen attention amid growing speculation he may run for the presidency next year. His second five-year term as U.N. chief ends in December.On Wednesday, he left open the possibility of a presidential bid, saying he will contemplate his future as a South Korean citizen upon completing his tenure at the U.N.He also expressed an eagerness to engage with the North, claiming to be the only one to maintain an inter-Korean dialogue channel.\"Even as we keep pressure on the North, there must be efforts to hold talks and ease tensions through humanitarian issues,\" he said during a meeting with senior journalists Wednesday.Ban's seeming departure from Seoul's official policy line on Pyongyang has fueled speculation over his presidential ambitions, with observers noting that the former South Korean foreign minister may be building a platform for his future campaign.Since his arrival Wednesday, the U.N. chief has met with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo and leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party on the forum's sidelines.On North Korea, Ban was still firm on its nuclear program and human rights record.\"Military spending remains high, while children are wasting.Human rights are systematically abused,\" he said. \"The authorities of the DPRK must correct these wrongs.\"DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.North Korea was slapped with toughened sanctions in March under a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted in response to its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch a month later.\"I encourage the DPRK to cease any further provocations and return to full compliance with international obligations,\" Ban said.Urging the international community to \"hold on a firm line\" on North Korea, he also expressed hope the U.N. resolution's full implementation would lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.After making a short trip to Japan later in the day to attend a G7 summit, Ban will be back late Friday to attend the Rotary International Convention in Goyang, just outside of Seoul, and visit the ruling party stronghold of Gyeongsang to tour a UNESCO-listed folk village and open a U.N. conference.

The man, identified only by his surname Kim, was arrested by police later in the day.Kim waited for about 40 minutes for a woman to show up at the building, according to the police. When the victim, whose identity was withheld, came into the unisex restroom, Kim attacked her with a knife he had brought.During the police investigation, Kim said he had always been \"ignored\" by women.As he was escorted to the prosecutors' office, Kim told reporters he feels sorry about the victim who lost her life at a young age. Police earlier concluded that the murder was based on Kim's mental disease.Kim has a record of being hospitalized for schizophrenia a total of four times since 2008. Since he left the hospital for the last time in January, he has not taken his medication properly, according to police.Kim has been living on the streets since March.The case has sparked a nationwide debate over violence against women in the country. Police, however, declined to define it as a hate crime against women.\"We are not at a position to declare our stance regarding whether it was a hate crime against women,\" said Han Jeung-sub, the police officer in charge of the investigation.Kim Soo-nam, the country's top prosecutor, ordered officials to thoroughly investigate the motive and details of the incident and prepare measures to prevent any similar cases from occurring, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office said.Police, meanwhile, said they will continue providing psychological therapy and financial support to the bereaved family.

But we're not focused on China,\" Kerry said, according to a White House transcript. \"I just can't say it enough. We're focused on this region. And I think the primary threat of the entire region is North Korea, Kim Jong-un and the proliferation activities of the DPRK. That's the primary threat.

The current law limits such calls to cases related to law revisions or state audits.The expanded Assembly authority has been pushed by the opposition camp which, as a result of the April 13 general election, has come to account for a parliamentary majority in the incoming term.The bill was handed over to the presidential office on Monday for final approval, a process during which the president may wield the constitutional right of veto.

It was renamed the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity in 2011, and has since evolved to include insights from business, technology, environment, women, education and culture sectors, in addition to discussing political and diplomatic issues.For one, the 2012 Jeju Forum invited Steve Wozniak, cofounder of U.S. tech giant Apple, to discuss the end of the personalized computer era and the future of the Internet technology industry, alongside political leaders such as Australia\u2019s former Prime Minister Paul Keating and secretary general of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Lamberto Zannier, among others.In 2013, Quantum Fund cofounder Jim Rogers, a legendary figure in the world of investment and trading, shared his insights on investing in a post-financial crisis economy.

Moon Jae-in and key lawmakers including former Prime Minister Rep. Lee Hae-chan.The Saenuri was represented by its floor leader Chung Jin-suk and floor spokesperson Min Kyung-wook.

Lee, a 48-year-old Korean-American who currently heads Google Korea, is suspected of not taking appropriate measures despite rising health complaints from users when he was leading the company from June 2005 to May 2010. Sales of Oxy Ssak Ssak reached a high during his term. Former CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser John Lee (center) appears for questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office on Monday. Yonhap\u201c(The case) is very heartbreaking,\u201d Lee said in Korean as he appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office. \u201cMy prayers and condolences go out to the victims and the families. I will cooperate with the investigation,\u201d he added in English. Lee is the first foreign national to be questioned as a suspect in the sterilizer case that has resulted in at least 146 deaths recognized by the government. Last week, prosecutors questioned Ulrich Hosterbach, a finance director of Oxy \u2013 currently Reckitt Benckiser Korea \u2013 as a witness.The prosecution questioned Lee on whether he had known about the harmfulness of the product and the reasons for failing to take measures despite the health complaints. They also looked into what and how much of a role the U.K. headquarters played in decision-making over the product. The U.K. headquarters owns 100 percent of the Korean subsidiary.The investigators said they will decide on the charges against Lee based on the evidence and questioning. The prosecution also called in two officials each from Lotte Mart and Homeplus, who were in charge of developing their own humidifier disinfectant brands.Meanwhile, a group of victims and their families filed complaints with the prosecutors against 18 public officials for accidental manslaughter for neglecting their duties to ensure product safety. The accused include two former environment ministers -- Kim Myung-ja who served from 1999 to 2003 and Kang Hyun-wook who served from 1996 to 1997 --\u00a0 and other Environment Ministry officials. They were in charge of the country\u2019s chemical safety rules and giving permits to manufacturers for the use of PGH and PHMG, which were used in the toxic humidifier disinfectants. \u201c(The accused) allowed the use of the toxic chemical without fully reviewing the toxicity according to the regulations. Even after the toxicity was confirmed, the (ministry) neglected the disinfectant users, leading to more deaths and injury,\u201d said attorney Ha Joo-hee, who works as one of legal representatives for the group. \u201cThey violated their duties, not only morally but also legally. For the disinfectant toxicity review, the ministry did not receive any data about the inhalation-toxicity test, although the ministry was supposed to do so.\u201dUnder the rule, the general use and specific use of chemicals should be submitted to the ministry for toxicity review. For chemicals used in products related to inhalation, companies must submit additional safety test data. PHMG was first developed by a local company in 1996 and registered as an antimicrobial agent\u00a0for carpets. In the U.S., the chemical has been classified as an agricultural pesticide. The victims argued that the ministry did not thoroughly review the chemicals\u2019 toxicity and did not ask the company for a inhalation-toxicity test, however, the ministry has claimed that reviewing the chemical's inhalation toxicity was not necessary as the harmfulness of PHMG was low as long as it is used as a carpet treatment. PHG was also registered as an antimicrobial treatment\u00a0for rubber, woods and fabrics, based on which it did not require an inhalation-toxicity test. The ministry did not comment on the complaint filed by the victims.

If a policyholder killed himself two years after he bought the policy, the life insurer has to deliver insurance benefits to his bereaved families without fail,\" an FSS official said.In a case of suicide by depression or other mental illness, life insurers also have to pay insurance money to the bereaved families of those who take their own lives. In this case, the insurers have to deliver the money regardless of the length of the policy-holding period, he said.\"Insurance terms previously stipulated that insurance money should be paid in case of suicide two years after the purchase of the policy, or for a suicide resulting from a mental disorder,\" said the official. \"If insurers delay or refuse the payment of all suicide insurance money, they may face a probe (by the FSS) into their past payments of insurance money to customers.\"From March 2015, the family of a policyholder who kills himself is required to apply for the suicide insurance money within three years of the suicide. The period was extended by one year from the previous two years, the FSS said. Suicide-related insurance payments amount to 80 million won ($68,000) on average per case, it said.In fact, unclear insurance terms have caused conflicts between insurance companies and clients, particularly when it comes to policies which cover suicides and deaths caused by disasters.For years, Korea has had a high suicide rate. Data released in August last year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that an average of 29.1 people per 100,000 here took their own lives, compared with an average of 12 for other OECD member states.

The $20 million water project continued until criticism emerged from the international community that the aid could be diverted to programs of weapons of massive destruction. As a country with a population of just 4.2 million with consistent geopolitical risks and threats, foreign affairs have played a large part in helping Kuwait fend off the invasion of regional powers and maintaining economic and political prosperity.Ever since Kuwait was liberated from the annexation of Iraq by the coalition forces of 34 nations led by the United States, the nation has beefed up its efforts to enhance multilateral ties by playing a mediating role in regional and international disputes. One of those initiative is hosting a pledging conference for Syria, which has been ravaged by the civil war that has left more than hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced. Since 2013, Kuwait has hosted the event and donated $120 million by 2015 to help the refugee.

The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said in a press briefing that the killing by the 34-year-old man, only identified by his surname Kim, was a typical crime committed by the mentally disturbed.Kim was arrested last week on suspicion of stabbing the woman to death at a public bathroom near Gangnam Subway Station on May 17. He allegedly waited until other six men left the toilet and killed the first woman who entered, according to CCTV footage.Sergeant Lee Sang-gyeong of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency speaks during a press briefing at Seocho Police Station in Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)The suspect, who had no prior contact with the victim, told police that he had committed the crime because he had been \u201cbelittled\u201d by women many times in the past. Police pointed out that killing the first woman Kim saw in the toilet meant that his crime was neither planned in advance nor systematic.\u201cThere is a need to distinguish between hate crimes and crimes driven by mental illness. The latest case falls in the latter category,\u201d the police said in a press briefing. \u201cHate crime arises from prejudice on a certain group, while mental illness-driven crimes are usually committed due to symptoms such as delusional thoughts and auditory hallucination.\u201d After police profilers had hours-long interviews with Kim on two occasions, they concluded that the crime was \u201caccidental\u201d as the suspect had no direct cause to murder the victim and his symptom of schizophrenia had deteriorated at the time of the crime.According to the police, Kim, who was an only child, has lived alone without interacting with his family. He used to work with women at a restaurant as a waiter, but had to move to the kitchen for his personal hygiene problems, which Kim claimed was due to his female colleagues badmouthing him.He allegedly told the police that he could not stand mistreatment by women anymore and had to kill them before he got killed. Since 2008, he has shown abnormal behavior such as not having a shower for over a year, sleeping on the streets or smashing the front door of his house without being aware of his mental illness, police said. Kim was hospitalized for schizophrenia six times since 2008. But he never took medication since he was discharged from the hospital in January, which police claimed might have prompted him to commit the crime. In Korea, there are an estimated 500,000 patients suffering from schizophrenia, but only 104,000 visited hospitals for treatment. According to prosecutors\u2019 data, 36 percent of impulsive crimes between 2012 and 2015 were committed by those with mental illness, followed by alcohol and drug addiction at 36 percent and dissatisfaction with reality at 24 percent. As part of efforts to prevent crimes by the mentally ill, the police has been granted more authority to order the mentally disturbed to be admitted to hospitals when they detect any abnormal behavior. The revision to the mental health act passed at the National Assembly last week despite lingering concerns over possible human rights violations by authorities on the mentally ill. The police conclusion on the nature of the crime, however, sparked further public outcry and concerns among experts and Koreans who continued to mourn the death of the young woman at a makeshift shrine outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday afternoon. Participants attend a tribute march for the victim of the Gangnam murder on Saturday. (Yonhap)\u201cIt is impossible to define the cause of crime as either mental problem or hatred against women. Many experts should come together to study his mental problem more in-depth,\u201d a lawyer Go Ji-woon from Gamdong law firm told The Korea Herald. \u201cDespite his mental illness, he might have unconsciously developed hatred against women.

There were also people -- many of them young women -- looking visibly shocked and grief-stricken, with their eyes glued to the pastel-colored post-its filled with heartbreaking messages.\u201cNo one should die just because she is a woman,\u201d read one of the messages. \u201cI know I could\u2019ve been you, you could\u2019ve been me,\u201d said another. The flowers and messages were left as tributes for the 23-year-old woman who had been stabbed to death the night before in the public bathroom of a four-story building near Gangnam Station. Visitors pay tribute to a 23-year-old woman in an alleged hate crime, near exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The 34-year-old murder suspect, with whom the victim allegedly had no prior contact, told the police he committed the crime because he had been \u201cbelittled by women\u201d many times in the past. Security footage showed the man wandering around the building and entering the bathroom a few minutes before the victim. Police said Thursday that the man is believed to be schizophrenic, having been hospitalized multiple times before.The idea to leave tributes to the late victim at the nearby subway station was initiated by two online communities for women, who created a Twitter account on Wednesday morning. The account handle is @0517am1, in reference to the day and time the victim lost her life. \u201cA young woman who was just having drinks with her friends was stabbed to death only because she went to the public bathroom (in the same building) in the middle of the gathering,\u201d one of the tweets said, asking the public to support the cause. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything about this case, then the next victim could be any one of us.\u201dCho Su-min, a 23-year-old woman, said she came to the site after learning about the case via Twitter. \u201cI feel scared and powerless,\u201d she told The Korea Herald. \u201cBut I feel this is the least I can do. It\u2019s especially devastating because I\u2019ve been thinking that among all areas in Seoul, Gangnam is one of the safer areas.\u201dWith shock over the case growing, the police on Thursday said that it should not be perceived as a misogynist crime.\u201cAs the suspect is suffering from a serious level of schizophrenia, it is difficult to view the motive as hatred toward women,\u201d the Seocho Police Station said. They said a profiler was interviewing the man.But shadows of discrimination and misogyny have lingered over the case. Some of those who left tributes at the subway station also attached to their messages printed-out responses that others had had toward news reports on the murder. \u201cUgly Korean women can relax,\u201d said one of them. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to touch you so stop worrying and use the public bathrooms as much as you need.\u201dSome said the motive of the murder is no longer the main point.Kim Ha-ram and Kang Min-kyung, both 30, said they had come to see the tributes after being enraged by several media reports on the case. For instance, one of the major dailies here published a report with the headline: \u201cTheology student who dreamed of becoming pastor commits impulsive murder.\u201d It also reported that the suspect was often \u201cmistreated\u201d by a number of women while working at a church. \u201cI thought (the headline) was the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d said Kim. \u201cWhy do we even need to know that about the suspect? Why does it even matter that he studied theology? What about the late victim and the dreams and goals she may have had? The report almost sounded as if the suspect\u2019s future was ruined because of the victim.\u201dKang added that the news reports were problematic because they seemed to indirectly blame women for the suspect\u2019s crime. \u201cInstead of saying he did it because he was \u2018mistreated\u2019 by women, the reports should have said that he had issues with his confidence. Being mistreated by the opposite gender does not justify murder.\u201dMost of those who left flowers for the victim purchased them from Songrim Flowers, a flower shop minutes away from exit 10 of Gangnam Station.\u201cPeople have been coming in since 8 a.m. to pay tribute. I think we\u2019ve received more than 100 people so far,\u201d said Kim Song-rim, a 70-year-old florist who has run the shop for 30 years. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in this district for a long time, and Gangnam has always been filled with young people. It\u2019s heartbreaking to learn that something so terrible has happened in this area.\u201dStatistics show that violence against women, especially in the context of dating or courtship, is prevalent in South Korea. According to a 2014 study by Lee Hwa-young from Korea Women\u2019s Hot Line, up to 50 percent of Korean women have been physically abused by their romantic partners at least once in their lives. The study also showed that almost 90 percent of the surveyed women said they had either been physically or emotionally abused by their partners or boyfriends. Last year, a man in his 20s was criminally charged after it was revealed that he murdered his girlfriend shortly after she tried to break up with him, then secretly buried her body. Voyeuristic sexual crimes against women, such as taking pictures of body parts in public spaces, also increased dramatically here from 2005-14.A survey released in March by the Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute had shown that more than half of South Korean men do not object to expressions such as \u201cKimchinyeo\u201d and \u201cDoenjangnyeo,\u201d which describe \u201cmaterialistic Korean women.\u201d Such terms, which are considered derogatory to women, are widely used on social media and other platforms. A 28-year-old woman, who only wanted to be identified by her surname Lee, learned about the murder case on Wednesday morning -- shortly after being sexually harassed by a man at Gangnam Station. The man ran away when Lee tried to confront him. \u201cI was really angry so I called my friend to talk about it,\u201d she told The Korea Herald. \u201cI told her that I wish I had at least had the chance to curse at him. That\u2019s when my friend told me about the murder case and said, \u2018I think it\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t. Who knows what could\u2019ve happened to you if you did (curse at him)?\u2019\u201dLee said that her friend\u2019s advice reflects the reality of Korean society in that many female victims of violence are blamed for what happened to them. Common examples of shaming victims include blaming them for \u201cbeing too drunk\u201d or \u201changing out late at night,\u201d or even saying \u201cthey should have known better.\u201d Even the Gender Ministry\u2019s campaign ad against sexual harassment last year encouraged women not to wear miniskirts when riding the subway.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt that being a woman in Korea is so hard until today,\u201d she said.Lee left a tribute to the recent victim on two post-it notes. She decided to write two sentences in German after observing that others had written in different languages. They said: \u201cWeil sie eine Frau ist (Because she is a woman)\u201d and \u201cWeil wir Frauen sind (Because we are women).\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","469":"Recent satellite imagery shows camouflage netting over the deck of North Korea's ballistic missile submarine in an indication that the communist nation is forging ahead with its SLBM development, a U.S. website monitoring the North said Tuesday.The May 8 imagery of the Sinpo South Shipyard shows netting has been suspended over the Gorae-class submarine in an sign that the North is continuing to \"actively pursue development of both a ballistic missile submarine and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM),\" the website 38 North said.\"This netting was first seen in imagery of December 26, 2015 and on several occasions since.

The upcoming submission, which is scheduled to be made in the second half of this year, seeks to be recognized by the Korean Drug Ministry as \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis\u201d \u2013 or PrEP \u2013 a preventive medicine for those who do not have HIV or AIDS.\u201cWe think we\u2019ll get our response from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety sometime next year, probably after June,\u201d an official from Gilead Sciences told The Korea Herald. \u201cOnce we get the ministry\u2019s approval, we can officially label the drug as PrEP.\u201dIn Korea, the drug is currently mostly prescribed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS patients. For prevention, the drug is only prescribed to health care workers, newborns born to HIV-positive parents, men and women who are legally married to patients infected with HIV or AIDS, including those in common-law marriages.\u00a0 Gay marriage is not legally recognized in Korea.YonhapUnder the current system in Korea, men who have sex with men -- who are known to be 19 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population,\u00a0 according to UNAIDS, the joint U.N. program on HIV and AIDs -- do not have access to the drug for prevention. An industry source who did not wish to be named said although it is more likely that more Koreans would gain access to the drug once Truvada is approved as PrEP, it is currently difficult to predict what is going to happen. \u201cA lot of sensitive issues, such as LGBT rights and possible stigmatization, are involved with the use of this drug as a preventive medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, there may be a possible stigma against those who prescribe the drug for preventive purposes. There\u2019s also the issue of privacy and how we are going to protect the relevant personal data.\u201d In the U.S., Truvada was approved as PrEP by the FDA back in 2012. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S., daily PrEP use can lower the risk of getting HIV and AIDS from sex by more than 90 percent. PrEP, however, does not work in the same way as a vaccine. Unlike a vaccine that teaches one\u2019s body to fight off infection for several years, PrEP, which come in the form of pills, is required to be taken orally every day. The presence of the medicine in one\u2019s bloodstream is known to stop HIV from spreading in the body.The cost of the drug is currently covered by the Korea\u2019s National Health Insurance for HIV and AIDS patients.

The steel cutting ceremony for the vessel was held in November 2014.Daewoo had also built the Navy\u2019s 209-class Jangbogo-I and won a maintenance contract for the submarines, according to the company\u2019s officials on Tuesday.South Korean Navy\u2019s 209-class submarine \/ Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co.Jangbogo-III, named after the legendary admiral during the ancient Korean dynasty of Silla, will be the first 3,000-ton submarine operated by the Navy. The largest submarine currently in use is the 1,800-ton 214-class submarine, the most recent of which was launched last year.The new submarine will be equipped with six vertical launching systems capable of firing ballistic missiles. The navy will reportedly equip the Hyunmoo-2B surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a range of 500 kilometers and payload of 500 kilograms.Acquisition of the 3,000-ton submarine has garnered attention here in light of North Korea\u2019s test-firing of a submarine launched ballistic missile last month. The Defense Ministry said the launch demonstrated some level of progress in the North\u2019s SLBM program, including an underground ejection of the projectile.Seoul\u2019s official position on the expected deployment of the SLBM is that it will take three to four years. But officials have said it may take less time if the communist country concentrates unconventionally large amounts of resources into the project, which hinges on the will of its leader Kim Jong-un.A military official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said that North Korea is believed to be developing a 3,000-ton submarine that will equip multiple SLBMs. The currently used 2,000-ton Sinpo-class can only equip one ballistic missile.\u201cBeing a dictatorial state that operates under orders from Kim, we can\u2019t accurately predict how much time it will take to launch (the 3,000-ton submarine),\u201d the official said.North Korean navy is currently thought to have over 80 submarines, far outnumbering the 14 operated by the South.But its larger submarines are mostly comprised of the 1,800-ton Romeo-class submarine, and the Pyongyang-operated Romeo-class submarines are reportedly designed without considering the equipment of ballistic missiles.Pyongyang is believed to have one Sinpo-class submarine that was influenced by the designs of the Russian-built Golf-class it brought in the 1990s.In a 2015 report, the Research Institute for National Security Affairs said that technical difficulties would hinder the North from equipping SLBM on a Romeo-class. It added that a new vessel influenced by a more modern Golf-class would be able to equip the SLBM.There have been calls that the South should develop asymmetric military capabilities by powering the new Jangbogo-III -- at least from batch-2 -- with a nuclear reactor.Moon Geun-shik, a defense analyst at the Korea Defense and Security Forum, stressed that the strategic values of a nuclear-powered submarine far outweighs vessels that have diesel engines. He warned that absence of a nuclear-powered vessel would mean that South Korean continues relying heavily on the U.S. for anti-submarine operations. By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","473":"North Korea made a concerted effort to build up the personality cult of its leader Kim Jong-un through literary and artistic works ahead of the recently closed congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, an examination of North Korean media reports showed Tuesday.In media reports released last week, the North's Korean Central News Agency said the country's youth and students created some 1,200 literary works during the 70-day campaign of loyalty that preceded the four-day party congress that ended on May 9.Local North Korean watchers who checked the reclusive country's media said moves to idolize Kim, who has been in power since late 2011, sped up ahead of the landmark event. They said such actions are in line with the country's past practice of making its leader into a glorified being. Kim was named the new chairman of the WPK at the congress.Pyongyang already completed a 70-day campaign of loyalty, a scheme to mobilize its people to work harder on state construction and other projects. According to the KCNA report, a lot of literary works related to the North Korean leader were produced by young people.For example, the news agency claimed a youth group called the Paektusan Hero Youth Stormers released a literary production named \"We are the heroes of youth powerful country\" in which many literary works praised the North Korean leader with \"great honor and deep trust from the people.\"In the literary works, university students across the country pledged to become heroes of the country to create miracles on their way to constructing a powerful socialist state by uniting around leader Kim Jong-un.Another North Korean media outlet, Airang-Meari, claimed on May 5 that a theatrical play was produced glorifying Kim Jong-un. The play was titled \"Hyolmaek,\" or blood vessel, and was produced by the North's state theatrical troupe. It showed the \"honorable Marshal Kim Jong-un's sublime will for the construction of a great prosperous country on the ground.\"In addition, the North's Central TV Station introduced an epic poem idolizing Kim Jong-un as well as his grandfather Kim Il-sung and his late father Kim Jong-il.The poetry was introduced on the opening day of the WPK congress on May 6 in a move to elevate Kim Jong-un to the level of his two predecessors.In his report to the party congress, Kim Jong-un urged the nation to create literary and artistic works to glorify the great revolutionary history and immortal achievements of the deceased leaders. (Yonhap)","474":"The U.S. State Department on Monday issued the latest warning against traveling to North Korea, saying foreign visitors to the communist nation could end up behind bars for actions not considered crimes elsewhere.\"The State Department strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to North Korea due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement, which imposes unduly harsh sentences, including for actions that in the United States would not be considered crimes,\" the warning said.\"At least 14 U.S. citizens have been detained in the DPRK in the past ten years. North Korea has detained those who traveled independently and those who were part of organized tours,\" it said, referring to the North by its official name.Visitors should have \"no expectation of privacy\" in the North, the warning said, adding that all electronic and multimedia devices including USB drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, Internet browsing histories and cookies are subject to search for banned content.\"Possession of any media, either physical or electronic, criticizing the DPRK government or its leaders is considered a criminal act punishable by long-term detention in hard labor camps and heavy fines,\" it said.The warning included examples of acts punished in the North, including showing disrespect to the country's former and current leaders, proselytizing or carrying out religious activities, having unauthorized interaction with the local population and taking unauthorized photographs.\"Numerous foreigners have been held in North Korea for extended periods of time without being formally charged with any crimes,\" it said. \"Detained foreigners have been questioned daily for several weeks without the presence of counsel and have been compelled to make public statements and take part in public trials.\"Two American citizens are currently held in North Korea, including university student Otto Warmbier, sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for stealing a political propaganda sign, and Korean-American Kim Dong-chu,l convicted of trying to steal classified military information.\u00a0State Department spokesman John Kirby said the department usually updates such travel warnings every six months, but the warning for North Korea will be updated every 90 days under the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 that was enacted earlier this year.\"I think that's reflective of the increased tensions that we're seeing there on the peninsula and certainly the manner in which the regime has acted out against foreigners on travel to North Korea,\" Kirby said \"So we take our responsibilities very seriously to travelers so that we give them as much information as we can before they travel.\" (Yonhap)","475":"GURAGE\/KITENGELA, Ethiopia\/Kenya -- Fatima Surel, 30, walks four hours twice daily to get water, carrying her 2-year-old son Fuad on her back far away from her small village in Adoshe, some 170 kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa. Yet the water that filled her two 1-gallon (3.8 liters) bottles was barely transparent, tainted with red clay, dirt and other indiscernible substances. She knows the water cannot be safe, but it is the only source she can access. \u201cIt\u2019s really heavy to carry these, and because of the long distance, I can only carry a little,\u201d said Surel, a mother of three boys, the others aged 3 and 5. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to get water but I just fetch whatever I can in this area because I need it for drinking, washing my children and other household chores.\u201d Fatima Surel (center), a 30-year-old resident in the southwestern town of Adoshe, and other villagers pose after obtaining water from a stream on May 3 in Gurage Zone, Ethiopia. (Shin Hyon-hee\/The Korea Herald)Like her, the majority of families in the Gurage Zone face the pressing daily challenge of water shortage and unclean water that results in diarrhea and other waterborne epidemics. As of 2015, around 57 percent of the Ethiopian population has access to safe water, according to KOICA. The figure is a mere 49 percent for those living in rural regions, whereas 93 percent of urbanites enjoy clean water. Some 413,000 Ethiopians die every year from diarrhea. It is the fifth highest driver of deaths among children under 5. \u201cThere\u2019re no other springs in this area. People who drink this water usually get sick and (it) even causes death because it contains bacteria and other harmful substances,\u201d said Feyesel Zenu, a 28-year-old Adoshe villager.\u00a0 To help tackle the issue and improve the residents\u2019 health conditions, the Korea International Cooperation Agency set out in 2013 to lay water pipelines totaling 170 kilometers and install 190 supply facilities at places such as public health centers and schools in Gurage.\u00a0 The $8.4 million program is expected to benefit 73,000 residents in two countries once completed in the latter half of next year. Pipeline construction is currently under way by Kunhwa Consulting & Engineering Co., a Seoul-headquartered builder. To ensure water quality, the agency is also carrying out a separate campaign to help villagers build new toilets and provide sanitation education. About 70 percent of households have a toilet at home, but half of them are merely a shallow hole in their backyards without any partition or even a lid, said Kwon Hyun-jin, the program manager and a researcher of the Seoul-based Re-shaping Development Institute. \u201cThere is a sufficient amount of water around the catchment basin, but the problem lies with the management of water quality and poor supply system,\u201d she said. \u201cIn rainy seasons, runoff occurs everywhere, contaminating water, and flies breed among waste material. These have been the main causes of diarrhea and other (potentially) fatal waterborne diseases.\u201d Alongside the project, KOICA is conducting another parallel experiment to assess the impact of water access on the outbreak of diarrhea among children under 5. It targets a total of 48 small villages, half of them serving as a control group. The results will also be published in the peer-reviewed journal Trials, according to Doh Young-ah, the country director of the grant agency\u2019s Ethiopia office. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a variety of people who became sick from water and died. Thanks to KOICA\u2019s efforts, we\u2019re optimistic and excited to wait for the results from drinking clean water,\u201d said Sheriadin Awol, 70, an elder of the village of Ambrte. Heiru Shifa, head of the Gurage Zone\u2019s water mines and energy department, noted that around 40 percent of the region\u2019s residents take more than one hour to reach a water spring, with some walking as far as 7 kilometers. \u201cFemale family members are often tasked with the job so girls often miss classes and even drop out of school. And it also affects the overall household productivity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the work is completed, the water will be managed by the people themselves, for which we plan to create a user association and write a manual.\u201d Medical support in Kenya As part of efforts to shore up public health in East Africa, KOICA built a hospital in Kitengela, Kenya in 2010. The project was initiated in 2008 following the Kenyan government\u2019s request to help meet growing needs for medical services in the city of 680,000, about 50 kilometers away from capital Nairobi. By the national average, one doctor is responsible for about 25,000, whereas a Kitengela surgeon is in charge of some 76,000, Kenya 2010 official data shows.\u00a0 Salome Aluso, 20, poses with her newborn baby at the Kitengela Sub-county Hospital built in Kajiado, Kenya, by the Korea International Cooperation Agency.(Shin Hyon-hee\/The Korea Herald)\u201cOne of the biggest problems we\u2019ve found is that it\u2019s not easy to run hospitals effectively if you do not have qualified, well-trained staff. So the workload at some hospitals is very high,\u201d said David Ole Nkedianye, governor of Kajiado County. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough doctors, and they take a lot to train but you cannot hire that many because of budget constraints. And we also need more equipment like vehicles and CT scans so we do not send them to Nairobi.\u201dDuring a visit on April 27, the Kitengela Sub-county Hospital was brimming with patients awaiting treatment and checkups. More than 250 residents visit the hospital\u2019s nine departments daily, including pediatrics, obstetrics and dentistry, all of which are armed with modern equipment, operating rooms and incubators, officials said. Salome Aluso, 20, gave birth to twins at a private hospital but one of her babies fell ill there. \u201cI went to another hospital but the fevers were not coming down. I arrived here six days ago, my boy is now doing well,\u201d she said. Eunice Nelima, 18, came to the hospital after giving birth to a boy at a different hospital and developing an infection there. \u201cMy caretaker sent me somewhere else at first but I was not getting better. But I moved here two months ago and am doing fine, and last week\u2019s surgery went well,\u201d she said.Staff there called the institution the \u201cbest in county,\u201d performing far better than the other four major public hospitals. Medical expenses are a fraction of what private hospitals charge. The facility\u2019s status was elevated by one notch to sub-county hospital only two years after KOICA handed it over to the Kajiado county government in 2011. Its workforce also more than doubled to 96 last year from the previous 42. From the latter half of this year, the hospital plans to operate mobile clinics with the support of KOICA to provide services to patients in distant regions and bring those in need of further treatment. \u201cAll age groups come here, but mostly females and children. Among the common diseases are respiratory symptoms and diarrhea, and HIV is very high as well as malnutrition,\u201d said Opiyo Kennedy Odhiambo, a general doctor and medical superintendent of the hospital who has recently applied to study public health policy at Hanyang University in Seoul. \u201cIn terms of the public health system and policy, there are definitely some areas for improvement. Public health involves various stakeholders, so I\u2019d like to contribute to developing our policy and change our system.\u201d By Shin Hyon-hee(heeshin@heraldcorp.com) Korea Herald Correspondent","476":"The prosecution said Monday it has found additional evidence to prove that Oxy Reckitt Benckiser sold its problematic humidifier disinfectant in the market while being aware of its ingredient toxicity, based on a state report made four years ago. Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office said they had found the Korea Fair Trade Commission\u2019s chemicals labeling report which showed that the company \u2013 now formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea -- had received material safety data sheets (MSDS) on PHMG from ingredient providers, which had specified that PHMG should not be eaten or inhaled by humans. The exact date of when the MSDS was exchanged remains undisclosed.The MSDS is a mandatory document submitted when trading chemicals. Hence, this indicates that the company had known of the toxic chemical, despite Oxy\u2019s claim that it was not aware of the toxicity of PHMG, prosecutors said.Civic activists surround the building of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser Korea\u2019s building in Yeouido in a protest over the humidifier sterilizer case on Monday. YonhapThe KFTC report was made in August 2012 when the agency launched a separate probe into Oxy\u2019s alleged false indication of ingredients. The agency later fined the company 52 million won ($44,000).The MSDS information was shared in every step of the chemical trading from PHMG manufacturer SK Chemicals to humidifier disinfectant manufacturer Oxy, the KFTC said. Prosecution sources also said that Oxy allegedly destroyed all the MSDS from 2001 to 2011, ahead of the prosecutorial probe launched earlier this year. Meanwhile, the prosecution on Monday summoned an original equipment manufacturer head surnamed Kim, who manufactured disinfectants that Lotte Mart and Homeplus sold as their private brand goods. Of the total official 221 victims, 41 used Lotte Mart\u2019s product, with 16 deaths, and 28 used Homeplus\u2019s product, with 12 deaths. Lotte Mart and Homeplus sold the humidifier disinfectants made of PHMG from 2006 and 2004, respectively, until August 2011 when the government announced the toxicity of the humidifier disinfectant. The prosecution suspects that Lotte Mart and Homeplus copied the manufacturing manual of Oxy, unlike Oxy which developed and tested the product on its own. It has banned the overseas travel of former Lotte Mart head Lee Chul-woo and former Homeplus head Lee Seung-han. Meanwhile, the victims and their families launched a group compensation lawsuit on Monday against the central government, disinfectant manufacturers and distributors. Minbyun, a group of liberal lawyers who are supporting the lawsuit, said 436 people filed the lawsuit to seek 11 billion won of compensation against the government and 22 companies, including Oxy, SK Chemicals and Cefu. Of the plaintiffs, 235 are the actual victims, with 51 dead. Of those victims, 63 are underage and five were killed, Minbyun said. The group said it will seek 50 million won for each dead victim, 30 million won each for those who suffers lung damage, and 10 million for each family member of the victims for mental damage. \u201cThe Constitution Article 36 stipulates that the health of all citizens should be protected by the state. The country should have taken clear measures to protect the public,\u201d said lawyer Choi Jae-hong, who leads the group lawsuit. \u201cThe prosecution and the Environment Ministry have kept the stance that they are uncertain of their legal accountability, citing the lack of regulations in the past. However, it is likely that the country has compensation responsibility as it did not require the companies to conduct the inhalation-toxicity test, negligently allowing the sales of the problematic products.\u201dBy Lee Hyun-jeong\u00a0 (rene@heraldcorp.com)","477":"The Environment Ministry said Monday that it will order a recall of Japanese automaker Nissan\u2019s Qashqai compact crossovers, as the company manipulated its emissions result.The ministry is set to charge Nissan Korea 330 million won ($280,000) in fines and suspend sales of the emissions-faked model. A total of 814 cars sold since November have been ordered to be recalled. The company should submit its recall plan within 45 days. According to the ministry, Nissan faked its emissions test results by using a defeat device that allows the vehicles\u2019 emissions to be controlled by a company-manufactured emission reduction device. The ministry\u2019s own experiment showed that Qashqai in fact discharged nearly 20 times more nitrogenous compound (1.36 grams per kilometer) than the ministry standard of 0.08 g\/km.An Environment Ministry official demonstrates the exhaust gas recirculation system of Nissan\u2019s Qashqai model during a press conference Monday. (Yonhap)But the company denied the claim, saying \u201cit had never used any device to manipulate the emissions results,\u201d in an official statement released Monday. It also added that it would \u201cfully cooperate with the ministry to resolve the issue.\u201dThe ministry is set to file a suit against Takehiko Kikuchi, head of Nissan Korea, and cancel the certification of Qashqai\u2019s emissions results approved last year. The ministry\u2019s action came after the government conducted a probe into 20 models of diesel cars here over the past five months, following German automaker Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal last October. According to the ministry, BMW\u2019s 520d was the only model that followed the ministry\u2019s standard, with emissions of 0.07 g\/km of nitrogen dioxide.Some other 17 makes of diesel cars, including Land Rover\u2019s Range Rover Evoque, Volkwagen\u2019s Golf, Ssangyong\u2019s Tivoli, KIA\u2019s Sportage and Audi\u2019s A3 discharged from 1.6 to 10.8 times more nitrogen dioxide than the standard. Renault Samsung\u2019s QM3 emitted about 17 times more nitrogenous compound than the standard, the highest level followed by Nissan\u2019s Qashqai.\u00a0An official from the company told The Korea Herald that it\u00a0will\u00a0voluntarily put effort to\u00a0minimize the amount as low as five times\u00a0of the ministry standard by the end of this year.According to the revised Clean Air Act, the amount of exhaust fumes discharged from a new vehicle model launched from September 2017 onward must be within 2.1 times the ministry standard. Related emissions laws will be strengthened by 2020, with an upper ceiling of 1.5 times the standard. Vehicles that do not meet the standard will be banned from sales, regardless of whether the carmaker rigged the emissions result or not. The ministry vowed to conduct probes on at least 100 diesel-engine vehicles annually through frequent inspections on emissions test results. Last year, Volkswagen was found to have faked the emission results of its diesel models, which led to an unprecedented recall in the country of at least 120,000 vehicles.

In March, the U.K. announced a plan to impose a new tax on sugary drinks.\u00a0(123rf)In 2014, Berkeley city council in California introduced a \u201csoda tax,\u201d becoming the first jurisdiction in the U.S. to pass penalty taxes on the sugar-sweetened beverages. South Korea has also joined the move to reduce sugar intake. In April, the government said that it aimed to cut down on the amount of sugar consumed by Koreans to 10 percent of their daily diet by 2020. It plans to require manufacturers to specify the level of sugar in their products. But it is only in recent times that sugar has become known as a harmful substance. When sugar was first discovered by the people of New Guinea in around B.C. 8,000, it was considered as a panacea for illness and the epitome of wealth. The 12th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas famously wrote \u201ceating sugar is not breaking a religious fast because it was a medicine taken to aid digestion,\u201d when confronted with the question of where consuming sugar should fall fasting rules. A renowned anthropologist Sidney Mintz said in his book \u201cSwiftness and Power,\u201d one of the most influential publications about food history, that sugar served at dinner was used as an indicator of the wealth of aristocrats in Europe. Sugar enjoys similar popularity in present-day South Korea. The Shinsegae Museum of Korean Commercial History shows that sugar was one of the most sought-after gifts during holidays, alongside flour, eggs and sesame oil. People often served sugar water to guests at home. \u201cAs recently as the 1960s, there were not enough dietary supplements to make you felt reinvigorated. People were drinking sugar water when they felt tired and sick. It is pretty much the same as getting a glucose injection,\u201d said a public relation official from the Korea Sugar Association. The origin of sugar in Korea dates back to the 13th century. It first appeared in the literary work \u201cPahanjib,\u201d authored by poet and politician Lee In-ro in 1260 during the Goryeo Dynasty. Historians said that sugar was introduced before then and came from China. Back then, it was a luxury product used by elites. It was only in the early 20th century that the public gained access to sugar. Sugary cookies and pies, imported from Japan, were introduced to the people. In 1922, the first sugar refinery was established in Pyongyang by a Japanese company. The Korean-owned sugar company was built in 1953 by Lee Byung-chul, founder of Samsung Group. CheilJedang, which has now become the biggest food company here, was capable of producing 25 tons of sugar per day by processing raw sugar, which was given to the war-torn country as foreign aid. The massive production eased the nation\u2019s reliance on imported sugar. Back in 1953, Korea had imported all sugar from Japan and elsewhere. But the proportion of imported sugar dropped several years later and only 7 percent of sugar was imported in 1956.With more sugar being produced, its consumption soared too. According the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the amount of sugar consumed has increased almost 20 times over the past 60 years. In 1953, Koreans on average ate 984 grams of sugar a year, but the amount rose to 22 kilograms in 2012.

White House officials said Obama wants to use the visit to \"highlight his continued commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\" and \"to honor the memory of all innocents who were lost during the war.\"But the planned visit raised concern that it could dilute Japan's wartime aggression by making the country look like a victim, even though U.S. officials said the visit shouldn't be interpreted as an apology and Obama won't revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb.On Thursday, White House Asian Affairs spokesman Myles Caggins reaffirmed that the visit is aimed at honoring not only innocent Japanese A-bomb victims, but also all innocents killed in the war.\"President Obama's visit is designed to honor the memory of all innocents lost in World War II, including at Hiroshima,\" Caggins told Yonhap News Agency.As many as some 140,000 were killed in the Hiroshima bombing on August 6, 1945, and some 20,000 of them were Koreans. The U.S. dropped another atomic bomb in the city of Nagasaki three days later, leaving as many as 80,000 people dead, and some 10,000 of them are believed to be Koreans.Whether Obama would visit Hiroshima on the sidelines of a Group of Seven summit has been a focus of attention since Secretary of State John Kerry made a landmark visit to the city last month and said he would convey to Obama what he saw in Hiroshima and \"how important it is at some point to try to get here.\"Obama has sought to make the initiative for building a nuclear-free world a key legacy of his presidency, launching the Nuclear Security Summit of world leaders aimed at reducing the stockpile of fissile material and keeping it out of the hands of terrorists.

Moon Sang-kyun, spokesman for the Defense Ministry, said in a press briefing that the deployment will commence this year with 100 K2 tanks.\u201cMilitary officials have raised the need (for the tanks) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided (to increase the number) after considering several technological and environmental changes,\u201d said a JCS official. He did not elaborate on the exact reason for the plan change.K2 Black Panther tanks (Yonhap)There has been speculation that it was motivated by North Korea\u2019s recent plan to increase deployment of the newer Chonma-ho and Songun-ho tanks. While the North\u2019s 4,300 tanks vastly outnumber the South\u2019s 2,400, Seoul is generally seen as having a technological advantage. But the North\u2019s recently unveiled Songun-ho is thought to have tactical capacities that extends far beyond its other tanks. Military sources speculate that Songun-ho, which first appeared at the North\u2019s military parade in 2010, has a longer range and can accelerate to up to 70 kph, exceeding 60 kph of Pyongyang\u2019s previously deployed Pokpung-ho. It is also assessed to have 125-milimeter-caliber gun turret along with night vision facilities and upgraded fire-control system.The 55-ton Black Panther can accelerate to up to 70 kph on roads with 1,500 horsepower. It is armed with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L\/55 smoothbore gun and a 12.7 mm M2 Browning heavy machine gun. The initial 100 tanks will be equipped with a German-built power pack, while the rest will feature a domestically designed power pack.The JCS initially applied for 600 K2 tanks, but the plan was scaled down to 200 considering the costs and military priorities. The tanks cost about 8 billion won ($6.9 million) each. The military said K2 will replace the U.S.-built M48 Patton tanks. Adding that only the K2, K1 and other advanced K-series tanks will be deployed in the frontlines. It is speculated that the increased production of the K2s was decided to help the struggling domestic defense industry. The Army has released another plan to introduce 1.8 trillion won worth of Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters for antitank capabilities.Such speculation was fueled by the fact that the addition of K2 tanks was not included in the Defense Ministry\u2019s five-year plan announced in March.The ministry denied such allegations, and said that the exclusion of K2 tanks in the March plans was a simple mistake.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","485":"Danish chemical company KeTox -- which allegedly supplied PGH to Korean company Butterflyeffect -- has denied any links to the firm, a civic group working with the victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants said Thursday.The Danish company denied any business deals with Butterflyeffect in a meeting with representatives of the victims in Denmark on Sunday, according to Choi Ye-yong of the Asian Citizen\u2019s Center for Environment and Health.The now closed company\u2019s former CEO Frede Damgaard reportedly said that all they had sent to Korea was a 40 ml PGH sample for agricultural use, along with a materials safety data sheet, to an unnamed Korean company in 2007.

North Korea's just-concluded party congress officially endorsed Kim's \"byeongjin\" policy of simultaneously pursing both nuclear and economic development, dashing hopes that Kim may chart a different course on its nuclear weapons program. In an editorial, the state-run China Daily newspaper said Kim's policy \"does signify a step forward from songun,\" or the military-first policy by his late father, Kim Jong-il. \"But it is simply beyond Pyongyang's competence to pursue the twin goals at once. The country's limited resources can't support both. Nor will the international community allow its nuclearization,\" the editorial reads. The Chinese paper said Kim \"appears unaware that his nuclear ambitions are poison for his country's economy.\" \"They will not only exhaust his country's very limited resources but will further isolate his country from the rest of the world, politically and economically,\" it said. North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests since 2006. The latest nuclear test in January prompted China to back tougher U.N. sanctions against the traditional ally. Further consolidating his grip on power, Kim was elected chairman of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party during the party conclave, which was held for the first time in 36 years. Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message on Monday to Kim on his promotion, hoping to steadily develop the friendship between the allies.

North Korea marked the completion of the dam's construction on April 28 with a ceremony attended by the country's key officials from the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). The satellite imagery indicates the power plant started to show signs of problems less than 10 days after building work was officially completed. North Korea had been hurrying to finish the construction project in the runup to the rare WPK congress, which ended Monday.The four daylong congress helped strengthen Kim's hold on power. He was made the new chairman of the ruling party.The dam generated attention last October after the North Korean leader issued an order to finish the construction of the Paektusan Here Youth Power Station No. 3 by Youth Day (Aug. 30) next year under any conditions. At the congress session, Kim once again referred to the construction project, hailing it as one of the country's industrial accomplishments.North Korea kicked off a campaign to increase output by getting people to work more. A source familiar with the isolated country claimed that it is because of this push to speed up production that may have led to problems at the dam. \"Many of North Korea's show-off projects have been the object of criticism for shoddy construction,\" the source said. \"The latest mishap could lead to punishment for those involved because of the damage it could mean for the country's leadership,\"Other Pyongyang watchers then said the construction of the dam caused the deaths of a dozen construction workers because they were forced to work in the midst of extreme winter cold without proper nutrition or protective gear.

The state-run institute questioned 8,000 youths aged 18 and younger between 2013 and 2015 to find out the extent to which children are exposed to the environment.The study found that the children aged 3-9 spent 34 minutes a day playing outside, less than a third of the time American kids spent (119 minutes). Canadian children played outdoors for 100 minutes each day. Korean children aged 7-9 spent 36 minutes outdoors per day on average, while they spent twice as long taking extra classes and watching TV, respectively. They spent 34 minutes surfing the Internet.\u00a0 The lack of outdoor activities is often linked to heightened health risks for children\u2019s mental and physical well-being. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children spend at least 60 minutes in daily unstructured free play which it called \u201can essential part of children\u2019s physical and mental health and social development.\u201d The body pointed out that children who play outside are less aggressive and have better concentration, among other health benefits.

They have told me that they are fed up with the homework, but it seems there is no way to escape,\u201d Park told The Korea Herald. Many after-school programs at private elementary schools are different from those at public schools. While public school students usually do various activities in the after-class programs, private school students often have extra English classes on top of them.\u00a0Parents of private elementary school students in Seoul hold a rally against the government\u2019s decision to ban immersion education in November 2013. YonhapSuch intensive English classes, often conducted in the form of immersion, remain prevalent at private elementary schools, despite it being illegal for first- and second-graders.In February this year, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Education Ministry\u2019s ban on English immersion programs was constitutional. The complaint against the ban was filed in December 2013 by parents of students attending Young Hoon Elementary School in Seoul, which introduced its English immersion program in the late 1990s.The English immersion program, designed to let lower-grade students improve their English proficiency, consisted of mandatory English-only classes with foreign textbooks under foreign faculties. The subjects ranged from English language to math and science. The school claimed that the program, which soon spread to other private schools, was in accordance with the law that allows private schools to draw up their own curriculums. The Education Ministry prohibited the immersion program in 2012 for the first two grades, raising concerns about the Korean language ability of young students and excessive private education fever. Later grades also received a time limit on their immersion classes. Objecting to the ministry\u2019s decision, some 1,000 parent of Young Hoon students filed the constitutional appeal, claiming that there is no scientific proof that the intensive English classes for low-grade students affect the learning of their mother tongue. The parents also filed an administrative lawsuit against the ministry but the court dismissed the case in 2014. Despite the two courts\u2019 decisions, many private schools have resorted to an anomaly operation, by running the \u201coptional\u201d English immersion program after school. While the ministry has also banned advanced learning at schools since last year, there is no specific restraint on how after school classes are conducted.Private elementary schools have abused this loophole by branding their English immersion curriculums as after school program. Some schools even hold regular midterms and finals in their after school schedules, just like a regular curriculum.\u201cAlthough the extra after-school classes are optional, it\u2019s practically mandatory because students cannot follow the regular curriculum without them,\u201d said an anonymous mother of a student who goes to a private elementary school in Seoul. According to the civic group World Without Worry About Shadow Education, 52 out of 76 private elementary schools in the country violate English class-related rules. Of the total 39 schools in the capital, the majority of the schools run the English immersion program for first and second graders in the after-school schedule. The civic group pointed out that the programs are being run as compulsory courses under their regular curriculum. \u201cAlthough the regular English classes are allowed from the third grade, the actual difficulty level is designed for those who have studied English in the two previous years. Students cannot help but attend the immersion program,\u201d said Choi Hyun-joo, researcher at the WWSE. The civic organization has urged the education authorities to conduct stern monitoring on the schools, arguing that the English immersion program triggers excessive private education costs. According to Rep. Park Hong-keun of The Minjoo Party of Korea, some private elementary schools were found to have charged students about 10 million won ($8,500) a year solely for the English immersion program, with some exceeding 11 million won. The after-school programs of public schools cost around 50,000 won per month on average.\u201cThis English immersion program not only abuses the education rules but also affects the equal opportunity of education. Although private schools may have discretion to design their own curriculum, there are still some curriculum rules that they have to follow,\u201d said English language education professor Lee Byung-min at Seoul National University. \u201cElementary education is mandatory for all nationals, which means that it is the basic education for Korean citizens. That is why all the hours of curriculum such as Korean history are fixed by the ministry. Studying with foreign textbooks and learning in a foreign language also raises a question as to which country the students are being educated in.\u201d The efficacy of the immersion program has also been questioned.\u201cIt is important to assess if the immersion program practically involves immersion into English. The real immersion is only possible when students, who use English in daily life, learn new concepts in English. At private schools, they just review the concepts in English that they previously learned in Korean. It\u2019s just a modified version of immersion,\u201d said English education expert Lee Wan-ki at Seoul National University of Education. \u201cThe ideal immersion is realistically impossible in the Korean system.\u201dThe more concerning aspect of the intensive English program is the impact on the linguistic ability development of the low graders, some experts pointed out.\u201cI see many low graders showing slower understanding in other courses, not because of their intellectual level but because of their poor Korean ability.

The country's overall unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in March, down from 4.9 percent the previous month.The government has often blamed rigidity in the labor market for the high jobless rate, claiming automatic annual pay raises have long prevented the voluntary departure of under-performing employees, and also citing labor market rigidity as a cause of the ongoing slump for Asia's fourth-largest economy.In its latest quarterly revision announced last month, the Bank of Korea projected the local economy will expand 2.8 percent this year, down from a 3 percent on-year expansion forecast three months earlier.Previous government efforts to boost labor flexibility included a wage peak system, under which workers, often regardless of their performance, will have their salary permanently reduced once they reach a certain age. The system too has faced and continues to face strong resistance from the two labor organizations -- the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU).The two labor organizations promised an even stronger fight against the performance-linked wage system, insisting that the evaluation of so-called performance cannot but be subjective, which in turn will force laborers to be nothing but obedient.\"A wage system that will grade laborers based on how close they are to the management and pay different wages based on such evaluation will only weaken or remove public service of public firms and threaten the lives and safety of the people,\" they said in a joint press conference in Seoul.The two labor organizations said they will hold a protest rally in Seoul on June 18, with some 50,000 people expected to take part.They will stage an all-out walkout of their 200,000-strong members in September if the government continues to push for the introduction of the new wage system, they added. The labor organizations agree the new wage system will help reduce the jobless rate, but only by creating what they call temporary and poor-quality jobs.On Monday, the government said it will freeze the wages of workers at all public enterprises that fail to introduce or expand the performance-based wage system before the year's end.On the other hand, those that voluntarily introduce the new wage system before the deadline will be given an incentive of up to 30 percent of their workers' monthly salary, according to the finance ministry, which aims to introduce the new pay system to 120 public companies and institutions in the first phase by the year's end.Already, more than 40 percent of the 120 entities had introduced or completed a process to introduce the new wage system as of Monday.Resistance is particularly strong among financial public companies.Kim Jae-chun, CEO of Korea Housing Finance Corp., offered to resign last week after over 85 percent of its unionized employees voted down the performance-based salary system. The Korea Development Bank, the Industrial Bank of Korea, the Export-Import Bank of Korea and almost all other state-run banks have yet to shift to the new pay system.Yim Jong-yong, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, convened a meeting of financial public company CEOs on Tuesday and warned that institutions failing to comply with the performance-based pay will be given various disadvantages in compensation, budget allowance and payrolls.\"A culture of performance-based salary should be introduced to financial public companies as soon as possible, in order to shake off their easy-going image,\" said Yim. (Yonhap)","499":"Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent a congratulatory letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who has been given the new title of the chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea during a key party congress, the North's state media said Tuesday.The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said that Xi sent the letter to Kim on Monday. The key party congress, the first in 36 years, opened Friday and ended Monday. In the letter, Xi said he offers \"fervent\" congratulations to Kim on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, according to the KCNA. He also said that the Chinese party and government \"highly cherish\" the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang.Portraying the two countries' traditional neighborly ties as a \"shared invaluable asset,\" Xi added that China will work together with the North to contribute to regional peace, stability and development.The sending of the letter came amid several years of diplomatic estrangement between the two countries due to Pyongyang's continued provocations, including a fourth nuclear test in January and a series of ballistic missile launches early this year.China has recently vowed to fully enforce the U.N. Security Council sanctions that were imposed on the North in early March in response to its latest nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February. The move had further dimmed the prospect of a thaw in the Beijing-Pyongyang relations.But amid stepped-up efforts to strengthen security cooperation among South Korea, the U.S., and Japan, China might have felt the need to improve ties with its ally, the North, said Hwang Jae-ho, an international politics professor at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\"China might have recognized the strategic value of the North as its rival the U.S., South Korea and Japan are working closely together to build stronger defense relations,\" he said.Analysts had also predicted that Pyongyang would seek a way to mend ties with Beijing, its only major ally and patron, to ease its deepening international isolation and shore up its debilitated economy.\u00a0 Since Xi took power in 2013, he has yet to hold any bilateral summit with the reclusive North Korean leader, which has underscored the diplomatic tension between the two neighbors. The North's dogged pursuit of nuclear arms has been cited as the biggest stumbling block to the bilateral relationship as China has called for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and stressed the importance of stability along its border regions. (Yonhap)","500":"North Korea has adopted a decision to elect its leader Kim Jong-un as the chairman of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), the North's state media said Tuesday, a move aimed at bolstering the leader's tight control on power.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said that the North's leader was elected to the \"top post\" of the ruling party -- chairman of the WPK -- at the first party congress in 36 years, which concluded its four-day run Monday.The country revised its party rules, which stipulate that its top post is \"chairman of the WPK and he is its supreme leader who represents the party and leads the whole party.\"Kim has been at the top post of the ruling party, but his previous title was the first secretary of the WPK. He also serves as the first chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army.The seventh party congress served as a venue to reaffirm Kim's dual pursuit of nuclear and economic development, and to highlight the role of the WPK as the paramount political body in the North.The current leader's late father Kim Jong-il advocated a military first, or \"songun,\" policy, highlighting the role of the military, but the young leader has shifted his focus to the WPK while simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development. At the party gathering, Kim has made it clear that he will \"permanently\" defend the pursuit of his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.The party congress has decided to enshrine the leader's policy of simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development in its revised party rules, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the country's main newspaper.The North's leader conducted a reshuffle of top party officials but not in a drastic manner, experts said.The KCNA said that at a plenary meeting, the WPK's central committee elected five members to the standing committee of the party's politburo, including the North's leader.The four other members are ceremonial leader Kim Yong-nam; Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of North Korea's armed forces; premier of the Cabinet Pak Pong-ju; and Choe Ryong-hae, a party secretary.The party's central committee also elected 19 members and nine alternate members of the party's political bureau, according to the KCNA.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong was named as one of the 19 Politburo members. Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of the North's leader, was not mentioned on the list, but she became one of the party's 129 central committee members.The committee also decided to set up a new political affairs bureau named \"the Executive Policy Bureau,\" which will be led by the North's leader.\"The latest reshuffle did not involve a dramatic generational change,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. \"It means that the North's leader has consolidated his power in a stable manner.\"Experts said that it is noteworthy that Choe Ryong-hae has been tapped as a member of the standing committee of the party's politburo, an indication that he has become a key aide to the North's leader.Choe served as a standing member of the political bureau in 2014 and 2015, which effectively made him the third-highest ranking person in the communist country at the time.But he is believed to have lost favor and received re-education at a rural farm late last year as punishment for his mishandling of a newly built hydroelectric power plant project.At the latest shakeup of party elites, Choe has also become a vice chairman of the newly created bureau of political affairs.\"Choe has returned as one of the closest aides to the North's leader,\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. \"He is now seen as the No. 2 man in the party.\"North Korean top diplomat Ri's ascent to a politburo member was also noteworthy due to a possibility that he may have replaced Kang Sok-ju, a secretary handling international relations at the party, analysts said. Kang is known to be in poor health.Ri is believed to have served as a guardian of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when Kim studied at an international school in Switzerland in the 1990s.Meanwhile, the North's military official Ri Yong-gil was found on the list of alternate members of the party's political bureau, trumping rumors that he might have been executed.South Korea's spy agency said in February that Army Gen. Ri, a former chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was executed on corruption and other charges, and replaced by Ri Myong-su, a former minister of people's security.The sudden disappearance of North Korean officials is usually viewed by outside analysts as being linked to a possible purge or punishment.Since taking power, the North's leader has executed around 100 party and military officials to take a firmer grip on power, according to South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy. (Yonhap)","501":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been given the new title of the chairman of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in a high-profile party congress which kicked off last week, a Japanese media report said Monday.At the first party congress in 36 years, the North's leader was bestowed with the newly-created title earlier in the day, according to Japan-based broadcaster NHK.The decision came as the country planned to elect the North's leader to \"the top post\" of the WPK at the party gathering which opened on Friday.Before the party decision came out, the North's leader had three titles -- the first secretary of the WPK, the first chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army.NHK also reported that the congress elected two more standing members of the WPK's political bureau -- premier of the Cabinet Pak Pong-ju and Choe Ryong-hae, a party secretary.The move has raised the number of the standing members to five including the North's leader Kim Jong-un, ceremonial leader Kim Yong-nam and Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of North Korea's armed forces. (Yonhap)","502":"The number of South Korean babies with birth defects has increased significantly since the early 1990s, likely due to traffic-related air pollutants and endocrine disruptors, a study showed Monday. The report, by Inha University\u2019s Social and Preventive Medicine department, researched the national health insurance data of 403,250 infants aged 0-1 living in Korea\u2019s seven metropolitan areas between 2009 and 2010. It found that 5.5 percent of all infants researched during the period had birth defects, an increase from the 3.3 percent of those born between 1993 and 1994. Among all birth defects reported in the period of 2009-2010, hypospadias -- a birth defect of the urethra where the urinary opening is not on the head of the male genital -- had the highest increase rate of all birth defects from 1993-2010. The prevalence rate of the abnormality increased from 0.7 per 10,000 in 1993-1994 to 9.9 per 10,000 in 2009-2010. Meanwhile, the number of cases of cryptorchidism, the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum, also increased significantly from 2.6 per 10,000 to 29.1 per 10,000.Researchers suggest the increasing number of defects in the Korean newborns\u2019 genital and urinary systems may have been caused by pregnant women\u2019s exposure to air pollutants and endocrine disruptors. (123Rf)Citing overseas studies published in the past, the researchers suggested the increasing number of defects in the Korean newborns\u2019 genital and urinary systems, such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, may have been caused by pregnant women\u2019s exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and endocrine disruptors such as Bisphenol A, which is primarily used to make plastics. They said that an environmental surveillance system needs to be established in South Korea to prevent birth defects. Among all birth defects reported from 2009-2010, genital and urinary tract defects were in fact the second most common condition, with a prevalence rate of 130.1 per 10,000, following heart defects which stood at 180.8 per 10,000. \u201cPrevious studies have suggested that the prevalence of undescended testis increased during the past half century in industrialized countries,\u201d the paper noted. \u201cA study conducted in China reported an average annual increase in the overall prevalence of hypospadias of 7.34 percent from 1996 to 2008. The authors suggest that environmental exposure might play a critical role in the development of hypospadias.\u201dA 2013 study by Stanford University School of Medicine also found an association between traffic-related air pollutants and malformations of the brain and spine of newborns in California. The Inha University study also suggested that exposure to endocrine disruptors -- chemicals that, at certain doses, can interfere with the hormone system in humans -- may have increased the number of newborns with birth defects in Korea. According to the paper, chemicals such as pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, naturally occurring plant estrogens, bisphenol A and mycotoxins have been reported to affect human pregnancies. This correlates to a French study published last year in European Urology, which found that pregnant women who are exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals at work, such as cleaners, hairdressers and laboratory workers, are more likely to have baby boys with a genital defect. The Korean researchers also found that South Korea\u2019s prevalence rate of spina bifida (7.7 per 10,000) -- a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord -- is notably higher than the rates in other developed nations, such as the U.S. (3.8 per 10,000), Finland (4.62 per 10,000) and Canada (4.28 per 10,000). The paper suggested that this may be associated with the inadequate consumption of folate acid among Korean women. \u201cThe lack of this nutrient is known to cause spina bifida. \u2026 A recent study in Korea reported that only 10.3 percent of Korean women consume folate acid in the periconceptional period.\u201dMeanwhile, cases of Atrial Septal Defect, a congenital heart defect which involves a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the organ, also increased significantly from 9.7 per 10,000 newborns to 117.9 per 10,000, while cases of congenital polycystic kidney disease, a disorder in which clusters of cysts develop within kidneys, also increased from 0.7 per 10,000 to 29.1 per 10,000.

The control group was comprised of 60 same-age, same-gender peers who lived in the same neighborhoods but didn't use the sterilizers.Instead of releasing the survey results, the CDC belatedly announced them in the form of a thesis in the U.S. science journal of PLOS one in 2015. It sparked criticisms that it should have revealed the results sooner given the severity of the lung damage in affected consumers.Most of the victims used humidifier sterilizers made by Britain's Oxy Reckitt Benckiser. Oxy is currently being probed by state prosecutors over its toxic humidifier sterilizers that have been cited for causing many deaths and illnesses. Oxy started selling its products here in 2001.Korea confirmed 221 people as victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products. Out of 90 deaths, 70 are believed to have been using Oxy products. In early May, Oxy Korea CEO Ata Safdar made an official apology and vowed to fully cooperate with the Korean government in the ongoing investigation. Now the focus is on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Prosecutors reportedly plan to summon several foreign executives, including former CEO John Lee, definitely involved in key management decisions at Oxy Korea in mid and late 2000s. They are suspected of pushing forward sales of the toxic products despite consumer complaints about side effects.The ruling Saenuri Party will \"positively\" consider holding a parliamentary hearing and probe into the case in a follow-up to the on-going prosecution investigation, party officials said after their consultation with the government earlier in the day.The party also agreed with the government to hold safety tests of each and every biocide product on the domestic market, the officials also said.

According to the report released by the Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute, 16.6 percent of Koreans said in a survey conducted in 2014 that an individual is responsible to finance their own post-retirement years. It showed a 1.7-fold increase from 9.6 percent in 2002. At the same time, the number of those who think family members, including grown-up children, should emotionally and financially care for their aging parents dropped dramatically from 70.7 percent to 31.7 percent over the same time period.\u00a0 (123RF)Those who felt that the government and family members should share the cost of caring for elderly parents increased from 18.2 percent to 47.3 percent.Filial piety \u2013 caring for one\u2019s parents both emotionally and physically -- has been largely considered as one of the most important traditional values here. Until the mid-1980s, all grown-up children in Korea, especially sons, were \u201cexpected to have the responsibility and obligation for their aged parents\u2019 well-being because of the reciprocal dependence of successive generations,\u201d according to scholar Keun Young Chung Peng\u2019s 2000 book \u201cVirtuous Transcendence.\u201d\u201cParents may depend on all their sons because all their sons have depended on them,\u201d the scholar wrote in the book. \u201cEach son has a debt from his early years that has to be repaid.\u201dThe current law also states that all adult Koreans are legally obligated to financially support their spouses, parents and parents-in-laws. Yet with the nation\u2019s changing family structure along with its high youth unemployment rate and expensive living cost, more elderly citizens here are becoming unable to rely on their children to take care of them. As of last year, 1.38 million elderly Koreans were living alone, almost a two-fold increase from 777,000 back in 2005. Those who live alone accounted for 20 percent of the entire Korean elderly population last year. According to a recent study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, only 4.2 percent of elderly Koreans who lived alone said they didn\u2019t have any problems while living on their own. The biggest proportion of them, 37.2 percent, said the most concerning issue was having no one to take care of them when they were ill. Meanwhile, 24.4 percent of them said they suffer from loneliness and anxiety, while 21.6 percent said they are worried about their finances.The report from the KWDI also found that the proportion of elderly Koreans who receive financial support from their grown children dropped from 40.1 percent to 23 percent from 2005-2014. Meanwhile, the number of Korean parents who sued their children for financial support more than doubled from 135 in 2004 to 262 last year. More than 75 percent of elderly Koreans surveyed by a local pollster last year said \u201cfilial duty contracts\u201d \u2013 a legal document that makes it mandatory for all grown children to financially care for their aged parents \u2013 are necessary should children receive any gifts such as real estate or stocks from their parents. Health Ministry data showed that of 5,772 reported instances of elderly abuse in 2014, 51.1 percent of the abusers were the victims\u2019 adult children. A study last year by the National Pension Research Institute found public transfer payments, such as retirement benefits and living allowance, only made up about 28.8 percent of the average income of the Korean elderly, with almost 50 percent of them living below the poverty line \u2013 the highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member nations. In other developed countries such as Denmark, Finland and Australia, public transfer payments accounted for at least 70 percent of the average income of their elderly citizens.\u00a0By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","510":"To mark its fifth anniversary, the Arab film festival will showcase movies this month that will unravel the intricate tapestry of culture and humanity in the Middle East and North Africa.

He claimed that he has been suffering from depression after guarding against terrorism during his overseas post. The court said the correlation was weak.The former lieutenant colonel started his military career in 1983.He served as the defense attache at the South Korean Embassy in Iraq from February 2004 for one year and five months. He was in charge of making location plans for the South Korean troops deployed there to help rehabilitation and analyze the movements of terrorist groups there. His role included sharing information with the embassy and the troops, preparing diplomatic measures for emergencies and working with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.In June, 2004, the former military man helped bring the body of Kim Sun-il, a South Korean civilian who was abducted and beheaded by the Islamist group after the South Korean government refused its demand to pull its troops out of the international forces there and cancel its plan to send more. The man claimed he had to carry out emotionally difficult roles such as repeatedly checking Kim\u2019s body during the process.Upon returning home, the man reportedly received psychological treatment in October 2010 due to amnesia and was diagnosed with depression. He was released from duty in October 2012 and applied to be registered as man of national merit, citing depression and posttraumatic stress in 2014. He claimed he developed these conditions by serving in Iraq and that his mission there was relevant to protecting the nation and the people\u2019s lives.The court, however, ruled against him, citing laws that grant the status only to those who have injured themselves or become ill while serving overseas on reconstruction, medical and restoration missions.\u201cWhile the role that (the man) had undertaken may apply to the conditions for men of merit, he has not been directly involved in an accident or suffered an injury to his head,\u201d the ruling said. It also cited that he continued to serve his duty normally until 2007, during which he received four commendations.

South Korean experts and government officials say the comment hints at the softened attitude of Kim, who has stepped up nuclear and missile threats against Seoul and Washington, but by no means implies its intent to take actual steps toward its own denuclearization as demanded by the allies.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un speaks during the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's Congress in this photo distributed by communist state's Korea Central News Agency on Saturday. (Yonhap)According to the Korea Central News Agency, Kim claimed that his country had become a nuclear state by conducting its first hydrogen bomb in Jan. 6, which most experts along with Seoul and Washington\u2019s government officials have said is highly unlikely to be true.\u201cAs a responsible nuclear state, our republic (North Korea) will not preemptively use a nuclear weapon unless hostile forces attempt to infringe upon our autonomy with nukes. We will carry out our obligation of nuclear non-proliferation for the international society, and work toward realizing denuclearization of the world,\u201d he said during the second day of the congress of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. The event is expected to last for up to four days, with the party unveiling its future goals and naming Kim to the highest-ranked position in the party.\u00a0 As Kim\u2019s father and former leader Kim Jong-il holds the position of \u201ceternal general secretary,\u201d there are expectations that Kim will be named to a newly-created position.In addition, he said that military officials of the Koreas should hold talks and negotiations to \u201caddress mistrust and misunderstanding\u201d between each other, once again urging the U.S. not to intervene in peninsular affairs.The North is currently under U.N.-led sanctions, intended as punitive actions against its January nuclear test and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch which violated previous U.N. resolution banning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. While this marks the first time the North leader has mentioned denuclearization at all, government officials have said that such remarks do not indicate that the communist will abandon its nuclear programs.\u201cNot much has changed, since Kim said that the North\u2019s actions will be \u2018as a nuclear state.\u2019 It just means that he wants to reaffirm his country\u2019s status as a self-proclaimed nuclear state,\u201d said a high-ranking South Korean military official.During his WPK speech, Kim said that developing nuclear weapons in parallel with boosting its economy -- which Pyongyang adopted as its official strategic goal in 2013 -- is now its permanent objective.Contrary to the North\u2019s claim of having a nuclear strike capacity, it has yet to demonstrate its ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount onto a ballistic missile. Its botched launches of the intermediate-range Musudan missile last month puts the country\u2019s nuclear strike capacity further in doubt. The official added that the military cannot consider Kim\u2019s offer of talks, as the government\u2019s stance right now is that the North giving up its nuclear programs should prelude recommencing negotiations.\u201cUnless North Korea takes some additional, meaningful actions -- such as ceasing production of nuclear materials -- (Kim\u2019s remarks) cannot be regarded as having a legitimate intent to resolve nuclear issues in the peninsula, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. The professor pointed out that the WPK\u2019s reports on its future plans did not have any mention of such actions, saying Kim\u2019s comments were largely \u201csymbolic.\u201d While Kim\u2019s comments were \u201cnothing new,\u201d University of North Korean Studies professor Yang Moo-jin said that it showed Kim\u2019s willingness to talk.North Korea threatened in late March to strike South Korea\u2019s President Park Geun-hye as a response to Seoul and Washington\u2019s annual joint military drills that concluded on April 30. South Korean military said last month that the North was seen preparing an attack simulation on a model of Cheong Wae Dae last month. Yang pointed out that the North had refrained from carrying out another nuclear test ahead of the WPK congress, as widely predicted by local experts and government officials.\u201cThere are two countries that can stop the North\u2019s nuclear test: China and the U.S. China has sent a strong message toward Pyongyang (to comply with calls made by the international society), and U.S. director of national intelligence (James) Clapper is said to have mentioned peace talks,\u201d he said.Local media reported that James Clapper, the DNI director, had asked South Korean government officials what conditions they would accept if the U.S. started to discuss peace talks with Pyongyang. Government officials refused to confirm the report.\u201cBoth the U.S. and China influenced (Pyongyang) not to conduct (additional) nuclear tests, and as an extension (of such influence), Kim is now sending a relatively peaceful message,\u201d Yang said.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at a local think-tank Sejong Institute, suggested that Kim\u2019s mention of inter-Korea talks and improving relations is not directed toward Park, but the next administration. Park has retained her hawkish approach toward the North, repeatedly mentioning the fall of Kim regime\u2019s downfall in public speeches.\u201cThe WPK\u2019s policies and directions are announced with the next five to 10 years in mind, which leads me to believe that the prospects of improving relations with the next (South Korean) leadership is factored in Kim\u2019s statement,\u201d Cheong said. \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s general election that took place right before the WPK congress, saw the opposition -- which is more positive toward inter-Korea talks -- taking an overwhelming victory. This may have led Kim to demonstrate a relatively softer attitude toward the South.\u201dObservers have said that Kim\u2019s seemingly softer remarks may reflect his will to find an exit strategy amid the powerful economic sanctions. Defense Minister Han Min-koo, in a report to the parliamentary defense committee last week, said that the international sanctions and preparations for the WPK congress has driven up complaints from\u00a0 North Korean citizens, leading to an increase in defection and robbery. Experts say it is unlikely for the hermit kingdom to conduct another nuclear test any time soon, But Kim Yong-hyun of Dongguk University said that there is a possibility that the North may test-launch another ballistic missile before the incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama completes his term in January 2017.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","513":"The ruling Saenuri Party decided Sunday to push for a hearing on the toxic humidifier disinfectant case after the prosecutorial probe is completed.After holding talks with the government, the party also decided to keep open the option of holding an audit against involved companies and government organizations if the hearing fails to fully clarify the wrongdoings related to the tragedy that left more than a hundred people dead after using the products containing toxic substances.(Yonhap)The party will also work with the government to conduct an overall inspection on all biocide type products that are currently being sold in South Korea. The follow-up measures will be taken care of by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, instead of the current Environment Ministry, the officials said.Families of the victims, and the members of the opposition parties, have been calling for parliamentary action to uncover those responsible and ensure compensation.\u201cThe National Assembly will launch a parliamentary probe and hearing, and speed up its efforts to revise necessary regulations,\u201d said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.\u201cThe government should also report (to the parliament) how products which were unauthorized in other countries could be sold in the local market, and check if any other hygiene products in sale are chemically safe,\u201d he added. The prosecutorial probe, meanwhile, is expected to widen to foreign officials of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser amid escalating public uproar over the massive number of deaths, sources said Sunday. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office is reportedly setting up schedules over when to summon several foreign executive board members of Oxy, who are knowledgeable about the company\u2019s operation. These include two former CEOs -- John Lee, a 48-year-old Korean national with American citizenship, and a 47-year-old. Lee served as the CEO from June 2005 to May 2010, succeeding Shin Hyun-woo who was summoned late last month. Sales of the problematic product surged while Lee was holding the post, the prosecution said. Lee is suspected of pushing ahead with the product sales despite continuous health complaints from users. The second man, who worked from May 2010 for two years, is suspected to have been a key person who directed to conceal key evidence.Prosecutors said that it was around the time he was holding a post in the company, that Oxy changed its corporation type and allegedly sought to manipulate Seoul National University\u2019s experiment report over the product toxicity test. The prosecution will also look into whether these former leaders served as a link between the Korean branch and the U.K. headquarters by sharing information and reports over the toxic product case, they added. A Seoul National University professor surnamed Cho was arrested Saturday on charges of manipulating evidence in favor of Oxy. Cho, 57, is suspecting of making up an experiment report that is allegedly advantageous to Oxy\u2019s stance over the product toxicity. In an alleged attempt to refute the government\u2019s health probe that pointed out humidifier disinfectant as the culprit behind more than a hundred deaths in 2011, the company had requested that Cho conduct a toxicity test of PHMG, the main ingredient of the humidifier disinfectant. Oxy allegedly handed over 250 million won ($216,000) to Cho for the experiment cost. Toxicity was found in the initial reproduction-toxicity test but Oxy allegedly bribed Cho to release an inhalation-toxicity test report in favor of the company. Prosecutors found that the company had sent a total of 12 million won to Cho\u2019s personal account on three occasions, separate from the experiment fee. In the following year, Cho released a health report that causality between the product use and the lung damage was not clear. Cho denied the allegations and said the company had not asked him for such a favor. Meanwhile, it was revealed that a 2013 report by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that use of the humidifier disinfectant could increase lung risk by 116 times. Based on a comparison between PHMG-exposed people and others under the same condition, the health agency confirmed that longer exposure to PHMG could lead to higher lung risks. The report was not released to the public, citing that the result was similar to the government\u2019s health probe result already released in 2011, the health authorities said. The report was published in international science journal PLOS ONE in March this year.Meanwhile, Kim Deok-jong, 40, a father who claims to have lost his son to Oxy\u2019s humidifier sterilizer said Saturday he will file a compensation suit against the British company later this month. Kim had gone to the U.K. headquarters last week to urge CEO Rakesh Kapoor to visit Seoul and officially apologizeHe said he decided to file the damage suit after the CEO refused his demand to visit South Korea to make an apology in front of the sterilizer\u2019s victims. His 5-year-old son died in 2009 due to a respiratory disease.The company, however, said in its press release that the CEO had sincerely apologized to them.\u201cMr. Kapoor repeated his heartfelt apology to all those victims who used Oxy HS products in Korea and extends his apology to all victims. He confirmed his commitment to a full resolution announced by Ata Safdar in Korea last week,\u201d the company said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","514":"Some 10 buoys that North Korea installed last year to apparently identify the western inter-Korean sea border were washed away, a government source said Sunday, amid constant concerns that the communist state would violate the maritime boundary.There are no signs yet of the North trying to reinstall the buoys -- with a diameter of less than 1 meter each - after it put in place a monitoring device on a deserted island some 12 kilometers northeast of the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, the source said.\"Around 10 buoys the North placed around the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea were swept away late last year,\" the source, who requested anonymity, said, referring to the de facto maritime border. \"But it is not moving yet to put them there again.\"Last May through June, the North put the buoys around the NLL, a flashpoint where three bloody naval skirmishes took place in 1999, 2002 and 2009. The exact reason why the North deployed the buoys remains unknown. But military authorities believe the North that did not have a high-tech naval monitoring system might have used them to identify the NLL.But late last year, the North built a 20-meter-high steel tower on Ari Island, an uninhabited island adjacent to Yeonpyeong Island and put a high-performance monitoring device on the tower. It also deployed some 30 personnel in charge of operating a radar system there. The new monitoring equipment might be the reason why the North did not try to reinstall the buoys near the sea border, a military official said.\"As the North has installed the new device that can keep close tabs on the movement along the NLL in the West Sea, it might have thought that there is no need to put the buoys again there,\" he said on condition of anonymity.In recent months, South Korean authorities have been reinforcing their monitoring activities near the border due to a spike in the number of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats catching crabs near the NLL. A daily average of around 380 boats including 140 North Korean vessels have been seen operating near the border, officials said.Military tensions have run high along the sea border as Pyongyang has persistently disputed the border on the grounds that it was drawn unilaterally by the then U.N.-led United Nations Command after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.The North has demanded that the NLL should be redrawn further south.

A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than 100 people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.The focus of the investigation will be on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Last week, the chief of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser's Korean unit made a formal apology and vowed to fully cooperate with South Korean authorities and conduct its own investigation to get to the bottom of the case.

North Korea's state media has not yet made public its leader's keynote address.Later in the day, the WPK's central committee will hold a session to review accomplishments and discuss future plans. On the final day of the event, it is expected to elect new members to the party central committee.North Korea is known to have invited some 120 foreign journalists to cover the party congress. But foreign news outlets said that the country did not allow them to go inside the convention center for news coverage.Analysts said that the gathering will serve as a venue to highlight Kim's one-man leadership, reshuffle top officials and unveil his vision for the defense and economic sectors.\"More than reaffirming his grip on power, it will serve as a coronation of the Kim Jong-un era,\" said Ken Gause, a senior analyst on North Korea at CNA Corp. in the United States.\u00a0 A picture made available on 06 May 2016 shows military personnel posing for a photograph before the portrait of Kim Il-sung during the Immortal Flower Festival `Kimilsungia` in Pyongyang, North Korea, 13 April 2016. (Yonhap)The party congress is being held amid high tensions as Pyongyang is threatening to conduct another nuclear test and launch of a ballistic missile in defiance of stronger U.N. sanctions.Since March, Pyongyang has fired off projectiles and ballistic missiles, warning that it is ready to carry out nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington.The North's leader has warned that his country is ready to conduct a nuclear warhead test and launch ballistic missiles \"in a short time.\"Pyongyang made three botched attempts to launch its Musudan intermediate-range missiles last month, a move which analysts say was aimed at building up the country's accomplishments in the runup to the party congress.The North's official Korean Central News Agency on Friday listed a set of the leaders' feats on its nuclear and missile programs including what it called the successful development of a small nuclear warhead which can be fitted onto a missile.Experts said that at the congress Kim is expected to defend his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting its moribund economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.\"There is a possibility that North Korea could adjust or refine the byeongjin policy,\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University.Other watchers said that the North may reaffirm the dual-track policy as the WPK's official party line.The current leader's father Kim Jong-il advocated a military-first, or \"songun,\" policy, highlighting the role of the military, but the young leader has shifted his focus to the WPK while promoting the byeongjin policy.In the face of tougher sanctions and pressure, the North had been pressing its people to work harder under a \"70-day campaign of loyalty\" and forcing them to offer money to the regime ahead of the major party event.\"Ordinary North Koreans are increasingly expressing complaints as the regime's labor mobilization has hampered their economic activities,\" said a government official.Pyongyang appears to be holding the political gathering without the attendance of high-profile foreign guests, since countries including China are presumed to have shunned it as the U.N. sanctions take hold, according to a Seoul official.A total of 177 delegates from 118 countries including China and Russia attended the sixth party congress held in 1980, South Korea's unification ministry said.

Security Council in March over its nuclear test and long-range rocket launch early this year.North Korea is poised to open the party congress later in the day, the first in 36 years, a move which analysts say will likely help Kim take a firmer hold on his already unfettered power.The event is the first party congress since October 1980 and also the first under the current leader, who assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il.The party congress, the WPK's highest-level political guidance body, comes amid nagging concerns about advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs.\"North Korea appears to seek to establish the socialist party-centered system and further consolidate the Kim Jong-un regime through the party congress,\" Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman at Seoul's unification ministry, said at a regular press briefing on Wednesday.The party congress, which may last for three to four days, will start off with an opening speech by Kim on Friday.

China backed tougher U.N. sanctions following the North's fourth nuclear test in January.\u00a0\"The outcome of sticking to nuclear development is very complicated. It has brought Pyongyang far more negative effects on its security than it may have predicted when it initiated its nuclear weapons program in the early years,\" the editorial reads.\u00a0\"Policymakers in the country must have realized how serious the issue is, and raised strategies to develop both the economy and nuclear technology at the same time. We may see how they have decided to resolve the contradictions between the two during this conference,\" it said.\u00a0\"It is not realistic to expect North Korea to make abrupt changes. The nation is also unlikely to stay exactly the same,\" it said.\u00a0\"It has a strong desire to get rid of its long-term isolation and sluggish economy, yet in the meantime, it is confused as to how to take the first step. It is believed that there will be pragmatic analysis during this meeting,\" it said.

An SNU professor surnamed Cho was detained without warrant Wednesday in connection to the case.The prosecution suspects that the professors allegedly received money from RB Korea in exchange for omitting some of the product\u2019s toxicity test results.

Dogs participating in a pet festival held at Gangwon Province run toward their owners on May 10. (Yonhap)It was in 1991 that the government first enacted the animal protection law, recognizing animals as those in need of protection and support. While the implementation of the law was relatively meager, it imposed penalties on those who physically abuse animals.The government has gradually toughened the punishment terms, imposing a one-year jail term or 10 million won ($8,660) fine since 2007. The animal protection law has also allowed authorities to temporarily restrict abusive owners from contacting their pets. In 2013, the government widened the definition of \u201canimal abuse\u201d from \u201cthe act of killing animals\u201d to \u201cany act that leads to the animal\u2019s death.\u201d \u201cThe change of regulations does not happen in a single day. It takes time and efforts. Although more progress is still needed, the regulations have greatly improved, compared to the first year when the government introduced the animal protection law,\u201d said Park So-yeon, president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth. Along with the move to prevent animal abuse, the government initiated the pet dog registration scheme to curb the number of abandoned dogs. The scheme requires pet dog owners to either hang an identification card tag on their pets\u2019 neck or insert a microchip that has the owner\u2019s information. The scheme, which started on a trial basis in 2007, was officially launched across the country in 2014. As of late 2014, about 8.9 million pet dogs were registered, which is estimated to be around half of the total pet dogs in the country, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\u2019 report last year, To boost welfare in line with the booming pet industry, the ministry launched a special task force in January this year. Comprised of 11 public officials, experts and activists, the team will come up with various measures by October to foster pet-related markets.They include having some 3,200 vet nurses -- the first time this occupation is being introduced in Korea -- and installing more pet funeral facilities. The ministry expects that more facilities will lower the funeral cost.The task force will also draw up clear monitoring criteria for running \u201cpet cafes\u201d -- cafes where visitors can play with pets. Despite the rise of such businesses, there are no specific monitoring rules over the management of pets.Their role will also involve establishing a blood donation system among pets that currently has no regulations, leading to hygiene issues.Along with the central government\u2019s efforts, municipalities are also better protecting animal rights. Seoul Metropolitan Government, for example, released a set of animal welfare measures last year.The city said it will appoint over 10,000 children and 1,000 adults to work as volunteers to monitor and report on animal abuse cases, while offering animal rights classes at schools.The city also said it would raise the number of pet playgrounds to five by 2020. Currently, only two are available in the city, with a new one slated to open early next year.

The economic achievement, for one, has been questioned by many here for allegedly being exaggerated, as often has been the case in past administrations and their sales diplomacy.The event had come amid heightening anticipation toward the promising Iranian market since international economic sanctions were lifted earlier this year from the Middle East country, following its earlier denuclearization deal.President Park Geun-hye talks to the press on her return flight from the Iran state visit on Wednesday. (Yonhap)\u201cThrough an advanced strategic relationship with Iran, we hope to trigger a second Middle East boom and eventually create new momentum for our nation\u2019s economy,\u201d Park told reporters Tuesday, local time, on the plane back to Seoul from Tehran.\u201cIn my meetings with Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, I have reconfirmed their strong will to cooperate with Korea in large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as new growth sectors such as medical care and energy.\u201dIn his briefing to the press, An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, had said on Monday, \u201cThe economic outcome triggered by the bilateral summit and the affiliated deals will amount to $45.6 billion in total,\u201d Cheong Wa Dae had earlier set the figure at $39.1 billion, describing it as a \u201cconservative\u201d estimation, but later explained that the amount could rise higher when reflecting the potential deals to a fuller extent.But among the 30 state-level projects cited as profitable, only six so far carry legal binding force while the rest remain in the initial stage of contracting, mostly memorandums of understanding.Iran\u2019s relatively placid attitude over the economic effects has added to the skepticism.\u201cWe should make attempts to achieve developed relations and increase cooperation (with South Korea) and remove the obstacles,\u201d Iran\u2019s official presidential website quoted its president as saying over the summit.While it described the two states\u2019 consensus to boost their trade volume initially to $18 billion and then to $30 billion, the Iranian government mentioned neither the total amount nor the individual order volume based on the signed memorandums. Meanwhile, as Park wrapped up her three-day state visit to Iran -- the first of its kind to take place since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1962 -- the president also underscored the progress made in regard to North Korea.\u201cIran has traditionally held amicable relations with North Korea,\u201d the president said.\u201cThe fact that it has clearly spoken out its stance (on denuclearization and peninsular peace) is an exceptional and significant move.\u201dHer remarks came amid speculation that the reclusive communist regime may implement a fifth nuclear test on Friday to mark the nationwide congress of its ruling Worker\u2019s Party.With the Iran summit behind her, President Park\u2019s imminent task is to meet with the leadership of leading political parties, as per her earlier pledge.\u201cI will meet with the leadership of the (top) three parties as soon as possible after my visit to Iran,\u201d the president said late last month in a meeting with the chief editors of local press.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which has been suffering a leadership vacuum since its crushing defeat in the April 13 general election, inaugurated journalist-turned-politician Chung Jin-suk as its new floor leader on Tuesday.The Minjoo Party of Korea decided to uphold the current interim leadership of Kim Chong-in until its national convention slated for late August or early September.The second biggest opposition party, the People\u2019s Party, has constituted its leadership, with former Minjoo senior Rep. Park Jie-won as floor leader.By displaying clout over the forthcoming legislature, President Park is hoping to pull up her approval ratings which hit a record-low in late April, in the weeks following the general election.According to local pollster Gallup Korea, Park\u2019s approval ratings stood at 30 percent from April 26-28, bouncing back from a record low of 29 percent in the previous week.By Bae Hyun-jung(tellme@heraldcorp.com)","526":"South Korean universities, which are worried about their futures due to dropping birthrates, are studying ways to make inroads abroad, local school sources said Monday. Ewha Womans University in Seoul recently disclosed its plan to branch out into the United States and China. National universities not in Seoul, which are dealing with an ever-falling number of entrants, are also showing deep interest in setting up schools in foreign countries. According to the Education Ministry, the number of high school seniors who want to enter college next year is estimated at 520,000, just 10,000 more than the entrance quota of 510,000 for all 386 universities and colleges nationwide.The problem is that the quota would have been far higher if not for the government's restructuring steps. Due to the nation's low birthrate, which was around 1.24 as of 2011, the number of students who will take college entrance tests is forecast to plummet to 470,000 in 2020, 430,000 in 2021, 410,000 in 2022 and 400,000 in 2023, according to the ministry's data. The estimate means that colleges will need to slash their current quotas by up to 110,000 overall over the next seven years. The ministry has already prepared to adjust the quota in stages based on the 2023 estimation. The ministry is also moving to introduce a massive restructuring program under which poorly performing colleges can be shut down. Under these harsh realities, survival has become a major issue in academic circles.Chungbuk National University in Cheonju, 137 kilometers south of Seoul, has recently attracted attention as a private education foundation in China's northern Shanxi province, which offered last month to set up a sister campus in the province's capital of Xian.The foundation also requested that the South Korean school run the campus. In addition, the foundation promised to build the campus and dormitories, and even recruit students. Early last month, the university also received a request to join a new international campus in the Chinese border town of Hunchun associated with Yanbian University, located in the Chinese province of Jilin. The Chinese university plans to complete the Hunchun campus by September 2017. In April, the private Mongolian International University also asked the Chungbuk university to jointly launch a branch school in Kazakhstan. This is not the first time that South Korean colleges have tried to make inroads into foreign countries. In fact, Chungnam National University in Daejeon, 164 kilometers south of Seoul, sought to set up a campus in Los Angeles in 2008 but had to call off the project two years later because of a domestic law banning such a step. But private universities will be allowed to set up campuses abroad starting next month as the related law was amended. The deregulation has led to private schools, including Ewha, actively studying ways to expand into foreign nations of late.

Korea, with its world-top level of information technology, hopes to become a reliable partner for Iran in this field.\u201dCheong Wa Dae also emphasized that the summit has elicited a record-high economic outcome by bridging South Korean export companies and local Iranian buyers.\u201cThe one-on-one business consultation meeting resulted in the clinching of 31 purchasing deals, worth $537 million in total,\u201d An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the individual business meetings on the previous day.During the state visit, Iran\u2019s top leaders also called for denuclearization, once again denying alleged military ties with the communist regime and thus stepping closer to partnership with South Korea.

It wasn't until 2011 that the products were taken off the shelves after mysterious deaths from lung complications were linked to the sterilizers. Oxy is accused of causing the greatest harm. South Korean government estimates say that of the 530 victims, 220 had used only Oxy products, while 184 had used both Oxy and other brands. Seventy of the deaths are believed to have been from using Oxy products.

(Yonhap)The ministry conducted the months-long nationwide survey on law schools since last year to find possibilities of nepotism after a lawmaker was accused of allegedly using his authority to have his son admitted to a law school late last year. The ministry probed some 6,000 cases of the past three years. It was the first-ever probe since the law school system was introduced in 2009.While Korean law schools have been welcomed as an alternative to widen opportunities to non-law major students and to raise diversity in the field, the admission system operated under schools\u2019 discretion has sparked criticisms over their lack of transparency. While admission is mostly determined by bar scores, English test scores, personal essays and interviews, the schools are not obligated to disclose how much each criteria is weighed in the admission, allowing leeway for schools to select student based on their preferences, according to critics.Disallowing applicants from revealing their family background has been considered one of the tools to prevent nepotism in school admissions.Lawyers were among those that criticized the law schools for lacking admission impartiality. \u201cThe fact that 24 cases were found in the past three years suggests that it is not a small figure. Even one irregularity in the admission process raises suspicion over the impartiality of the system,\u201d said the Korean Bar Association. The association is vocal against the repeal of the bar exam system to be replaced by law schools.Law professors vowed to take legal measures if necessary.\u201cThe problems of the current law school system are rampant in every step, from the admission process to grading system and graduation process. (The organization) will consider requesting information disclosure to schools or filing a public audit,\u201d said the Korea Law Professors Society.

The cancellation of the students\u2019 admission is also impossible, citing that it is not appropriate to divert the accountability of schools\u2019 mistakes to the students, it added. Regardless of the results, the ministry said it will start mandating that schools conduct blind admission processes. Only 18 out of 25 law schools across the country have voluntarily applied strict rules against revealing family background of the applicants. The Education Ministry also gave warnings to schools with lax admission rules.Public criticism also targeted the Education Ministry over its lack of monitoring and punishment. Some claimed that it has caught irregularities only based on whether the students revealed their family backgrounds in their essays, overlooking irregularities in other areas.\u201cThe ministry\u2019s announcement is only to cover up the irregularities. It is such an incompetent handling with no solutions provided,\u201d claimed KBA. \u201cRevealing family backgrounds in the opened-competition admission system fundamentally counters the Constitution and public sentiment.\u201d Some claimed that using family backgrounds in the admission process arouses negative public sentiment in Korea due to its unique culture. \u201cThe Korean traditional collectivism culture has commonly led people to compare with others over their social status and to be interested in others\u2019 social positions.

Hundreds of victims also plan to lodge a collective suit against the company later this month.The snowballing case has also come under the radar of President Park Geun-hye, who urged prosecutors to thoroughly investigate the case. The repeated apology, however, was not enough to solace those who have long suffered from unidentified diseases.Jung Mi-ae accompanied her 14-year-old son, who is undersized, wheelchair-bound and wore a nasal cannula connected to a green oxygen tank to aid his breathing. \"Do you think you can compensate my son's pain and suffering?,\"the 40-year-old from Yongin, south of Seoul, said. \"My son has never been able to attend school because of his health condition.\"\"Why didn't you apologize in the first place?

An estimated 80,000 laborers belonging to the nation\u2019s two biggest umbrella trade unions \u2013 Federation of Korean Trade Unions and Korean Confederation of Trade Unions -- participated in demonstrations in 15 cities. The unionized workers called for a withdrawal of labor reform plans which they see as making it easier for employers to dismiss workers, expanding low-quality and temporary jobs in the labor market. South Korean workers participate in a rally to mark May Day in Daehakno, Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)The proposed bills, which have been pending at the National Assembly for seven months, would extend the hiring of irregular workers and expand sectors in which companies can use temporary workers. The government is promoting the bills to boost the slowing economy and create more jobs, especially for the youth and the elderly. It also presented administrative guidelines to ease restrictions for employers to fire underperforming workers and change company rules without unions\u2019 approval. The unions fear that the guidelines would prompt more employers to adopt a performance-based wage system. At Seoul Square in front of the City Hall, some 30,000 unionists from the FKTU staged a rally from 1 p.m. and marched about 2 kilometers across the downtown area. The May Day rally, which is usually packed with older workers, drew thousands of young people. They chanted, \u201cLet\u2019s fight against the evil bill and put up placards reading \u201cOpposition to easier dismissals,\u201d \u201cStop labor market reforms\u201d and \u201cImmediately abolish the government\u2019s guidelines.\u201d \u201cThe government is pushing for easier lay-offs, pay cuts and creation of irregular workers under the name of labor market reforms,\u201d Kim Dong-man, chief of the FKTU, said in an opening speech.Kim also urged the government to scrap the state-led restructuring for the declining shipping and ship building industry. \u201cRestructuring sacrifices only laborers, causing massive lay-offs and wage reductions. Conglomerates responsible for mismanagement should be blamed for the current situation and economic crises, not laborers.\u201dThe financial authorities released its plan to restructure the country\u2019s shipbuilding and shipping sectors suffering from massive losses in the wake of diminishing global demands and competition from Chinese rivals. The government demands major shipping companies such as Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine, Hanjin Shipping and Hyundai Heavy Industries sell assets, cut workforce and wages and streamline their business plans in return for financial aids. In Daehakno, some 15,000 unionists from the second-largest umbrella union KCTU held a rally against the government-led market reforms and restructuring plan. They marched about 3.3 kilometers from Jongno 5-ga to near Gwanghwamun Square following the rally. \"Restructuring and mass lay-offs are to redeem the capitalists and government, while shifting the responsibility for economic crisis to laborers,\u201d said Choi Jong-jin, an acting head of the KCTU. \u201cWhat we need now is job sharing, pro-hiring policies.\u201dThe KCTU vowed to stage an all-out strike in early July to \u201cguarantee basic labor rights\u201d and \u201cstop restructuring measures.\u201dSome 200 migrant workers and their supporters were among the KCTU unionists holding a rally in central Seoul. They called for abolishment of the Employment Permit System which does not allow foreign laborers to move their workplaces. \u201cOur struggle against the government\u2019s oppression on migrant workers continues because the government\u2019s attitude has not changed at all,\u201d said Udaya Rai, president of the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants\u2019 Trade Union.\u201cThe government should revise its Employment Permit System if it wanted to stop migrant workers from turning into unregistered employees rather than crack down on them. They contribute more to Korea than they receive from the government. Let\u2019s fight in unity.\u201d Among the 18.4 million workers in South Korea, 1.9 million of them have joined either the FKTU or KCTU, meaning that the two unions represent 10.3 percent of the Korean workers in the country, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.The May Day rallies came amid heightened wrangling in the political realm over passage of the market reform bills, with the ruling Saenuri Party having lost its majority at the National Assembly in the April 13 parliamentary election. While President Park Geun-hye administration remains determined to pass the market reform bills through the parliament, the opposition parties pledged to block them. In a statement to mark May Day, the right-wing Saenuri Party said that the political parties should join forces to push for labor market reforms, citing the sluggish economy and youth unemployment. Left-leaning The Minjoo Party of Korea said in a statement: \u201c(The) Park Geun-hye administration is attempting to push the laborers to the corner even further through labor reforms. It is an old-fashioned economic theory to revive economy at the expense of laborers.\u201dThe centrist People\u2019s Party said, on the other hand, that the government needs to seek a \u201cbroad consensus\u201d from the public before pushing for labor market reforms. \u201cThe government argues that restructuring and labor market reforms can solve the economic crisis, but that is not necessarily true.\u201d By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","544":"Tens of thousands of unionized workers will hold rallies across the country to criticize the government's labor reform plans that they say will make firing people easier, the nation's two largest umbrella unions said Saturday.On Sunday, 50,000 members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) will stage protests in 15 cities to urge the government to nullify the agreement made in September between management and labor representatives.The trilateral deal allows companies to dismiss workers who are negligent or underperforming and has been pending approval by the National Assembly's Environment and Labor Committee. Once the standing committee endorses the bill, it will undergo a parliamentary vote at the next plenary session. KCTU says the deal provides a license for management to fire workers on a whim and retaliate against union activities.Another umbrella union, the Federation of Korea Trade Unions (FKTU), said 30,000 of its members will hold demonstrations at Seoul Plaza on Sunday afternoon. The workers will march across downtown Seoul after the rally. South Korean workers mark Labor Day on May 1.Protesters will also demand raising the minimum wage to 10,000 won (US$8.73) from the current 6,030 won and creating jobs that require a 35-hour work week.The rallies will likely paralyze traffic in Seoul and other major cities, authorities said, adding they will station nearly 1,000 officers across the country to manage traffic congestion.Authorities advise residents to note protest venues in advance and use public transportation to avoid traffic.

China has strongly opposed the possible THAAD deployment, claiming the system, especially its radar, could be used against it, despite repeated U.S. assurances that it is only aimed at defending against threats from North Korea. Asked whether THAAD's deployment to the South could affect China's pressure on the North, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said, \"It shouldn't.\"\"The THAAD battery would be oriented to the threat in North Korea, not oriented to China in any way,\" Earnest said at a regular briefing.Earnest also said that China is also concerned about the North's behavior.\"The point is China using its influence on the North Korean government to get them to end their provocative acts is not something that they do as a favor to the United States,\" he said, adding that getting Pyongyang to end provocations is rooted in China's self-interest.\"Having all of this provocative behavior and this conflict and this destabilizing activity on their doorstep is not in their interest,\" he said.Earnest also stressed that the U.S. commitment to South Korea's defense is \"rock solid.\"\"We have seen repeated provocations, particularly in just the last few months, from North Korea vowing to use their military might against our allies,\" he said. The assessment of military and national security experts is that additional resources could be necessary to ensure the safety and security of the South, and that's why the U.S. has engaged in consultations with Seoul about THAAD deployment, he said.Earnest said, however, that it is ultimately up to the South to\u00a0 decide whether to accept THAAD deployment.\"We would defer to the preferences of our allies in South Korea about whether or not they would like to have this additional equipment located on their territory. The assessment of our military and national security experts is that it could be a good idea for them to do that,\" he said.\"Ultimately this is a sovereign country and because they're anally of the United States, we're looking for ways to help them. And this is one potential way we could offer some assistance to them and enhance their security. But ultimately, they would make the final call,\" he added. (Yonhap)","546":"The Foreign Ministry denied speculation Friday that the heads of two South Korea-based international organizations battling climate change have offered to resign due in part to Seoul's lack of attention to an environmental agenda.Yvo de Boer, director general of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), and Hela Cheikrouhou, executive director of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), have offered to step down. Their decisions spawned speculation that they might have felt unhappy that the climate change issue is not a policy priority for Seoul, whereas the preceding government had prioritized it.Stressing that the two leaders opted to resign because of \"personal reasons,\" the ministry said that Seoul has made \"active efforts\" to provide financial contributions and other support to both the GGGI and GCF -- headquartered in Seoul and Incheon, respectively.\"The GGGI director-general has stated to the members (of theorganization) that he offered to resign strictly for personal reasons,\" the ministry said in a press release, noting that his replacement will be picked through an international recruitment process. Yvo de Boer began his four-year term in April 2014 and is set to leave office on Sept. 30.The GCF executive director's three-year term is due to expire in September, and she has not applied to serve for another term, the ministry said. The fund is to pick a new chief in its key conference slated for June.The ministry underscored that since 2013, Seoul has contributed $10 million to the GGGI annually -- the largest amount among its 26 members. It also said that Seoul spearheaded the efforts to raise the initial fund worth $10.3 billion to operate the GCF.

The quake was the biggest to hit the country since 1979, when a temblor killed some 600 people and injured around 20,000.Yoo will pay for all costs needed to produce, transport and install the four works out of his own pocket. The two sets of \"The Greeting Man\" will be installed facing each other in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito, with the two sets of \"The Mirror Man,\" a sculpture of a giant man, will be erected face-to-face with fingers touching in the neighboring city of Cayambe.\u00a0He hoped that \"The Mirror Man\" sculptures will serve \"as a symbol that puts together the southern and northern hemispheres of the global village in the country which lies smack in the middle of the equator.\" He added that the statues will hopefully contribute to the friendship and goodwill between South Korea and Ecuador.The sculptures are expected to be shipped from the port of Busan in August and installed in the latter part of this year.Yoo and the Ecuadorian authorities are planning the artwork dedication for either Oct. 5, the anniversary of the establishment of Seoul-Quito diplomatic ties, or Dec. 6, the founding day of the Ecuadorian capital.He said he is greatly honored to be able to install his work in Ecuador, adding he will continue \"The Greeting Man\" installation project in the latter part of this year, with the next venue possibly in Brazil.

It marks a sharp rise from 4,067 units posted in 2010. \"Previously, policies on promoting the return-to-farm movement were aimed at providing information and individual-level education,\" Lee said. \"But now, we plan to add vitality to the national and regional economy on the back of the latest trend.\"The ministry added it will provide customized support to South Koreans dreaming of starting a new life on farms.\"South Korea is facing challenges in economic development due to the sluggish growth and consumption, coupled with high unemployment,\" Lee said, adding that revitalizing the rural economies is a solution to the prolonged economic slump.\"The South Korean government plans to establish a system in which people can get access to various information and subsidies that can help them better settle on farms.\" (Yonhap)","549":"A local daily reported Friday that poor life vest design caused the deaths of four soldiers six years ago. According to the report, the life vest used by soldiers during a boat drill in Hangang River was designed to have higher buoyance on the back than the front, which led to the device forcing the soldiers\u2019 face under water.The Ipo irrigation pool at the southern stretch of Hangang River in Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi Province. (Yonhap)The daily claimed that investigation report obtained from the Army headquarters said that the November 2010 accident of four drownings at the Ipo irrigation pool in Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi Province, was\u00a0due to the faulty design of the life jacket the soldiers wore at the time. The report read, \u201cIf the soldiers lost consciousness while being swept in the current, it can be presumed their centroid was tilted to their torso, which could have submerged their heads under water.\u201d \u201cThere appears to be a need for a thorough research to improve the life jackets.\u201d When the boat capsized during the military drill, the soldiers were swept away in the current and were later found drowned with their backs turned up facing the sky. The floatable jackets they wore had 55 percent buoyancy on the back and 45 percent on the chest. The military is being accused of allegedly covering up the faulty life jackets to avoid taking responsibility for the death of the four soldiers. A military insider, whose identity was withheld to protect the source, said in an interview with the local daily that the reason the life jackets were designed in such a manner was due to misconstrued notion that it would allow the soldiers to always maintain a front-facing posture. Unlike the army life jackets, the navy\u2019s kapok life jackets have extra buoyancy at the front, with only one-third of chest buoyancy at the back.\u00a0 The insider claimed the jackets were not the direct cause of soldiers\u2019 drowning, however the incident has served as a trigger to run a check on safety gears and improve on them. \u201cThe buoyancy was corrected so that the chest would have 10 percent higher buoyancy than the back.\u201dThe military will distribute the new life jackets to each military unit by the end of this year. A budget of 1.7 billion won ($1.5 million) was allocated to the military for this.By Lim Jeong-yeo (kaylalim@heraldcorp.com)","550":"North Korea has heightened surveillance along its border with China and beefed up monitoring of its people ahead of the ruling party's congress next week, a source familiar with North Korea affairs said Friday.With the North's rare party congress a week away, the country has moved to restrict the entry of people into its capital city of Pyongyang, according to the source, who declined to be identified.It has also ordered North Koreans not to conduct even key ceremonial events, such as weddings and funerals, the insider said, adding that the government is keeping closer tabs on its people.North Korea has set a 'special surveillance period' by limiting entry into the capital and increasing vigilance along the border area with China,\" the source said.The move appears to be aimed at creating an atmosphere of fear ahead of the party event as the North's regime is seeking to prevent its people from fleeing the nation. The measures can help clamp down on crime.The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) plans to open its first party congress in more than three decades next Friday. It is widely expected to help North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reaffirm his tight grip on power.It will be the first party congress since October 1980 and also the first under the regime of leader Kim who assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il.The source said that the country is imposing stronger punishments on those who refuse to follow orders by police during the surveillance period.\"As security officials can take higher bribes during the crackdown, they are excessively monitoring ordinary North Koreans in a heavy-handed manner,\" he said.South Korea's unification ministry said that the North appears to have tightened border control and heightened surveillance of its people as the repressive regime has done so far whenever major party events are held.\"North Korea seems to have increased its vigilance in areas, including Pyongyang,\" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing. \"The move appears to be aimed at raising security for smooth preparation of the upcoming party congress.\"The party congress, the WPK's highest-level political guidance body, comes amid nagging concerns about advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs.North Korea has been mobilizing ordinary citizens to prepare for the congress under the \"70-day campaign of loyalty\" and forced them to offer money to authorities, inviting growing discontent from North Koreans.Using the alias Kim Sung-woo, a 66-year-old North Korean defector told Yonhap News Agency that the North had conducted rigorous medical checkups on those who joined the sixth party congress back in 1980.Kim, a former North Korean military official, participated in the party event at that time.He said that the North was worried about athlete's foot on soldiers' hands over concerns that Kim Il-sung, the North's founder, and his son Kim Jong-il could be infected when they shook hands with participating soldiers.\"North Korean soldiers with low social status pulled out their fingernails that had athlete's foot with pincers to take part in the key party event,\" the defector said.The defector added that the party congress was regarded by low-ranking military officials as the best chance for promotion through a meeting with the Kims.

Fueling the debate was the suggestion from U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump that South Korea and Japan could be allowed to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce American burdens in protecting the allies.\"That debate has reemerged in South Korea as a result of North Korea's provocations. President Park (Geun-hye) was very clear in statements that she has made that that is not the path that South Korea should or will take, at least under her administration,\"Blinken said during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. \"And we've tried to make clear to our allies and partners that it is not necessary because to put it colloquially, we have their back with the nuclear umbrella and with every other means that we have to come to their defense.\"Blinken also noted that the U.S. and the South have begun formal consultations on the potential deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to the South to better defend against threats from the North.\"We've been building up the defenses including for our partners and allies and of course, we've also been going very hard at the North Koreans on the nuclear missile program,\" he said. (Yonhap)","552":"North Korea fired off what appeared to be a mid-range ballistic missile late Thursday, hours after it carried out a similar launch, but both attempts seem to have ended in failure, the South Korean military said.North Korea launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), presumed to be a Musudan, at around 7:26 p.m. near its eastern city of Wonsan, according to Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff.It said the missile probably blew up midflight.The move came on the heels of the North launching the same type of missile at 6:40 a.m. Thursday. This missile is known to have crashed a few seconds into its flight.The back-to-back launches on the same day marked the second and third times that Pyongyang has tested a Musudan, or BM-25, missile in less than two weeks.North Korea made its first botched attempt to launch the Musudan missile on April 15, the birthday of North Korean founding father Kim Il-sung. The launch ended in what experts called a catastrophic failure, reportedly due to engine problems.The North's three consecutive failed tests indicate the unreliability of the communist country's IRBM capability.With a targeted range of 3,000-4,000 kilometers, the missiles are designed to reach as far as Guam, where a large number of United States military forces are stationed. Pyongyang presumably wants to arm these missiles with nuclear warheads that they may be developing.North Korea is believed to have deployed some 50 Musudan missiles since 2007.The North's missile tests came as the North's ruling Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) is preparing to hold its first party congress in more than three decades on May 6.The party congress is widely expected to serve as a venue to help North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reaffirm his grip on power at a time when his country is struggling to tackle tougher U.N. sanctions.The North's failed tests are likely to irritate the North's leader who has threatened to conduct a nuclear warhead explosion test and launch ballistic missiles \"in a short time,\" analysts say.They said that the failed launches may provide a greater incentive for North Korea to conduct a nuclear test ahead of the country's party congress in order to save face.

He was asymptomatic until April 20, when he developed mild, cold-like symptoms including fever. He visited a local clinic in Seoul that day, but his doctor did not see him as a potential Zika virus patient. YonhapHe visited a general hospital on April 23, as he started experiencing skin rashes. Medical staff at the hospital reported him as a suspected Zika virus patient the same day. His test results, which became available Wednesday, turned out to be positive. He is currently in a stable condition and has been hospitalized for more examinations. State epidemiologists are also investigating the case. South Korea reported its first Zika virus case last month -- a 43-year-old man who was bitten by infected mosquitoes during his visit to Brazil from Feb.17-March 9. Just like the second patient, he also experienced skin rashes on top of mild symptoms such as fever and muscle pain. Currently, all doctors nationwide have been asked by the Health Ministry to report any patient who has visited a Zika virus-affected country and has any of the following symptoms: fever, muscle pain, headache or conjunctivitis. Health authorities plan to include skin rashes to the list as both reported patients suffered this symptom, the ministry said.The World Health Organization in February issued a worldwide warning that the Zika virus is a global public health emergency that requires a united response.

It said 36 were from bodybuilding, three from swimming and one each from weightlifting, wrestling, golf and para-archery.The WADA said there were 1,693 anti-doping violations overall by athletes and athlete support personnel from 109 nations in 83 sports.Russia ranked first with 148 positive tests, followed by Italy with 123, India with 96 and Belgium and France tied with 91.By sports, athletics yielded the most positive drug tests with 228, with bodybuilding a close second with 225 and cycling with 168.The WADA said 217,762 blood and urine samples were analyzed in 2014 by WADA-accredited laboratories. (Yonhap)","557":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is likely to use next week's party congress as an occasion to reaffirm his unfettered power at a time when the isolated country is struggling to tackle tougher U.N. sanctions, experts predicted.North Korea said Wednesday that the Workers' Party of Korea will open its first congress in more than three decades next Friday. Seoul's unification ministry expected the event to run for four to five days.It will be the first party congress since October 1980 and also the first under the regime of leader Kim who assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il.The party congress, the highest-level political guidance body, comes amid nagging concerns about advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs.Analysts said that the upcoming event will serve as a venue to highlight Kim's one-man leadership, reshuffle top officials and unveil his visions for the defense and economic sectors.\"More than reaffirming his grip on power, it will serve as a coronation of the Kim Jong-un era,\" said Ken Gause, a senior analyst on North Korea at CNA Corp. in the United States.North Korea has intensified the personality cult of the current leader since its January nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch the following month. Kim is believed to have strengthened his reign of terror by executing more than 100 officials to take a firm grip on power.The congress is widely expected to entail a major reshuffle of top officials, which may include the country's ceremonial leader Kim Yong-nam, experts said.\"The congress will lay the groundwork for Kim Jong-un to prove his legitimacy as the sole leader,\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.The party congress comes amid high tensions as Pyongyang is threatening to conduct another nuclear test and launch another long-range missile in defiance of stronger U.N. sanctions.In March, the U.N. Security Council slapped tougher sanctions on North Korea as punishment for its nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year.Since last month, Pyongyang has fired off projectiles and ballistic missiles, warning that it is ready to wage nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington.Experts said that at the congress, the North's leader is expected to defend his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting its moribund economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.Kim did not make a reference to his dual-track policy during his New Year's message on Jan. 1, but just five days later the North conducted its fourth nuclear test.\"There is a possibility that North Korea could adjust or refine the byeongjin policy,\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University.There is growing speculation that North Korea could carry out a fifth nuclear test ahead of the party congress. Seoul and Washington have warned of stronger sanctions if the North makes additional provocations.\"I think there is a good chance for additional weapons demonstrations,\" Gause said, adding that the North's leader needs his \"bona fides\" as a national security leader.\"Since the failure of his diplomacy campaign has made it impossible for him to show progress on the economy, he has no choice but to demonstrate to the country that he can keep it safe by ensuring its deterrent,\" he said.Touching on the economy, experts said that the North is likely to unveil new economic policies at the congress in a bid to flesh out the leader's plan to boost the country's fragile economy.Since Kim inherited power in late 2011, the North's economy has posted marginal growth with its marketplaces noticeably expanding.North Korea's economy is estimated to have grown 1 percent in 2014, similar to a 1.1 percent on-year gain the previous year, according to South Korea's central bank. It posted economic growth for the fourth straight year in 2014 after contracting in 2009 and 2010.In 2012, the North announced the so-called \"6.28 measures\" that centered on allowing farmers to keep 30 percent of their production quota plus any excess over the quota. In 2014, it unveiled a new set of reforms that call for raising the farmers' portion to 60 percent.\"As the North has claimed its success in producing achievements on the fronts of ideology, politics and the military for a strong and thriving nation, it will focus on propping up the economy,\" said Kim Young-hee, an expert on the North Korean economy at Korea Development Bank.But a Seoul government official said if the sanctions are put in place for a long time, the North's economy is not likely to recover due to a shortage of dollars and products.\u00a0Meanwhile, analysts shared mixed views about whether or not the North will launch a charm offensive toward Seoul after the party congress.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that there is a low chance that the North would make a conciliatory gesture toward South Korea amid standoffs sparked by the North's nuke and missile provocations.The Seoul government said the North could propose bilateral talks with the United States including talks about a peace treaty.North Korea has recently called for talks about a peace treaty with Washington to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended in an armistice leaving the two Koreas technically locked in a state of war.But Seoul and Washington have dismissed the idea as a ploy to divert attention away from the North's nuclear aspirations.

(Yonhap)","559":"North Korea could conduct another nuclear test before a key party congress early next month, to show off its \"full nuclear weapon status\" and bolster its leader Kim Jong-un's legitimacy, a prominent U.S. expert said Wednesday.In an interview with reporters, Victor Cha, senior North Korea analyst at the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, also noted the \"secondary sanctioning\" to punish third-country entities doing business with the North would be the most impactful measure that can be imposed in the event of Pyongyang's fifth nuclear test.\"It wouldn't surprise me if we saw a fifth nuclear test before the party congress. But I do think that most of the sorts of provocations are largely going to be only WMD-type provocations,\" he said on the sidelines of the Asan Plenum 2016, an annual forum hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\"I think the driver of these provocations is a desire to demonstrate to their own people and to the world that they have achieved a full nuclear weapon status before the party congress to give legitimacy to Kim Jong-un.\"Pyongyang is gearing up to hold the rare congress of its ruling Workers' Party starting May 6, a crucial political gathering in which Kim is expected to flaunt the communist regime's political, military, ideological and economic achievements, and put forward the country's future direction.Depicting the North Korean leader as being \"unpredictable and showing little restraint,\" the scholar said should Pyongyang press ahead with another nuclear test, the \"secondary sanctioning\" that could potentially target Chinese companies will have the \"most impact.\"He pointed out that although Washington has set up the authority for the third-country sanctions following the North's fourth nuclear test in January, it has yet to exercise the authority that would put great pressure on the wayward regime.\"They set up the authority that they haven't exercised yet. I think after a fifth nuclear test, they will exercise that authority even if it is against Chinese companies,\" he said.Referring to the concerns that the sanctioning of Chinese companies would undermine relations between Washington and Beijing, Cha claimed that the secondary sanctioning would not be a \"big deal.\"\u00a0He said only small Chinese companies that do business with the North would be subject to the sanctions given that most of the big Chinese companies have already suspended transactions with the North.\"I know everybody makes a big deal about the secondary sanctioning, but I really don't think it is going to be that difficult,\" he said.Touching on the North Korean leader scrambling to establish his governing legitimacy, Cha said that the isolated state is now caught in a \"legitimacy spiral\" in which the unpredictable leader is exploring ways to build his political credentials based on the nuclear power or economic development.\"North Korea may want to base the legitimacy of Kim Jong-un on economic growth, the quality of life, but they have been unsuccessful in doing that. So they increasingly need to rely on the nuclear weapons as a primary matrix for legitimacy,\" he said.\"But the more they rely on nuclear weapons, the more sanctions they will get, which makes it harder for them to do economic development, which means they need to focus more on their nuclear weapons.\"Portraying the spread of private market places in the North as the \"single most important change\" that has ever happened over the past two decades, Cha warned that Pyongyang would face a \"severe\" reaction should it move to control it.He pointed out that the growing private economy is a double-edged sword as it could help sustain the impoverished country but could pose a \"destabilizing\" challenge to the despotic regime.

She also warned of stronger sanctions against Pyongyang.\"We're going to look at other options as we move forward if North Korea continues with this kind of behavior,\" State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner said at a regular briefing in response to a question about possible consequences Pyongyang could face in case of a nuclear test.\u00a0\"As North Korea continues to make decisions that we believe are counterproductive, we've got to also continue to look at what our options in terms of response, and both one to ensure the security and safety of our allies and protect the security of the peninsula, but also to make every effort to convince North Korea to come back to serious discussions about its program,\" he said.Toner declined to elaborate on what other options could be, saying he doesn't want to \"announce anything before it's been fully formed and fully vetted.\" Still, he said the U.S. goal is two-fold: how to put additional pressure on the North to make it return to the negotiating table and how to ensure our allies are protected.\"We call on North Korea to refrain from actions that further destabilize the region and focus on what it needs to do, which is take concrete steps toward fulfilling its comments and its obligations to denuclearize,\" Toner said.\u00a0\"The United States remains steadfast in its commitment to the security of the peninsula and to its allies, the defense of its allies, and we're going to continue to coordinate with Japan, with South Korea and other allies and partners,\" he said.Toner also urged China to exercise influence with the North.White House press secretary Josh Earnest also said the U.S. will continue to ramp up the pressure on the North and continue to work closely with the Chinese government, saying Beijing has more influence with the North Korean government than any other country in the world.\"We're going to continue to make clear that the path that North Korea must choose to rejoin the international community is one that involves them committing to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and come into compliance with their international obligations,\" Earnest said.Concerns have grown bigger that Pyongyang could carry out yet another nuclear test just a few months after its fourth test in an effort to project an image of Kim Jong-un as a strong leader in the lead-up to the Workers' Party Congress next month.Earlier in the day, the Institute for Science and International Security said in a report that activity at North Korea's nuclear test site has significantly decreased in a possible indication that the communist nation has completed all preparations for a fifth nuclear test.

The aim of the project is to ultimately root out what they said was the fundamental cause of Korea\u2019s excessive private education burden, according to the organization.Yonhap\u201cThe fundamental cause of the burden of private education is not the education itself, but social problems such as the admission system of colleges or the way the job market works. Most parents recognize that there is discrimination among schools in the recruitment process,\u201d said organization head Song In-soo. \u201cAs the largest hurdle for students and job seekers tends to be academic background, individuals invest money and time to getting admission into prestigious schools. Students consequently attempt to follow the elite academic cycle of going to an English kindergarten, private elementary school, international middle school and elite high school,\u201d he said. According to government statistics office Statistics Korea\u2019s annual survey from 2009 to 2013, the majority of the respondents picked the \u201cimportance of a school\u2019s name value in the job market\u201d as the reason for spending money on private education.The grade-oriented admission system of elite schools and the prevalent culture of ranking schools stood at second and third, respectively. While carrying out the signature-collecting campaign with 100,000 individuals to seek the anti-academic elitism law, the organization will receive reports of any discrimination cases and monitor the recruitment processes of the public sector, it added. It will also try to dissuade the media from covering rankings of schools. The group, also known as World Without Worries About Private Education, has been preparing for the campaign launch since 2014 through a series of discussions, surveys and studies on the school discrimination ban.

They include the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks for secondary school students, the comfort women deal struck between South Korea and Japan and passage of labor market reform bills and an antiterrorism bill. The radically conservative group has also stirred the pot by staging rallies against the families of victims of the Sewol ferry disaster, blasting them for politicizing the Sewol ferry issue and being North Korean sympathizers.According to local news reports and legal industry sources, the group had received about 520 million won ($450,000) from the Federation of Korean Industries to orchestrate pro-government rallies between 2012 and 2014.Members of the Korea Parent Federation collide with activists participating in a regular rally held in front of the comfort women statue in Seoul on Jan. 6. (Yonhap)The FKI -- a private interest group representing the nation\u2019s big businesses like Samsung and LG -- wired the money to the parents\u2019 group through a bank account under the name of the now-defunct Bethel Missionary Foundation, the report claimed. The missionary group is thought to be a \u201cpaper company\u201d to funnel the money. The FKI has remained silent, refusing to confirm whether it provided funds to the parents\u2019 group. Part of the money was allegedly spent on giving 1,259 North Korean defectors 20,000 won each to participate in some 39 rallies held by the group, weekly magazine Sisa Journal reported last week.It also suggested that Heo Hyun-joon, a low-ranking official at Cheong Wa Dae, had asked the secretary general of the KPF to hold a demonstration in support of President Park\u2019s settlement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the wartime sexual enslavement last year. Cheong Wa Dae repeatedly denied its alleged meddling in hosting such pro-government rallies by the parents\u2019 group. Heo sought a court injunction Friday to ban the sale of the weekly magazine and filed a complaint against Sisa Journal and its reporter demanding compensation. He also asked the Press Arbitration Commission correct the reports.\u00a0\u00a0 The National Intelligence Service is also suspected of influencing the right-wing group to sway public opinion in favor of President Park during the 2012 presidential election.

(123RF)According to big data analyst company Daumsoft, its research on 700 million blog posts and 8.9 billion tweets by Koreans on the topic of marriage between Jan. 1, 2011, and April 20, 2016, showed an abrupt surge in the use of the word beginning from 2015.While in the four years between 2011 and 2014 the volume remained around 2,500 to 3,000, in 2015 it suddenly rocketed to 13,037 and escalated to 19,730 in the first four months of 2016. Bihon, a neologism that signifies a person\u2019s choice to remain unmarried, is often contrasted with a similar sounding word \u201cmihon,\u201d which merely states that a person is single without indicating his or her intentions.Daumsoft said that Koreans are increasingly viewing marriage as an option and not a requirement in life, amid the economic slump and rising unemployment rate.Along with the rise of \u201cbihon,\u201d words with negative connotations such as \u201cstress\u201d tripled in online conversations in 2015 compared to four years ago. Other such words were \u201ceconomic burden,\u201d \u201cpracticality\u201d and \u201crealistic.\u201dNeologism such as \u201cwedding-poor,\u201d referring to people who feel financially pinched after spending a staggering sum of money on their wedding ceremony also rose in use.

Security Council resolution has a provision on this issue,\" China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. \"We hope the relevant party can earnestly fulfill the resolution and avoid taking any actions that may escalate tension.\"North Korea's state media claimed on Saturday that the North successfully launched a ballistic missile from a submarine in what Pyongyang argued is a success of its underwater launching system.The U.N.

Questions, however, persist over the direction of the investigation, the current legal system and the government\u2019s role in the tragedy that has led to more than 200 deaths allegedly caused by using the products.\u201cWe are going to help them with practical compensation, by discussing with representatives of the victims group within this week,\u201d an official from the special probe team was quoted as saying.A group of protesters participate in a campaign to boycott Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products calling for corporate punishment for the firms behind toxic humidifier disinfectants during a press conference in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)Park Ki-ho, a male victim\u2019s father, told The Korea Herald, \u201cWe decided to work with lawyers from the Lawyers for a Democratic Society and we will strive to get our voice heard until the firms (responsible for toxic humidifier disinfectants) apologize in front of us.\u201d Victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectant agreed Sunday in a closed-door meeting to push ahead with a group litigation. Victims and their families also decided to promote the boycott of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products. According to the prosecution, the special probe team is set to summon four executives of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- including former CEO Shin Hyun-woo -- on Tuesday. Shin headed the firm in 2001 when it started selling the disputed humidifier disinfectant. Last week, the prosecution reconfirmed the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s report that there is a significant association between the health impacts and the use of Oxy\u2019s humidifier disinfectant.The KCDCP in 2011 had submitted a report that the use of humidifier disinfectant can cause serious health damage.However, the company submitted its own 77-page report last month to refute this, saying the deaths may have been triggered by other factors such as yellow dust in spring. The prosecution argued that the newly submitted report has \u201clow credibility.\u201dOxy\u2019s PR agency Prain Global told The Korea Herald that the firm\u2019s additional report was in line with \u201cearnest cooperation with all investigations and steps to pursue a solution.\u201dExperts voiced concern that it could take several years to figure out whether the deaths of disinfectant users were due to yellow dust as claimed by the company. They would need to conduct additional tests to figure out the correlation or redo the toxicity test for the use of disputed humidifier disinfectant. According to the Korea Institute of Toxicology, experiment on toxic chemicals and its health impacts normally takes 24 to 36 months to ensure the accuracy of the test.\u201cExperiments to test harmful chemicals or carcinogenic substances on animals take at least two years. Chemicals that are tested by inhalation (such as humidifier disinfectant) may especially take longer with more detailed processes, with at least 1 billion won ($870,400) as experiment fee,\u201d an official from KIT told The Korea Herald. Prain Global said it cannot check whether Oxy will conduct another toxicity test on its disputed humidifier disinfectant. Experts also criticized the weak legal basis to punish the companies, as well as the government\u2019s unsystematic reaction to the incident. Current law has no stipulation to punish companies responsible for huge loss of lives.In July 2015, some 800 civilians signed and submitted a legislation petition to the National Assembly in order to penalize companies who do not follow due civic and crime responsibility.In 2014, when the sinking of the Sewol ferry left 304 dead or missing, then-ship operator Cheonghaejin Marine Co. was only fined 10 million won for an oil spill. The prosecution last week summoned officials from Oxy\u2019s marketing team to question them over false advertising and for claiming that its products are \u201c99 percent sterilized and not harmful even to children.\u201d\u201cIt is quite a light punishment for Oxy to just get penalized for false advertising, which can amount to a maximum of 150 million won in fines,\u201d lawyer Hwang Kyung-hwa told The Korea Herald.\u201cThe Environment Ministry designated more than 200 patients to just one hospital in Seoul, which takes about three years per patient to check if their health damages are related to the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant. Even before the cause of their health damage is confirmed, the statute of limitation against firms behind the toxic disinfectants will lapse,\u201d she added.On Monday, Rep. Jang Ha-na from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea contended that local chemical manufacturer SK Chemical should be held responsible as well for producing and selling PHMG, saying that \u201cthe firm was aware of the toxicity of the chemical when inhaled.\u201d\u201cSK Chemical should step up and take responsibility for providing the base material of the disputed humidifier disinfectants to companies,\u201d said Rep. Jang in a statement. The prosecution said they would focus on finding out whether the Oxy executives had known of the toxicity of PHMG contained in their products, as well as whether they had destroyed related evidence after four disinfectant users died in 2011. It will also question if the firm fabricated the materials safety data sheet, on suspicion that Oxy bribed professors at Seoul National University and Hoseo University in exchange for overlooking toxicity test results.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","572":"The Jeju provincial government said Monday it will erect two stone statues symbolic of South Korea's resort island of Jeju this week in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion as part of its efforts to promote the island and friendly ties with the Latin American country.Delegations from the island and Paraguay are to unveil the two-- a \"dolharubang,\" a statue carved from hole-ridden basalt ubiquitous on the country's largest island, and a statue of \"haenyeo,\" or woman divers -- during a ceremony at a park in the Costanera riverside area of Asuncion on Tuesday. The two statues are both 180 centimeters tall each.Yang Ki-chul, director of the international trade bureau at the Jeju regional government, and South Korean Ambassador to Paraguay Hahn Myung-jae will represent the South Korean side at the ceremony, while the Paraguayan side will be led by Asuncion Mayor Mario Ferreiro.Dolharubang, which means \"grandfather made of stone,\" has round and bulging eyes, a firmly closed mouth, and a soldier's hat on its head, and stands in a stooped posture with its shoulders raised high and hands gathered at its stomach.\u00a0Many of these dolharubang statues are believed to have played the role of guardians in front of fortress gates on the island in the Joseon Dynasty. Scholars believe the statue originated from Mongolia, but the recent discovery of a stone statue that looks just like a dolharubang and dates back to the Liao Dynasty period at a museum in the city of Chaoyang in northeast China leads some to challenge the Mongolian origin theory.The woman diver statue representing the island's haenyeo fishing industry wears a diving suit and a pair of goggles and carries \"taewak,\" a hollowed-out gourd that serves, among many other things, as a flotation device and buoy.The delivery of the dolharubang and haenyeo statues to Paraguay comes three years after Yang Won-chan, a former leader of an association of Jeju residents living abroad, agreed with former Paraguayan President Federico Franco in August 2013 to have the statues erected in Asuncion.In January 1999, a dolharubang statue was set up in the Chinese city of Guilin as part of the city of Jeju's activities to promote friendly relations with Guilin with which it had formed a friendly relationship, the first officially known case of the statue being erected by the local government on foreign soil. Ten dolharubang statues have been erected in China.Jeju has set up 10 dolharubang statues in Japan, six in the United States and three in Germany. The installation of the statue in Paraguay brings the number of dolharubang statues in other countries to 30, all sent by the Jeju regional government. (Yonhap)","573":"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has redesignated North Korea as a \"country of particular concern\" for suppressing religious freedom, government records showed Sunday.North Korea was one of the 10 countries designated as CPCs under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. The other nine countries were Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Kerry made the designations in a government notice issued Wednesday.\"For the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the existing ongoing restrictions to which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is subject\" to trade restrictions provided in the Trade Act of 1974 with regard to its human rights violations, the notice said.The North has been on the religious freedom CPC list since 2001 and was last designated as a CPC in July last year.In an annual religious freedom report issued in October, the State Department said that the North tolerates no religious freedom and continues to deal harshly with those involved in \"almost any religious practices.\"\u00a0\"The constitution guarantees freedom of religion for its citizens and the country is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. However, religious freedom does not exist in practice,\" the 2014 International Religious Freedom Report said.The report also cited the U.N. Commission of Inquiry's report on the North's human rights situation as saying that there was an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of religion and the North's leadership should be brought to the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses.It also said that the North's policy toward religion has been to maintain \"an appearance of tolerance for international audiences, while suppressing internally all non-state-sanctioned religious activities.\" (Yonhap)","574":"Prosecutors and police announced Sunday stronger punishments for drunk driving, including confiscating the vehicles of habitual drunk drivers.The measures, to be enforced from Monday, include intensified criminal charges against passengers and applying additional punishment against drivers that have killed or seriously injured others by driving under the influence. (Yonhap)The move comes as the number of accidents involving drunk driving remains high. According to the National Police Agency, while the number of drunk drivers caught declined slightly from 269,836 in 2013 to 251,788 in 2014 and 243,100 in 2015, the number of repeat offenders increased from 39,490 in 2013 to 44,717 in 2014 and 44,986 in 2015.Last year alone, 498 of drunk drivers caused deaths, while 139 were caught driving under the influence more than five times in the last five years.Park Gyun-taek (right), head of the criminal department of the Supreme Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and Im Ho-seon, chief of the National Police Agency\u2019s traffic bureau, hold a joint press briefing on their new drunk driving measures Friday. (Yonhap)Prosecutors said they will demand the court confiscate vehicles of those that have committed drunk driving at least five times in the past five years. The vehicles will be seized during the police investigation process under criminal law. The Criminal Act\u2019s Article 48 states that an item that has been used or was sought to be used in the commission of a crime can be confiscated.The punishment against passengers will also be fortified by charging them as accessory to a crime or as joint-principal offender for encouraging the driving under the influence. Such measure would apply to cases where the passenger provided a vehicle while being aware of the driver being drunk, invited a drunk person to drive or provided alcohol to those likely to drive afterwards. Punishment of these offenses has been limited in the past. A total of 96 were indicted for neglecting drunk driving since 2002. Of them 89 were fined while five were sentenced to a prison term with probation.Drunk drivers with 0.1 percent or higher blood alcohol level will face tougher punishment of at least 1 year in prison. A drunk driver who has inflicted four weeks or more worth of treatment to victims will be sent to a formal court instead of a summary trial.Police, meanwhile, said they will fortify their crackdowns on drunk drivers by moving their surveillance locations every 20 to 30 minutes.(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","575":"Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, which has been blamed for the deaths of at least 221 humidifier disinfectant users, was found to have countered the government\u2019s health probe with their own research that suggested the deaths may have been caused by other factors, sources said Sunday.Victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectant, meanwhile, held a press conference followed by a closed-door meeting Sunday to discuss future measures and condemn the product manufacturers and distributors for their \u201cmanipulation of the media with superficial apologies.\u201dParticipants pay silent tribute to victims during a meeting of the families of the victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectant in Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)Prosecutors said that Oxy -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- submitted a 77-page report recently that sought to refute the claims, saying the deaths may have been triggered by other risk factors such as yellow dust in spring or separate germs generated from humidifiers. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed in 2011 that there was a significant association between the health impacts and the use of humidifier disinfectant Oxy Ssak Ssak.The report was submitted in January this year as the prosecution began to speed up the probe into the humidifier disinfectant tragedy. Having summoned several Oxy officials last week, the prosecution said it would also call in Oxy\u2019s former CEO Shin Hyun-woo later this week. Shin is considered the key figure for the investigation, as he worked at the company from 1991 to 2004. The product in question was sold from 2001 onward.Prosecutors will also look into whether the company attempted to distort the report to cover up the case. Speculations have grown that Oxy had allegedly distorted the report on experiments the company had requested from two institutions for toxicity tests in 2011.Right after health authorities confirmed the causal link between the products and the deaths in an August 2011 report, the British company reportedly asked for a toxicity test of the problematic ingredient, PHMG, from Seoul National University and Korea Conformity Laboratories. In Seoul National University\u2019s reproduction-toxicity test, the research team reportedly found out that 13 babies born to 15 pregnant mice died, adding credibility to the government\u2019s health probe. In a separate inhalation-toxicity test, however, the research team allegedly concluded that the causality between the disinfectant and lung diseases was not clear. Despite the two different results, the company allegedly submitted only the latter to the prosecution this year. News reports said that the company did not collect the KCL\u2019s report, which had a similar test results to the university\u2019s reproduction-toxicity test. Oxy reportedly paid over 200 million won ($174,000) to each institution for the experiments, the prosecution said. Prosecutors are probing whether the two institutions deliberately manipulated the test results or whether there was an under-the-table deal. Meanwhile, families of the humidifier disinfectant victims slammed the recent apologies offered by the disinfectant manufacturers and distributers Sunday. \u201cThe companies that had remained unperturbed for the past five years have begun to move as the prosecution\u2019s probe began to rapidly gain speed. Lotte Mart and Oxy, which had remained unmoved, started pretending to apologize in front of the press, all the while still ignoring the voices of the victims. One thing is clear in that we have heard nothing from these companies,\u201d said Kang Chan-ho, representative of the group of the families of victims.Lotte Mart made an apology to the victims on April 18, with a support fund of 10 billion won, a day before the prosecution started to summon the disinfectant company\u2019s officials. Oxy also released a letter of apology Thursday to victims of the humidifier disinfectant, saying it would offer 5 billion won in humanitarian assistance in addition to another 5 billion won in funds it had previously pledged.The families also urged the government to take stronger measures for the victims and potential victims who are waiting for their health causality test results. About 750 disinfectant users requested a health causality test last year to be recognized as official victims of the humidifier disinfectant. Only 221 so far have officially been confirmed to have been affected by the product. The full results are expected to be released late next year. They also urged the government to set up a report-receiving center for other potential victims who have not been officially recognized for the damage due to relatively mild symptoms. To the new National Assembly elected earlier this month, the victims and their families asked for a parliamentary hearing over the disinfectant tragedy. They also demanded that it pass a pending law that would allow the victims to receive financial support.

Our navy\u2019s operational capacities have been extremely enhanced,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying.South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the North is hastening the development of the SLBM, which has the distinct advantage of being stealthier when fired from a submarine.\u201dCompared to other countries with SLBMs, the actual deployment of the SLBM is expected to be 3-4 years. But there is also a possibility that it may take less time if they (Pyongyang) concentrate efforts on this issue,\u201c said ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun.Saturday\u2018s launch was assessed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to have flown 30 kilometers, far less than the known minimum range for the KN-11 SLBM at 300 kilometers.While experts doubt Pyongyang\u2019s claim of a successful flight and detonation, it is presumed to have at least successfully conducted a \u201ccold launch,\u201d which refers a missile being expelled first from a platform and then igniting in midair. This is crucial in submarine launches to prevent damage to the vessel. Pyongyang conducted an unsuccessful underwater SLBM launch in November, with its subsequent launch in the following month was presumed to have been from a barge, not a submarine.The KCNA claimed the latest test verified the stability of the cold launch system at maximum depth. Military experts view a depth of at least 20 to 30 meters to be significant in deeming the test launch\u2019s success.The depth of Saturday\u2018s launch is presumed to be far less, at 10-15 meters. North Korea has been stepping up claims about its nuclear and missile capacities, even firing its intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile earlier in the month for the first time. That launch was assessed to have been a failure.The U.N. last month imposed what officials have called \u201cthe strongest sanctions ever\u201d against the hermit kingdom as punitive action for its Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch.Also on Saturday, North Korea\u2019s foreign minister Ri Su-yong in New York said his country is ready to halt its nuclear tests on the condition that South Korea and the U.S. discontinue their annual joint military drills. In an interview with the Associated Press, Ri said the recent escalation had been prompted by the Seoul-Washington military exercise. South Korean military officials had said that this year\u2019s Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercise would be \u201cthe largest ever\u201d in terms of size and military assets deployed.There had been widespread speculation in South Korea that the North is likely to conduct a fifth nuclear test before its ruling party\u2019s convention in early May to rally the support of citizens behind the Kim regime, while simultaneously pressuring the international community. The South Korean military has been on alert based on the government\u2019s prediction the test may take place around Monday, which marks the anniversary for the creation of the North\u2019s state army.North Korea, which has stepped up demonstrations of its arsenal recently, reportedly deployed 300 multiple-rocket launchers near the inter-Korea borders.

According to police, 498 drunk drivers caused fatal accidents last year. The number of people who broke the law by driving while intoxicated five times within the last five years stood at 139.Still, cautious implementation is needed as the seizure could lead to an infringement on private property.

From 2010 to 2014 alone, the number of double-income households increased from 27.9 percent to 31.2 percent. More women in Korea are being educated, participating in the labor force and putting off marriage.\u00a0\u00a0Turbulent relationships between mothers-in-law and their daughters-in-law have been featured countless times in South Korea\u2018s TV series, films and plays. A scene from MBC\u2018s drama series \"Iron Lady Cha.\" (MBC)In the 1980s, only about 30 percent of Korean girls enrolled in post-secondary education, whereas 74.6 percent of school girls did so last year. Women\u2019s employment rate also rose from 42.8 percent to 49.5 in the same time period. The average age at first marriage among Korean women increased significantly from 23 in 1981 to 30 this year. The generational dissonance between Korean mothers-in-law \u2013 who expects their daughters-in-law to take care of domestic chores and husbands even if they have their own careers \u2013 and their \u201cworn-out\u201d daughters-in-law have been prevalently discussed on Korea\u2019s social media. Earlier this month, a citizen journalist\u2019s column on her wish to be treated to a home-cooked dinner by her pregnant daughter-in-law triggered outrage among some netizens on SNS, some even calling it a \u201cpiece that belongs to the horror genre.\u201d The netizens asked why the author expects a home-cooked meal -- which requires time and service on top of money \u2013 only from her daughter-in-law, not from her own son. \u201cThere is a severe generational gap between women born in the 1950s and 60s, and those who were born in the 70s and 80s,\u201d said Hong Seung-ah, a researcher who specializes in women\u2019s work and life balance at the Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute. \u201cWhile many of the older women spent their lives as housewives, thinking domestic chores and child care are women\u2019s responsibilities, the younger generation value individual happiness and professional ambitions, as well as sharing domestic work with their (male) spouses.\u201dHong pointed out that for women in their 50s and older, the idea of sharing domestic responsibilities with their husbands was practically unthinkable, even if they had their own jobs while raising their young children. \u201cThey are not really used to the idea of equality at home. Regardless of their employment status, they considered domestic chores as their basic duty (as a wife and a mother). And some of them have trouble coping with the changing gender roles as they are expecting their daughters-in-law to do the same.\u201dStatistics show that Korean men still spend the least hours on domestic chores in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. As of 2014, Korean women on average spent 3 hours and 25 minutes daily on household chores on weekdays, whereas men only spent 39 minutes. Jeong Eun-ji, a 34-year-old working wife, said Korean mothers in their 50s and older contributed to the gender disparity experienced by young married Korean women at home, by not teaching their sons how to perform household activities while raising them. Her husband, for example, lived with his parents for 34 years until he married Jeong two years ago. Throughout his entire life prior to the marriage, his mother did all household chores for him \u2013 preparing his meals, cleaning his room and doing his laundry. She said her younger brother was raised in a similar way \u2013 her mother would only make Jeong help her with cooking and other household chores. \u201cIt seems like my mother-in-law still wants me to replace her as his caregiver slash his personal chef, instead of treating him like an adult. She once told me, \u2018your husband needs somebody to look after him. Otherwise he\u2019s going to skip meals.\u2019 But he\u2019s 36 years old. If he skips meals, let him deal with it. It shouldn\u2019t be his mother\u2019s problem anymore.\u201dA scene from jTBC\u2018s drama series \u201cChildless Comfort,\u201d which deals with a\u00a0full-time pharmacist\u00a0(right) and her difficult relationship with her mohter-in-law.\u00a0(jTBC)Between \u2018Please rest\u2019 and \u2018I appreciate your work\u2019 Lee Mi-yeon, a 38-year-old public servant, thinks of her mother-in-law as a sweet, kind-hearted person. Born in 1948 to farmers in a small rural town, she couldn\u2019t continue her studies after finishing elementary school as she had to care for her eight younger siblings while working in her family farm. After marrying Lee\u2019s father-in-law, a railway worker from a not-so-affluent family, she became a full-time housewife and mother. \u201cShe just belongs to a different generation,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat does not make her a bad person.\u201dFor Lee\u2019s mother-in-law, making food on national holidays for her grown children is one of her biggest joys. She also takes pride in being respected by her daughters-in-law, usually in the form of being treated to a home-cooked meal. But Lee said it was not always easy getting along with her mother-in-law, who firmly believed that domestic chores should be done by women. Whenever she and her husband visited the parents\u2019 house, only Lee would have to help her make food, while her husband was told to rest. \u201cShe would always tell me, \u2018I appreciate your hard work,\u2019 while making sure my husband does not set foot in the kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019d tell him: \u2018Please rest, you have to rest. It\u2019s your rare chance to relax away from work.\u2019 But, you know, I\u2019m also employed full-time.\u201dOnce, Lee was almost late for work because her mother-in-law, who was briefly staying at Lee\u2019s house, insisted Lee must use newly cooked rice for her husband\u2019s breakfast, instead of the left-over made the night before. \u201cShe said her son needs to have a proper breakfast with freshly cooked rice,\u201d Lee said. Another time, when Lee\u2019s family went on a camping, her husband ended up grilling the meat at an outdoor barbecue \u2013 as he was more experienced with the fire. Her mother-in-law became extremely upset. \u201cShe kept saying, \u2018He should be eating! He should be eating (not grilling)!\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt was as if she was witnessing his son being severely mistreated by others in public.\u201d\u201cMy husband repeatedly explained that it\u2019s more common for men to grill meat at a barbecue these days, but it just made her even more upset,\u201d Lee said. Park Soo-ha, a 28-year-old working professional in Seoul, said she had to lie many times to her mother-in-law, especially when she and her husband ate out. Like Kim, Park also received regular phone calls from her mother-in-law, who would always ask her what she made for her husband for dinner each day. \u201cI would just say whatever menu that popped up in my head,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day I\u2019d say we ate kimchi stew, the other day I\u2019d say I cooked the meat you sent us a few days back. Should I repeat the same menu from the day before, she would say \u2018You ate that again today?\u2019\u201d Once, when Park lied she made galchijjim, braised hairtail, for dinner, Park\u2019s mother-in-law became suspicious. \u201cShe asked me to make the same dish and bring it to her house the next time I visit her,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bought the dish at a market and put it in a Tupperware container, to make it look like it\u2019s homemade.\u201dFeeling conflictedDuring her first year as a married woman, Lee Su-bin received an unexpected phone call from her sister-in-law. Lee had just made a reservation at a restaurant for her mother-in-law\u2019s upcoming birthday. \u201cMy sister-in-law said, \u2018Daughters-in-law are supposed to provide a home-cooked meal for their mothers-in-law\u2019s first birthday that they celebrate as a family. You know that, right?\u2019\u201d Despite the pressure, Lee went ahead with the restaurant plan, as her husband defended Lee on her behalf.But Lee said she felt guilty when her mother-in-law\u2019s birthday returned a year later.\u201cSo I just decided to make her a home-cooked birthday dinner just to get it off my chest,\u201d she said.Lee said as a woman who grew up in a gender-specific culture, she finds herself feeling conflicted about such traditional yet sexist expectations on daughters-in-laws.\u201cTo be honest, I know that if I had a younger brother and his wife didn\u2019t provide a home-cooked dinner for my mother\u2019s birthday, I would also question her fitness to become the member of our family,\u201d she said. Park, meanwhile, said even her own mother tells her to make sure her husband eats properly. \u201cI make more money than my husband, and I work longer hours than him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd still, cooking is considered my responsibility (by both my own mother and my mother-in-law.)\u201dColliding different dreamsIt took some time for Kim\u2019s mother-in-law to understand why Kim needs to catch up on her sleep during the day. She\u2019s never been treated as an inpatient at a general hospital, and has only encountered nurses at small clinics. She simply thought being a nurse at night can\u2019t be \u201cthat hard.\u201d\u201cIn my mother-in-law\u2019s time, most married women who had a job worked as bookkeepers, domestic workers or teachers,\u201d Kim said. \u201cShe said all the nurses she\u2019d encountered are \u2018just sitting down\u2019 a lot of the time.\u201dThree years ago, her mother-in-law temporarily moved in to Kim\u2019s house to care for her grandchildren. Her mother-in-law did not understand why Kim was always asleep during the day, and why her son was doing domestic chores.Once, before going to work, Kim was about to have her lunch at home after waking up during the day. But all of a sudden, her mother-in-law started cleaning the fridge and took every item out of it, making the kitchen too cluttered to prepare anything. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why she did that,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI just grabbed a piece of bread on my way to work and cried until I arrived in the hospital. It just felt so unfair.\u201dTo tackle the situation, Kim\u2019s husband had to repeatedly explain to his mother, in detail, what Kim has to do at work -- including maintaining reports of patient\u2019s medical histories and providing instant care during medical emergencies.With Kim\u2019s husband\u2019s help, her mother-in-law has changed over the years, albeit reluctantly, she said. She no longer calls Kim during the day. She now asks her own sons for help when preparing for food on holidays. \u201cMy mother-in-law said although my husband is her own son, he is still a grown man, and she\u2019s just not comfortable nor used to asking adult male for favors,\u201d Kim said.One of Kim\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s biggest joys has been ironing her son\u2019s suits. Kim never really understood why, until about four years ago. Having been married to a blue-collar worker, her mother-in-law said she at least hoped her son to be respected by others. To her, a respected man was someone who is highly educated, successful, does not have worry about domestic chores and treated well by his wife and his children. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired women who get to iron suits for her husbands,\u201d Kim\u2019s mother-in-law told her four years ago, while ironing her son\u2019s shirt. \u201cBut ironing suits for my spouse has never been one of my lifelong wishes,\u201d Kim said.

Officials of state-run railway operator KORAIL perform rescues and restorations Friday at the scene of a passenger train derailment around Yulchon Station in Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. The accident left one dead and eight injured. (Yonhap)Of 27 passengers and crew members, a 53-year-old engineer surnamed Yang was killed in the crash. The other engineer and seven passengers sustained minor injuries. According to the regional railroad police, the Mugunghwa train was excessively speeding when it switched tracks and entered a curved section, allegedly traveling at 127 kilometers per hour when asked to operate at below 50 kilometers per hour.The train, which had departed Seoul at 10:45 p.m. on the previous day, is suspected of speeding under pressure to arrive in time at Yeosu Station.Police are looking into the train\u2019s black box and two-way radio communications for any possible misconduct or violation of safety rules. During questioning, an official at the controller and the train\u2018s second engineer gave conflicting statements, authorities said. While the official claimed to have ordered the engineer to slow down before reaching Yulchon station, the latter rebutted that he was told to lower the speed at the next stop. The train operations, which were suspended in Yeosu and nearby Suncheon areas, will resume early Saturday morning.KORAIL dispatched some 200 staff members to restore the rails and hired charter buses to transport passengers during the recovery work, which could take up to 20 hours.The day\u2018s accident was the latest in a series of train derailments this year. A freight train went off the tracks near Sintanjin Station in Daejeon last month, triggering worries over the state-run rail agency\u2019s lack of safety measures.According to statistics by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority, South Korea has seen an average of 3.5 trail derailment cases annually since 2001.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","580":"President Park Geun-hye warned against the dangers of populist campaign pledges Friday, stressing that maintaining fiscal soundness is a key factor that the government should take into account in setting its 2017 budget proposal.\"Laws containing populist ideas will burden not only the current generation but the next,\" Park said chairing the national fiscal strategy meeting at the presidential office. She added excessive spending on welfare could have an impact on the country's long-term fiscal health.The chief executive also advocated special administrative rules like the \"pay-go\" system. The system makes clear that any additional outlays must be offset by spending cuts or revenue increases. \"The problem of maintaining long-term fiscal soundness is something that is agreed upon by the people,\" the president pointed out.`At the meeting that sets government guidelines on spending, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said it will maintain its expansionary fiscal policy mode for the next five years to prop up the economy. It, however, said every effort is going to be made to cut unnecessary outlays.The ministry moreover has been moving to streamline the public sector to get rid of overlapping institutions. This can save money and lead to a more efficient fiscal spending structure.The chief executive's latest remarks apparently came after the political parties spearheaded different welfare pledges in the lead-up to the April 13 parliamentary elections.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, stressed the importance of \"productive welfare,\" saying that the expanded welfare policy will eventually induce growth in related industries, such as health and medical services.Kang Bong-kyun, a campaign chief of the ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, agreed with Kim on the need for the expansion of social welfare but warned against irresponsible policies that leaned toward populism. He argued such actions will not solve the country's problems of slow growth or improve the country's employment market. (Yonhap)","581":"U.N.

Food and Agriculture Organization and carried by U.S.-based media Voice of America, North Korea's grain production, which is mostly rice, stood at 5.06 million tons last year. This is down 11 percent from 2014.The VOA said that in some areas of the communist country, the grain production decreased by half due to a drought that has been ongoing for two years in a row.The grain production decrease also affected the regime's food rationing system. For the first three months of this year, the state-sanctioned food supply was significantly reduced to 370 grams daily per person, the media outlet quoting a FAO spokesperson said. This is far less than the U.N.'s recommendation of 600 grams as well as the North Korean government's target of 573 grams.Accordingly, the reduced rationing affected many residents suffering from malnutrition. The rate of North Koreans' malnutrition for 2014 to 2016 period soared to 41.6 percent, which is 6.1 percentage points up from 35.5 percent tallied for the 2005 to 2007 period.The United Nations has allocated approximately $121 million for various projects to help the impoverished country this year. The total amount breaks down to $54.7 million for nutritional projects, $29.8 million for health and sanitation, $23.2 million for food aid including fertilizer and farming equipment and $13.90 million to improve the country's tap water sanitary infrastructure.VOA said the United Nations has experienced a lot of difficulties in assisting North Korea following the international community's tough sanctions on the reclusive country for its nuclear and missile provocations. Under the circumstances, the number of donators and the amount of donations for helping North Korea have been falling for the past several years.The international community provided some $300 million in various assistance projects for North Korea in 2003, but this plummeted to $40 million last year.The FAO spokesperson told VOA that humanitarian assistance should be unrelated to political affairs, asking for more aid for women, children and senior citizens in North Korea so that the vulnerable social group will be able to have their basic needs met.

Designating April 20-26 as Climate Change Week, the Environment Ministry has annually promoted environment-related events ranging from campaigns for using public transportation to photo exhibitions, awareness classes and experts\u2019 forums. These are held in several cities, including Busan, Daegu and Ulsan.\u00a0 Activists dressed as traffic police and street cleaners with high occupational exposure to fine dust call for safer environment in an event held in Seoul to mark the Earth Day on April 22, 2015. YonhapThe largest event is Earth Hour, which will be held Friday to remind people of the importance of cutting carbon emissions. Citizens will be recommended to turn off all electric lights from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. when electricity consumption is at its highest. The Earth Hour event is the annual signature event of global conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature. Earth Hour was also held nationwide ahead of Earth Day on March 19, drawing massive participation from the public and private sector. This Friday\u2019s Earth Hour will be independently promoted by municipalities. Earth Day was started in 1970 by 20 million Americans, who took to the streets to protest against the uncontrolled impact of fossil-fuel-driven industrial development. The one-day demonstration soon spread to other communities across the U.S., leading the U.S. Congress to pass landmark environmental laws that ensured the community\u2019s right-to-know provisions. They also allowed Americans to sue the government if it fails to carry out the law.\u00a0About 50 years later, Earth Day has become an international day for countries to remind people of the value of the Earth and encourage communities to take action to save the planet.\u00a0 (123rf)This year\u2019s Earth Day is historic, as the world leaders from at least 150 countries will gather at the United Nations headquarters in New York to officially sign the Paris Agreement -- a deal reached at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in December to limit global warming. More than 190 countries agreed to limit planetary temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists consider to be the threshold for catastrophic climate change. The new deal will replace the Kyoto Protocol, which only required developed states to curb emissions. International calls have grown that developing countries should also take part in the carbon cut move in order to practically limit the temperature rise. Korea pledged last year to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 37 percent from the expected business-as-usual level by 2030. The plan comprises actual mitigations of 25.7 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and the purchase of global carbon credits equivalent to 11.3 percent.The Paris Agreement be will opened for a year for signing. It will take effect once at least 55 countries sign the accord. The emissions of those countries, however, must exceed 55 percent of the world\u2019s total emissions.

Such a concurrent activity could be part of the North's camouflage, concealment and deception procedures for the facility,\" it said.38 North also said that the imagery shows limited vehicle and equipment activity at the North Portal, where the North's three recent nuclear tests took place, as well as at the Main Support Area.\"These activities by themselves do not establish that test preparations are imminent.

(Yonhap)","591":"North Korea's failed launch of its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile last week sparked a huge fireball that damaged the launcher and could have also injured or killed missile technicians on the ground, a news report said Wednesday.The missile blew up about 300 feet above the ground, shortly after Friday's launch, and U.S. strategic defense surveillance systems, both airborne and space-based, videotaped the explosion, the Washington Free Beacon reported, citing U.S. defense officials.Two road-mobile Musudan launchers were set up for the test, but the second was not fired after the explosion, the report said. It also cited a diplomatic source as saying that the likely cause of the explosion was a faulty fuel system or turbo pump failure.The Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile is an indigenous variant of the Russian SS-N-6 submarine-launched ballistic missile, known by Moscow as the R-27, which the North obtained covertly from Russia sometime in the 1990s, the report said.\"The North Koreans seemed to just believe it would succeed because the R-27 SLBM of former Soviet Union was one of the most tested nuclear warhead delivery systems ever produced, and North Korea had already done a lot of ground tests,\" the source was quoted as saying. \"However, a real launching test is totally different from the ground test.\"Western intelligence agencies do not know the ultimate cause of the launch failure. \"And the North Koreans probably don't either,\" the source said, according to the report.Comment from the U.S. Defense Department was not immediately available.The launch was the latest in a series of provocative acts the North has undertaken in defiance of international pressure increased in the wake of its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month.Concerns also persist that Pyongyang could carry out yet another nuclear test in an effort to project an image of Kim Jong-un as a strong leader in the lead-up to the Workers' Party Congress next month.

That day, the Rhee government proclaimed martial law in order to suppress demonstrations. The movement led to the resignation of Rhee and the transition to the Second Republic of Korea.On Monday, a day prior to the anniversary of the April Movement, a group of foreign students visited the April 19 National Cemetery to learn about Korea\u2019s past with the help of the Gangbuk-gu District Office in northwestern Seoul.A group of foreign students pay tribute Monday in front of the tombstone of patriot Yi Jun at the April 19 National Cemetery.

Upon hearing the interpreter\u2019s explanation of one of Korea\u2019s fiercest moments yearning for democracy, Hoyle said she was reminded of a political figure in her own country.\u201cPhilippines also had a similar time when the country was ruled by one ruler for 21 years,\u201d said Hoyle.\u201cFerdinand Marcos placed the country under martial law, revamped the constitution, silenced the media and many were killed during his reign,\u201d she added. But in 1986, public outrage led to the Philippines\u2019 People Power Revolution, which removed him from power.Victor Saidi Phiri, a student from Malawi, said protest for democracy has different definitions by time and country. \u201cThere are some countries undergoing war in the African continent, whether it is physical or not,\u201d said him.\u201cSince I am in Korea, I think it is integral to join the opportunity to know about the history (where) you\u2019re staying. Before coming here, I thought South Korea was just as dangerous as in North Korea,\u201d said Phiri.A cultural tourism interpreter who volunteered to work with Gangbuk-gu Office said that she was glad to see foreign visitors learning to understand Korea\u2019s spirit and historical moments.\u201cI tried to give them an easy and short explanation, to help them learn about the background in Korean history,\u201d said Choi Gwang-young.There are a total of 17 cultural tourism interpreters who voluntarily joined to be part of Gangbuk-gu Office\u2019s regional cultural tourism program.

South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system can intercept North Korea's SLBMs if they are fired at South Korea. His remarks were made a day after the North test-fired an SLBM from waters southeast of the coastal port city of Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province. The test-fire, however, ended in failure, according to the South Korean military. \"If the North fires an SLBM at South Korea from the east coast, it can be intercepted by THAAD just like Musudan missiles since the North Korea will have to adjust the range of the missiles, which can fly 2,000 kilometers,\" Han said on a KBS TV show. \"The North's SLBM is a missile launched from a submarine, so based on our Navy's antisubmarine operations, we will detect and incapacitate the missile before it is fired.\"On Friday, South Korea and the United States announced that the countries have agreed to deploy the THAAD missile interception system in the Northeast Asian country in order to upgrade the military allies' defense against North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities. The South Korean defense ministry said the allies will seek to deploy and start operations of one THAAD battery in South Korea at least by the end of 2017.\"THAAD is a missile interception system for short-range and intermediate-range missiles whose range is under 3,000 km, and it can intercept any of the North's scud, Rodong and Musudan missiles,\" he said. \"Musudan are missiles that are in the3,000-3,500 km range, and their operation depth for the Korean Peninsula is shorter, but if North Korea decides to use them (on the Korean Peninsula) by adjusting the amount of fuel or firing them at a high angle with such purpose, THAAD will show its capability.\" Han said South Korea already has Patriot missiles that can intercept short-range missiles, but since their covering range is small, the addition of THAAD will be a big help.\"One THAAD unit can cover half or two-thirds of South Korea,\"he said. \"This is a 'big umbrella' that can cover 10 times the area that a 'small umbrella' like Patriot missiles can.\"The defense minister said THAAD won't be able to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles heading toward the United States, and will only be used to defend the South.Han said THAAD will be controlled by the U.S. Forces Korea's Seventh Air Force Commander in wartime, but South Korean Air Force Operations Command chief will command the system in peacetime. \"If there is a situation to intercept a North Korean missile in peacetime, we will counteract by combining all assets of both the U.S. and South Korea under the command of the Air Force Operations chief,\" he said. \"Although it is likely that the North will only launch missiles at South Korea in wartime, since there is a possibility that North Korea will provoke us in ordinary times, we will constantly be ready to carry out countermeasures.\" Han responded to China's discontent over THAAD being placed on South Korean soil and concerns that it could worsen the relationship between South Korea and China, saying the two countries should strengthen their talks. Han said that the site for the THAAD deployment will be announced soon, but the specific location will not be made public due to military secrecy.

The intermediate range missile is estimated to have a range of 3,000-4,000 kilometers.There is high speculation that North Korea may carry out its fifth nuclear test or fire off a long-range missile ahead of the upcoming party congress slated for early May.North Korea has ratcheted up its bellicose rhetoric since early March by claiming that it has succeeded in miniaturizing nuclear bombs and acquiring the technology that allows a ballistic missile to re-enter the atmosphere.Early last month, the U.N. Security Council slapped tougher sanctions on Pyongyang for its nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February.He said that recent mass defections by North Koreans reflect that the sanctions are having an impact on curbing the North's behavior.A group of 13 North Koreans who worked at a North Korea-run restaurant in China defected to South Korea earlier in the month amid the toughened international sanctions.Restaurants in foreign nations serve as one of the main sources of hard currency for North Korea as dollar earnings are suspected of bankrolling the North's nuke and missile programs.\"More cases of such defections are likely to continue.

Last week, 38 North reported spotting \"exhaust plumes\" from a building used to heat the reprocessing plant.\"The presence of a loaded flatcar, together with the earlier presence of exhaust plumes, suggests that North Korea is preparing or conducting a reprocessing campaign to separate more plutonium for weapons,\" 38 North said.In addition, the North also built a new dirt access road and began excavating parallel to a building, known as Building 500, which was used to store waste from earlier reprocessing campaigns.\u00a0 The excavation could be aimed at expanding the building's storage capabilities or improving its design features in order to reactivate the facility for a new reprocessing campaign, 38 North said. It could also mean that a reprocessing campaign is already underway and the building has been reactivated for waste storage, it said.The 5-megawatt nuclear reactor, which produces spent fuel, shows no indications of steam generation or cooling water exhaust, suggesting that the reactor is not operating or is running at an extremely low level, 38 North said.\"Should this be the case, it would support the above indications of a reprocessing campaign as the 5-megawatt reactor would typically have to suspend operations to unload the spent fuel rods to be sent to the Radiochemical Laboratory,\" it said.The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods that, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make one bomb a year.The reactor has provided Pyongyang with weapons-grade plutonium that the regime used in its first three nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The North conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan.6, claiming it successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.Last month, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a worldwide threat assessment that the North had restarted its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and has since run it long enough to harvest plutonium \"within a matter of weeks to months.\" (Yonhap)","606":"The National Police Agency said Friday it is currently investigating 1,267 people suspected of violating the elections law, including 43 lawmakers-elect.Police said it has conducted a crackdown on 1,606 people suspected of illegally campaigning for the April 13 general election.

The authorization represented a bolstering of the claims because 27 of the newly approved 35 social studies textbooks -- or nearly 80 percent -- accused South Korea of \"illegally occupying\" the islets.South Korea rejects the claims as nonsense because the country regained independence from Japan's 35-year colonial rule in 1945 and reclaimed sovereignty over its territory, including Dokdo and many other islands around the Korean Peninsula.The ministry is expected to lodge a protest with the Tokyo government by calling in a Japanese Embassy official later in the day.Dokdo, a pair of outcroppings lying in the East Sea, has long been a thorn in bilateral relations. Seoul effectively controls the islets with a police detachment stationed there since 1954.The report still referred to South Korea as Japan's \"most important neighbor that shares strategic interests,\" saying Tokyo will improve bilateral relations following last year's agreement to resolve the issue of Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.The accord will be the key to opening a \"new era\" in the two countries' ties, it added.Last year's report referred to the South simply as the \"most important neighbor,\" which marked a toning down from the 2014 report that said the two countries share basic values and interests, such as free democracy and basic human rights.

The North may have deployed some 50 Musudan missiles.The South Korean military had previously detected North Korea deploying one or two Musudan missiles near the east coastal city of Wonsan in the previous weeks for a potential launch. With a range of 3,000-4,000 kilometers, the missile can fly over South Korea and Japan to reach as far as Guam, where the United States military forces are stationed. North Korea is prohibited by a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions from launching ballistic missiles.The latest launch is apparently part of North Korea's celebration of the 104th birthday of the country's founding father Kim Il-sung. The country has marked the national holiday in the past with elaborate military events.South Korea's military said it is bracing for further military provocations by North Korea as Pyongyang is moving toward more large-scale events down the road, including its ruling party's 7th congress set for early May.\"We are preparing against the possibility that the North could carry out heavyweight provocations at any time, including the fifth nuclear test,\" a military official said. The latest defiant military action followed the UNSC's adoption of a biting resolution on North Korea in early March in response to the communist country's fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February.Since the new resolution, North Korea protested with a test-firing of a series of short and mid-range missile and multiple rocket launchers, heightening military tension on the Korean Peninsula.

The seven defectors include former floor leader Yoo Seung-min who scored a landslide victory in Daegu. If they return, the party would recover its status as the largest group in the National Assembly.\u201cI hereby take all responsibility for the election defeat and resign from party chairmanship as of today,\u201d Kim said at the disbanding ceremony of the party\u2019s election strategy team.\u201cThe party humbly accepts the people\u2019s strict judgment over our infighting and division,\u201d he added.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung leaves the National Assembly building after announcing his resignation on Thursday. (Yonhap)The general election opened a three-party political framework by downsizing the ruling party and expanding\u00a0two\u00a0opposition parties in the parliament.The Saenuri was not only booted from majority status but also tumbled down to second-rank party, giving way to The Minjoo Party of Korea.The 20th parliamentary race ended with the Minjoo Party taking 123 seats, followed by the Saenuri with 122, the People\u2019s Party\u2019s with 38, and the Justice Party with six, in addition to 11 independents.By constituencies, the Minjoo party acquired 110 out of 253 seats nationwide, followed by the Saenuri with 105 and the new opposition People\u2019s Party with 25. The far-left minority Justice Party claimed two.The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in speaks at a press conference at the National Assembly on Thursday. (Yonhap)The opposition camp claimed a parliamentary majority for the first time in 16 years, posing tricky challenges to the Park Geun-hye administration and the ruling party in the remaining 22 months until the next presidential election.Kim, who scored an easy victory in his Busan constituency, was seen to lose ground in the party and his potential presidential bid, following the election debacle.Supreme Council member Kim Tae-ho also announced his resignation and he is expected to be followed by his colleagues, many of whom have lost in their current constituencies against opposition rivals.Another Supreme Council member Rep. Suh Chung-won, a close confidante to President Park, won his eighth term and became the top senior in the upcoming parliament. He did not show up at the party meeting.The party immediately summoned a top officials\u2019 meeting in the afternoon to discuss the establishment of an emergency committee to take over the missing leadership. The interim leadership will face multiple whammies, including an extensive reshuffle, power struggles and blame games among factions.Cheong Wa Dae, having failed to create political synergy through Saenuri\u2019s victory, is highly likely to carry out a large-scale reshuffle of its own so as to gain momentum during the last two years of the current Park Geun-hye administration.\u201cWe hope that the 20th National Assembly will care about people\u2019s livelihood and work for the sake of the people,\u201d said presidential spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk, without commenting further on the election resultsThe main opposition party may seem to be better off but is now officially challenged by the third-largest People\u2019s Party, which took away most of their longtime stronghold in the Gwangju-Jeolla area.Minjoo\u2019s chief Kim Chong-in celebrated the party\u2019s achievement, even paying tribute to former chief Moon Jae-in for rallying supporters in the metropolitan region.It was in the Seoul-Gyeonggi belt, which comprises almost half of the nation\u2019s constituencies and the largest number of swing voters, that the opposition swept a majority, even in districts considered to be unwavering strongholds of the conservative.\u201cThe greatest significance of this election is the breakdown of the Saenuri\u2019s parliamentary majority,\u201d Kim said in a press conference Thursday.\u201cThe people have made their stern judgment on the economic errors of the Park Geun-hye government and of the ruling party.\u201dBut he did acknowledge the party\u2019s obvious defeat in the Gwangju-Jeolla area, called the Honam region.\u201cIt would be shameless of us to ask for support after disappointing (Honam voters),\u201d Kim said.\u201cWe fully embrace Honam\u2019s public sentiment which scolded us for our faults.\u201dThe rising star People\u2019s Party, meanwhile, rejoiced in their newfound status as the third-largest parliamentary bloc with strong casting vote power.People\u2019s Party cochairman Rep.

(Yonhap)Despite the skepticism that had prevailed over its identity, the party managed to secure 38 seats, over the 20-seat minimum required to constitute a parliamentary bargaining body and even exceeding its hopeful target of 35.Having successfully come between the two leading parties, neither of which grasps a decision-making majority, the People\u2019s Party will hold the tie-breaking vote in the upcoming legislature.Key decisions including the passage of pending economic and labor reform bills as well as the selection of the next Assembly speaker through votes will also depend on the decision of the No. 3 party.The challenge for this novice party, however, is its relatively weak positioning in terms of policies.Despite its slogan to act conservatively on national security issues and progressively on economic issues, the party has so far failed to mark its presence, other than in its regional Honam identity.Observers, nevertheless, point out that it is this dovish centrist stance that attracted a large number of undecided voters who shunned the increasing bipolarization between the leading parties.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","612":"The 2016 parliamentary elections results highlighted the dynamic nature of South Korean politics as some candidates solidified their images as competent presidential candidates while several veteran politicians find themselves sidestepped from contention.In Seoul's Nowon district, Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chairman of the splinter People's Party and a potential presidential hopeful, defeated rival Lee Jun-seok of the ruling Saenuri Party with 52 percent of the vote against his rivals 31 percent, according to the National Election Commission (NEC) that overseas ballots.Wednesday's polls carried an extra burden for the software mogul and his newly launched party as the polls were a crucial test for his political ambitions down the line, in next December's presidential election.\u00a0 South Koreans will go to the polls in December 2017 to elect a new leader to succeed President Park Geun-hye whose single five-year term ends in early 2018. By law, she cannot seek re-election. \"I once again want to thank the people of Nowon,\" Ahn said, saying that he will pay back by improving livelihoods and seeing better politics.The party also grabbed a total of 38 seats, far more than 20 which allows the party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Meanwhile, it was a total defeat for Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, although he managed to obtain his sixth parliamentary seat by beating Kim Bi-oh of the Minjoo Party in the southern port city of Busan.The Saenuri Party vowed to win a parliamentary majority, but it has to settle for just 122 seats, after it has suffered a blow due to an internal feud over the candidate nomination process.The party's victory would have been a boon for Kim's presidential chances, but its defeat has raised doubts about his leadership and appeal as a presidential contender. The lawmaker, who had been at the center of controversy offered to step down as chairman on Thursday following the polls.Moreover, the latest poll showed that 12.9 percent of people supported Kim in a potential presidential race, even behind former Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon of the Saenuri Party, according to the NEC.The poll also showed 20.7 percent of people supported Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the Minjoo Party, in a potential presidential. Ahn is trailing behind with only 10 percent of support in the poll, although this may change with the election results.In Jongno district in central Seoul, Oh lost to Chung Sye-kyun of the Minjoo Party, who garnered more than 50 percent of the vote, said the NEC.\"I will take the time of self-reflection and deeply examine myself,\" said Oh, noting that the voters are still angry at him for giving up his mayorship years ago.Meanwhile, Chung, who will take his sixth parliamentary seat, newly emerged as a new potential presidential hopeful from the liberal bloc by defeating Oh in Jongno, which is considered one of the most crucial electorates in Seoul.As for Moon, it is neither a victory nor a failure.The party successfully grabbed 123 seats, much higher than its initial goal and even managed to take three districts of wealthy Gangnam in southern Seoul, a traditional stronghold for the ruling party.However, the party was able to take victory in only three out of 28 electorates in Honam, referring to the southwestern region that has traditionally been a bastion of support for liberal parties like Minjoo.The People's Party, on the other hand, took a sweeping victory in the region by taking 23 Honam seats.Moreover, Moon earlier promised that he will retire from politics and not participate in the presidential elections if the party losses support from its home turf of the Honam.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of Minjoo, secured his fifth parliamentary term by taking the second spot in the liberal party's 47-member proportional representative seat lineup.Of 300 lawmakers, with 253 of them to be selected through direct elections and the remaining 47 proportional representation seats to be allocated to parties according to the numbers of votes that they receive overall.Kim is the first lawmaker to be elected five times on a proportional ticket.Among the distinguishable winners is Suh Chung-won, who managed to obtain his eighth parliamentary seat after taking the victory in an electorate in Hwaseong, just south of Seoul.Suh is most likely to be elected a new parliamentary speaker, succeeding National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa.Meanwhile, a number of political heavyweights from both the ruling and opposition parties failed to enter the 20th National Assembly.Rep. Rhee In-je, a senior member of the Saenuri party and a six-term lawmaker, lost to Kim Jong-min of the Minjoo Party in a closely contested race in the Nonsan electorate in the central region of South Chungcheong Province. Veteran lawmaker Rep. Lee Jae-oh also failed in his sixth bid as an independent in Eunpyong district in Seoul.Lee, a five-term lawmaker and considered one of the non-mainstream members of the Saenuri Party, quit the party after failing to win a nomination,Hwang Woo-yea, a five-term lawmaker and former education minister, also failed to grab his seat in Incheon, west of Seoul, against Shin Dong-keun of the Minjoo Party. (Yonhap)","613":"Just less than 60 percent of South Korean voters cast their ballots to elect new lawmakers, the national election watchdog said Thursday.More than 24.4 million out of over 42.1 million, or 58. percent, went to 13,837 polling stations across the country to elect a new 300-member National Assembly on Wednesday, said the National Election Commission (NEC).The official voter turnout is higher than the previous general elections in 2012 when 54.2 percent was recorded, the NEC said. It also marks the highest turnout in 12 years since 63.9 percent was recorded in the parliamentary elections in 1996.Election officials attributed the higher-than-expected voter turnout to the highest voter turnout of an early voting that took place last week.During the two-day early voting period from Friday to Saturday, 5.13 million voters, or 12.2 percent, cast their ballots at more than 3,000 polling stations.\"People's attention to politics was very high during the 19th general elections four years ago as it took place just before the presidential election,\" said an NEC official on the condition of customary anonymity, attributing to the effect of the early voting.The early voting system, adopted in the 2013 by-elections, is different from absentee voting in that it does not require voters to sign up in advance. Eligible voters can simply show up at a polling station during the pre-voting period and cast their ballots.Election officials forecast that the voter turnout could reach 60 percent during the next parliamentary elections four years later if more people are aware of the early voting system.The total turnout rate also includes the results of overseas voting that took place earlier this month in 113 countries worldwide,A total of 63,797 out of 154,217 registered overseas Koreans participated in the six-day poll, resulting in a turnout of 41.4 percent.By region, South Jeolla Province saw the highest voter turnout of 63.7 percent, followed by the administrative city of Sejong, with 63.5 percent.The southeastern industrial city of Daegu recorded the lowest voter turnout with 54.8 percent, trailed by the southern port city of Busan with 55.4 percent, the NEC said.The capital city of Seoul and its surrounding areas, which are forecast to be closely contested, saw a preliminary voter turnout of 59.8 percent.Political and survey analysts say Wednesday's voter turnout affected the outcome of the polls since a higher turnout usually means more young voters participated in the balloting.The opposition parties are traditionally more popular among younger voters, while older voters are more supportive of the conservative ruling party. During the 2004 parliamentary elections, the then-liberal party took the sweeping victory when the turnout rate was 60.6 percent.Meanwhile, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri Party won the next elections in 2008 when the turnout rate marked 46.1 percent.

According to the KCDC, the woman arrived in Korea on April 8, and visited the emergency unit of the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in central Seoul on Wednesday at 2 a.m. after experiencing high fever. The medical staff reported the patient to the KCDC as a suspected case of MERS virus infection.The hospital, however, failed to keep the 22-year-old patient inside the facility. She reportedly returned to her hotel in the central Seoul area at about 3 a.m. The KCDC and the police tracked her down at 7:20 a.m. and sent her to the National Medical Center to be tested for MERS.Her test result was released Wednesday afternoon. A MERS outbreak that occurred in South Korea last year infected 186 and claimed 38 lives here since the first case was reported in May. Since the government declared a formal end to the outbreak in December, some 310 individuals have been reported as suspected MERS patients. Of them, 76 were tested for possible infection, but all the results came out negative, according to the KCDC. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","617":"The Wednesday general election was held in familiar territory when it comes to political parties stoking ideological debate, this time driven by North Korea\u2019s nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier in the year.Controversy persisted over Seoul\u2019s unveiling of the joint arrival of 13 North Korean defectors just days before polls were cast, with the attention returning to how ideological battles during past election seasons played out. In throngs, ruling Saenuri Party contenders chanted calls for stronger security, as the opposition candidates denounced the current foreign policies as having failed.Ideological strife has often held sway in previous elections, though its extent varied. Nearly all presidential polls in democratic Korean history have seen communist-labeling attempts and disclosures of potential spies either by the incumbent administration, challengers or the National Intelligence Service. In other cases, North Korea itself staged an atomic test, missile launch or other provocation, fanning heated debate over how to resolve the nuclear issue and perennial cross-border standoff. In 2012, for instance, the then-ruling Grand National Party had been facing increasingly bitter voter sentiment ahead of the general election, prompting its leadership to change the party\u2019s name to today\u2019s Saenuri Party and vow sweeping reforms. Then Pyongyang fired a long-range rocket about one month before voting began, as calls for tighter security and harsher sanctions ensued. Saenuri Party then won a majority in the National Assembly. The conservative camp was also seen to have benefited from strained inter-Korean relations in the 2008 general election following Pyongyang\u2019s demand to pull South Korean government officials out of the Gaeseong industrial park.The correlation between elections with the North Korean factor was blunter in the more distant past.During the 1997 presidential election, three officials at Cheong Wa Dae were found to have met with those at the North\u2019s Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee in Beijing. They reportedly asked for an armed protest near the armistice line to boost the ratings of the GNP candidate Lee Hoi-chang, supported by President Kim Young-sam at the time. Though the plan had not been realized, it created a nationwide sensation. That year, the Agency for National Security Planning, predecessor to the NIS, also created a stir upon news that it had bribed a Korean-American to disseminate rumors that Kim Dae-jung had fostered ties with North Korean strongman Kim Jong-il. The 1987 bombing of a Korean Air flight by North Korean agent Kim Hyon-hui, which took place about two weeks ahead of a presidential vote, played a key role in the victory of Roh Tae-woo, the front-runner of the ruling Democratic Justice Party. Kim\u2019s transport to Seoul was broadcast live one day before the polling stations opened. In contrast, the Kim Dae-jung administration\u2019s announcement of an inter-Korean summit prior to the 2000 general election backfired, helping consolidate the conservative base and bring defeat to his own progressive camp. Likewise, the liberal Democratic Party swept the 2010 local elections despite the Lee Myung-bak government\u2019s campaign against the North in the wake of its sinking of a South Korean corvette. In recent years, however, ideology debate appears to have relatively waned as democracy takes deeper roots and the economy, welfare and other core issues creep up the agenda. Though the impact of the latest controversy over the uncovering of the 13 defectors will remain impossible to put in numerical terms, critics call for all policymakers and politicians to refrain from attempting to cash in on ideological inclinations as an election tool. \u201cGiven its unprecedented speediness, the joint defection could not have been possible without the relevant agencies\u2019 meticulous planning and preparations,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy research at the Sejong Institute.\u201cSimilar cases involving the agencies\u2019 political intervention may well come about in next year\u2019s presidential election if prevention steps are not taken. ...

In 2005, the top court made a ruling that the criminal accountability of a company could not be transferred to a subsequent company if the original company does not exist. Although Reckitt Benckiser changed the organization type, it was found that the company kept all the shareholders, employees, assets and the name as same. The company was also accused of deleting customers\u2019 complaint posts on its website before prosecutors sought to raid the office in February, raising speculation the company attempted to conceal the fact it had known about the toxicity of the product. The prosecution confirmed that the company had removed hundreds of Oxy Ssak Ssak-related complaints posted from 2001. This was found after prosecutors recovered the seized computer server and used digital forensics to examine it. The complaint posts reportedly included details of aftereffects of using the product, such as breathing difficulties and feeling pressure on the chest.The manufacturer, however, consistently insisted to customers that such symptoms were temporary, the prosecution said. The company was unavailable for comments when contacted by The Korea Herald.U.K.-based company Reckitt Benckiser took over Korean daily supplies company Oxy from Oriental Chemical Industries Group in 2001. The prosecution launched a special probe team in late January to investigate the toxic humidifier disinfectant tragedy that injured at least 221 with lung-related diseases, with 92 killed, since 2011. While more than 500 users initially filed complaints, the Environment Ministry confirmed only 221 cases where a connection between the symptoms and the disinfectant use could be proven. Civic groups, however, have claimed that the number of victims is much greater, citing the strict criteria of the government. The majority of the victims were found to have used Oxy Ssak Ssak, which occupied the majority share of the market for a decade until it was withdrawn from the market in 2011.

But that didn't stop her from wanting to make peace with the first three and a half years of her life, which were spent here with her single mother and then at an orphanage.\"I feel a lot of gratitude, I've done a lot of things, but that was the one thing on my bucket list,\" said Kim, who is now a founding member of the U.S. non-profit organization 325Kamra, which seeks to reunite families through DNA. \"That was the inspiration for searching.\"The search began with a DNA test five years ago. For Kim, her first close match came in October with a relative on her then-unknown American father's side.The match, who turned out to be her cousin's son, helped her trace her lineage to her biological father, whose name was similar to a name she'd seen on her adoption documentations, just spelled differently.\"I figured it was him. Then I contacted the family,\" Kim said.The reaction she got was mixed, as some were welcoming while others would have nothing to do with her. Her deceased father, as she later found out, had planned on marrying her mother and bringing them over to the U.S., but apparently gave up in the face of various administrative hurdles. Interracial marriage was still illegal in most of the U.S. in the late 1950s.\"For me, it's significant because it's knowing your line, knowing your ancestors,\" Kim said. \"To me, it's profound to see his photo and see where I get my nose, to know that I'm part German and Welsh, and I would love nothing more than to learn about my Korean side, what my mother looked like, where she came from.\"Kim was among thousands of children born to American GIs and Korean women working in camp towns near U.S. military bases after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Because the conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, the U.S. has maintained a troop presence here to this date to deter North Korean aggression.Knowing that DNA could be a game changer for adoptees, Kim and several other biracial adoptees who had experienced similar successes came together in September to launch 325Kamra -- 325 being the number of the hotel room they stayed at and Kamra an acronym for Korean Adoptee Mixed Race Association.This month, Kim and 325Kamra President Sarah Savidakis, another mixed-race adoptee, are in Korea to spread the word about their work and collect as many DNA samples as possible with the 300 DNA kits they brought with them.It's all for free, they stress, and the personal information of those who test will be kept within the organization until a significant match emerges, say, within two generations. Names will appear on public databases simply as \"325kamra.\"\"It's not just in Korea that adoption is shrouded in secrecy,\" Kim said. \"It's also in America. In most states, adoption records are sealed. They're not open to adoptees. Historically, it's always been kept in secret.\"Some estimates put the number of biracial adoptees from Korea at more than 4,000 between 1953 and 1965. Data from South Korea's health ministry suggests more than 7,000 mixed-race adoptees were sent abroad by the late 1960s, but that number includes disabled adoptees. To date, about 200,000 Korean children are believed to have been sent for international adoption.In December, Savidakis made a fact-finding trip to Korea during which she met with a 95-year-old Korean woman whose wish was to meet her daughter.She agreed to a DNA test and the result has been uploaded onto American DNA databases for \"match-making.\"The concept is new in South Korea, where DNA testing is only done to prove a relationship between two suspected relatives. In the U.S., however, there are four well-known public databases carrying the DNA of between a quarter of a million and 3 million people. So far, 325Kamra has tested five Koreans.Savidakis, who also found her now-deceased American father and family through DNA, said that while reuniting families is the ideal end result, her organization aims to do more than just that.\"We're also here to collect medical history, because a lot of us have had health issues that's genetically linked,\" she said.For example, the majority of 325Kamra's founding members have had cancer.\"I've had it and I have also had liver issues,\" Savidakis said.\"They (doctors) don't know what's causing it. First thing they ask me is: 'Anybody in your family?' I don't know.\"Biological families may not want to meet adoptees for various reasons. In some cases, the GIs were married and had children before they were dispatched to Korea. The Korean mothers, meanwhile, often suffer from guilt.What Kim and Savidakis both stress, however, is that adoptees are still entitled to their medical histories.\"If I had known there were certain things that were in my medical history, we might have done something that was preventive, and that's what's really important for us, because it's not just for us, but our children,\" Savidakis said. \"We want to keep our children safe. We don't want them to inherit something (and we want to) be more proactive in their health care.\"Anyone who sits down for a DNA test will also be asked to provide information about their medical history.Kim and Savidakis will only be here for a couple of weeks, but there will be others here to continue their work.Kim, who has yet to cross off her wish from her bucket list, made sure to add: \"We would take a photo. So that the adoptee also has a picture of the family member and they would get that as well.\" (Yonhap)","620":"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has no plans to meet with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong, scheduled to visit New York next week for the signing of a U.N. climate agreement, a diplomatic source Tuesday.The U.N. plans to hold the high-level signing ceremony on April 22 for the so-called Paris Agreement adopted in December to replace the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, and the North's Ri is scheduled to attend the ceremony, according to the U.N. spokesman's office.The planned visit drew attention as it would mark Ri's first since tensions spiked following the North's fourth nuclear test in January, its long-range rocket launch in February and the adoption of a new U.N. sanctions resolution last month.The trip could provide opportunities for Ri to hold talks with U.S. officials, such as Kerry, but a diplomatic source said that the top American diplomat has no plans to meet with his North Korean counterpart. The State Department had no comment. Ri last visited New York in September for the U.N. General Assembly. (Yonhap)","621":"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged North Korea on Monday to forgo any provocative actions, warning the U.S. is ready to impose even harsher sanctions than the latest U.N. resolution on the communist nation.Kerry issued the warning at a news conference during a landmark visit to Hiroshima, Japan, amid concerns that Pyongyang could conduct another nuclear test, its fifth, ahead of the birthday of founding leader Kim Il-sung on Friday.He said sentiment was uniform at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the so-called Group of Seven advanced economies.\"Every one of us expressed our concern about the North Korean provocative behavior in recent months,\" Kerry said, according to a transcript provided by his department. \"And together, we issue a call on the DPRK to refrain from actions and rhetoric that further raises the tensions of the region, and instead, to take the necessary, concrete steps towards fulfilling its international commitments and obligations.\"\u00a0Kerry said that \"a few measures\" were left out of the latest U.N. sanctions resolution, but could be enforced in the coming months \"depending on what actions the North decides to take.\" He didn't elaborate on what those measures are, but they're believed to be sanctions deemed too tough for China to agree to.\"So it is still possible that we will ratchet up even more, depending on the actions of the DPRK,\" he said.The U.N. sanctions are believed to be the harshest ever to be imposed on Pyongyang. The measures, among other things, require mandatory inspection of all cargo going into and out of the North, regardless of whether by land, sea or air, while banning its exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources.\"We now have stronger sanctions in place against the DPRK. In addition to that, we have moved to discussions about the potential deployment of THAAD (missile defense system), which is a defensive system, as well as other steps that we are engaged in with respect to North Korea,\" Kerry said. Despite the pressure, however, Kerry said that the U.S. is ready for peace talks with Pyongyang and to provide the impoverished nation with economic aid and other assistance, but the North must first demonstrate its commitment to give up nuclear programs.\"We are prepared to get back to talks. We have made it clear that we are prepared to negotiate a peace treaty on the peninsula.We are prepared to negotiate a non-aggression agreement. We are prepared to actually provide economic assistance and welcome the North back to the community of nations,\" Kerry said. \"We're prepared to provide aid and we're prepared to work with our colleagues on development and the long-term future. We're prepared to work with South Korea on the concept of reunification, if that's what they want. But it all depends on the North making the decision that they will negotiate denuclearization,\" he said.A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity during a background briefing in Japan, said that the U.S. and other members of the six-party nuclear talks with the North are ready to honor a 2005 deal that calls for providing the North with normalization of relations, security guarantees and economic aid.\"But all of that was then and is now conditioned on North Korea moving irreversibly and credibly along the path of full denuclearization. And the sooner that North Korea comes face to face with that, the better for all concerned, including them,\" the official said, according to a State Department transcript.The official also said that there is \"a widespread belief\" that the new U.N. sanctions \"will start to bite on North Korea in a significant way over the coming weeks and months.\" He added that there is a \"considerable amount of work underway about what further options could be deployed, either with or without additional North Korean provocations.\"Kerry's visit to Hiroshima and the memorial to the city's atomic bombing was the first by a U.S. secretary of state. He said he believes \"everyone should visit Hiroshima\" and he hopes President Barack Obama will also do so.Kerry also made a strong pitch for Obama's initiative for a nuclear-free world, and took a swipe at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump for suggesting that South Korea and Japan develop their own nuclear arsenal as a way to reduce U.S. security burdens.\"It is also why any suggestion by any candidate for high public office that we should be building more weapons and giving them to a country like Korea or Japan are absurd on their face and run counter to everything that every president, Republican or Democrat alike, has tried to achieve ever since World War II,\" he said.North Korea, meanwhile, said the international community must remove sanctions before Pyongyang returns to the negotiation table.\"Dialogue and military threats, dialogue and sanctions can never go together. Such logic that the purpose of imposing sanctions is to have a dialogue can never work on the DPRK,\" North Korea's foreign ministry said Tuesday.DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\"Some countries are talking about the six-party talks, simultaneous pushing forward of denuclearization and the conclusion of a peace treaty and the like. Even a mere child knows well that dialogue is impossible under the present tense situation on the peninsula,\" it added.

In South Korea\u2019s capital, this demographic group will make up 31 percent of the total population, showed the report. As of the end of 2015, 1.84 million of 10.02 million citizens in Seoul were aged 60 and over, or 18 percent of citizens. Tokyo topped the world\u2019s list, with an expected 13.2 million individuals aged 60 and above by 2030. This was followed by Osaka, New York, Rhine-Ruhr, London, Los Angeles and Nagoya.The city which is anticipated to have the highest proportion of its population in their 60s is Punta Gorda, Florida, in the U.S., where 57 percent of the population will eventually be of this demographic group. Others in the top five include Orense in Spain, Imabari in Japan, Bradenton in Florida, U.S., and Andong in South Korea\u2019s North Gyeongsang Province. The report also predicted that by 2030, Western Europe will see an overall decline of 10 million people among those aged between 15 and 60. The number will also fall by 5.5 million each in Japan and South Korea.","623":"U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert said Tuesday that Seoul and Washington are firmly committed to democracy through elections, as South Koreans are set to cast their ballots to elect new lawmakers this week.\"One of our key issues in bilateral relationship is our shared commitment to democracy in the elections,\" Lippert said in a congratulatory speech to mark the start of the 2016 Seoul International Forum on Elections held in Seoul.South Koreans go to the polls Wednesday to elect 300 lawmakers for four-year terms, while the U.S presidential election is scheduled for November 2016.Lippert said that the two countries will cooperate to improve electoral standards and reduce fraud in the election process. The forum is co-hosted by South Korea's election watchdog, the National Election Commission (NEC), and the South Korea-led Association of World Election Bodies (A-WEB) and run for two days.Among the attendees to the forum are Lippert, South Korean National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, NEC Secretary General Kim Yong-hi, as well as officials from international election bodies from around the world, the NEC said.\"Your presence here is meaningful to our shared values and commitment and shared goals,\" the envoy said, noting election officials' commitment to making elections transparent and clean.Speaker Chung also encouraged people to cast their ballot on Wednesday's polls, saying that the election is \"the flower of democracy.\"\"Procedural legitimacy of the democracy can be achieved when the election is carried out in an impartial and free manner,\" Chung said in his congratulatory remarks.On the first day, the attendees will discuss the role of citizens in improving democracy and how to inspire more women to be politicians, the commission said.The participants will then visit polling stations in central Seoul on Wednesday to watch the voting and the vote-counting process, officials said.A-WEB was first proposed by Seoul in 2011 and launched two years later with the participation of more than 102 countries. The organization aims to establish fair elections in developing nations by helping them build the necessary legal framework and infrastructure.","624":"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong plans to visit New York next week to attend the signing of a landmark U.N. climate agreement, a U.N. official said Monday.The U.N. plans to hold a high-level signing ceremony on April 22 for the so-called Paris Agreement adopted in December to replace the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, and the North's Ri is scheduled to attend the ceremony, an official of the U.N. spokesman's office said.Ri attended the Paris conference and delivered a speech there.His visit to New York would mark his first since tensions spiked following the North's fourth nuclear test in January, its long-range rocket launch in February and the adoption of a new U.N. sanctions resolution.He could also meet with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, but the spokesman's office said that no such meeting has been fixed.Ri last visited New York in September for the U.N. General Assembly.The trip could provide opportunities for Ri to hold talks with U.S. officials, though such chances are low considering the international community's ongoing efforts to increase pressure on Pyongyang.Seoul's Foreign Ministry refused to comment on Ri's reported plan to visit New York, saying that it is \"not in a position\" to discuss the issue.Experts raised the possibility that through Ri's visit to the U.N., the reclusive state may seek to create momentum for dialogue with the United States and find a way out of its deepening isolation and stringent international sanctions.\"Wouldn't Ri's planned visit to the U.S. be a signal for dialogue?\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. \"By raising the issue of dialogue, the North could move to turn the situation -- currently focusing on sanctions -- into one that is favorable for dialogue so as to cause a crack in the international cooperation over applying sanctions on the North,\" he added.A source familiar with North Korean affairs pointed out that after all, Ri's visit might be intended to show to the international community that the North is still faring well despite international sanctions and isolation.

Schilling also said that if the current ground test program continues and is successful, flight tests of a North Korean ICBM could \"begin in as little as a year\" and Pyongyang may be able to deploy this delivery system in a limited operational capability by 2020.\"North Korea's April 9 test of a large liquid-fuel engine is a disturbing development that not only highlights the growing threat posed by Pyongyang but should also put to rest, once and for all, all claims that the North's WMD programs are a hoax,\" he said. \"In fact, the test demonstrated that North Korea has an even greater capability at a more advanced state of development than previously anticipated,\" he added.

He imagined that she would wake him up with a cup of coffee, prepare breakfast and pack him a box of fruits for a snack. In reality, his wife wakes up, grabs juice from the refrigerator and rushes to the office while touching up her makeup on the subway.\u201cI think it would be too boring to stay at home as a housewife,\u201d his wife had said to him.Kim\u2019s ideal morning is becoming less conventional in South Korea, with more than two thirds of 300,000 married couples last year consisting of wives who work, according to statistics released Monday.123rfStatistics Korea said that more couples are working together to make a living, mainly to secure double incomes amid rising economic burdens as well as a higher employment rate among women who are of marriageable age.The number of women who got married while unemployed was 102,915 last year, a 4.7 percent drop from the year before. The number has been dropping since 2011, according to Statistics Korea. The decline was 4.2 percent in 2011, 8.6 percent in 2012, 6.3 percent in 2013 and 10.2 percent in 2014.The ratio of marriages involving unemployed women also continued to fall, with it making up 34.0 percent of all marriages last year, compared to 54.0 percent in 2005.Statistics Korea explained that the trend is also attributable to more people choosing to get married later in life.According to data, in 2015 the average age of women and men who got married for the first time was 30 years old and 32.6 years old, respectively. Meanwhile, among women in their late 20s and early 30s, 68.6 percent and 59.8 percent were employed, respectively. The figures were at 63 percent and 48.6 percent respectively in 2005.\u201cWith the continuing economic crisis, marrying at an early age seems like a loss to me, since I would have to contribute my time and money to my new family including my parents-in-law,\u201d said a 29-year-old office worker surnamed Kim.Analysts pointed out that as women become better educated and enter the workforce, they have greater desire to embrace both family and work.\u201cUnlike conventional thought, the main nurturer of a child does not necessarily have to be a woman,\u201d child psychology therapist Kwon Yoon-soon told The Korea Herald.She said, \u201cThe quality of time spent with children is more important than the number of hours spent at home nurturing. It is definitely possible for the family to benefit from a working mother as long as they can manage a stable source of nurturing.\u201d In this way, the social pressure felt by involuntary stay-at-home mothers can also be prevented, she added.

The North Korean workers at the restaurant reportedly disappeared early last week and arrived in the South on Thursday.\u00a0 Others, however, said that China did not need to offer any \"diplomatically risky\" assistance to the defectors since they all held legitimate passports, with which they could purchase flight tickets and leave China without any legal problems.Citing diplomatic concerns, the Seoul government has refused to confirm whether the restaurant where the 13 defectors worked was located in China. The defection came as Beijing has vowed to fully enforce international sanctions that the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) adopted early last month to punish Pyongyang's latest provocations -- a move that the North said is tantamount to succumbing to America's political pressure.The sanctions include the mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North and a ban on the North's export of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a crucial source of hard currency for the impoverished country.The North's overseas restaurants have also been cited as an important source of revenue. As part of its standalone sanctions on the North, the South has recently called on its tourists to refrain from using North Korean overseas restaurants.\u00a0 Pyongyang is known to operate some 130 restaurants in 12 countries, including China, Russia, Myanmar and Vietnam, as well as Hong Kong, raking in huge sums of money annually. Nearly 100 of the restaurants are in China. (Yonhap)","629":"A group of North Korean defectors who used to work at a restaurant in China entered South Korea last week via Thailand and Laos, a source familiar to North Korean affairs said Monday.Thirteen North Korean workers at an overseas restaurant defected to South Korea en masse last week amid toughened international sanctions on Pyongyang over its latest nuclear and missile tests.The source said that the North Koreans who worked at a restaurant in the Chinese eastern port city of Ningbo flew into Bangkok early last week and moved to Laos taking a land route. In Vientiane, they left for Seoul late Wednesday and arrived here the next day, it said.The government has declined to comment on their defection route and other details, citing the issue's sensitivity and diplomatic aspects.Seoul's unification ministry on Friday made an unusual announcement about their mass defections in a breakaway from its low-key stance on the issue of North Korean defectors.North Korean restaurants have served as one of the main sources of dollars for North Korea, which is suspected of bankrolling the North's nuclear and missile programs.Many restaurants run by North Korea have recently faced business hardships, with some shutting down following stronger international sanctions.Seoul also has asked its nationals not to use North Korean restaurants in China and Southeast Asian nations in a bid to hit the source of income for Pyongyang.North Koreans at overseas restaurants are among some 50,000 workers sent abroad by the regime to earn hard currency, a move aimed at averting a series of past U.N. sanctions.South Korea estimates that North Korea is running approximately130 restaurants in some 12 countries including China, Vietnam and Cambodia, earning $10 million annually.Meanwhile, the government is under fire for its rare announcement of the North Koreans' defection as critics said that Seoul is seeking to influence the upcoming general elections slated for Wednesday in its favor.The ruling party and the government often highlight North Korea-related news to raise awareness about security ahead of key elections, a move to rally conservative and security-concerned voters.Seoul's unification ministry denied a local newspaper's report that Cheong Wa Dae ordered the government to make public the latest mass defection.\"(From now on), the government can unveil further cases of defections if they are unprecedented and meaningful,\" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.He declined to confirm whether there are more North Koreans at the same restaurant on a waiting list for defection.

The organizers expect 90 percent will be sold, generating 174 billion won in revenue. The POCOG said that 70 percent of the tickets will be sold in South Korea.\"We have been working on ticket prices since October 2014,\" the POCOG Secretary General Yeo Hyung-koo said in a press conference.\"We have discussed with each federation and our government before receiving final approval from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\"The POCOG said ticket prices for its 15 disciplines will range from 20,000 won to 900,000 won.

They decided to have cheap ticket prices for sports that are relatively unpopular in South Korea, such as biathlon and luge, in a bid to draw more local fans.Local war veterans and disabled people will receive 50 percent discounts, but Eom said that the organizers are not planning to give special discounts to others and there will be no free tickets because that is against the IOC policy. The organizers said that tickets will be sold on the POCOG's official website starting in October. Those in South Korea can go to the POCOG's official website and people overseas can purchase their tickets through an authorized ticket reseller (ATR) in their country.The PyeongChang organizers said that the ticket prices for the Paralympic Winter Games will be announced early next year.

An outcome of a memorandum of understanding in maritime transport and logistics signed between the two leaders last year, the event will gather a Korean delegation of over 50 companies and government branches. Participating institutions include the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea Polar Research Institute, Korean Register, Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, Korea Institute of Marine Science and Technology Promotion, Korean Marine Environment Management Corporation and Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering.\u00a0(From left on the table) Indian Chamber of Commerce in Korea chairman Dilip Sundaram, Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami, director general of the overseas fisheries and international policy bureau at the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries Cho Shin-hee and vice chairman of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Korea Parth Sharma.

Korea\u2019s shipbuilding and maritime logistics industries having been in dire straits, the venue will introduce blue oceans.\u201dIndia has had a rich heritage of overseas trade with Asia and Africa, using ports of Tamralipta, Poompuhar, Muziris, Kozhikode and Dwarka, noted Parth Sharma, vice chairman of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Korea. \u201cRivers were the lifelines of our economy, while ports acted as gateways to India for foreigners and foreign goods.\u201d The country has over 7,500 kilometers of coastline, across and around which coal, cement, petroleum, oil and lubricants, food grains, steel and fertilizers are transported. Its five inland waterways have a navigable network of 14,500 kilometers, key to hinterland production and relief on road and railway congestion. Currently, four waterways are being built along the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi and Buckingham Canal, and one is in operation between Haldia and Farakka. Through inland waterway development -- worth over $19 billion -- logistics costs would be significantly lowered over the next seven years by over $4 billion, according to the vice chairman.Vice chairman of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Korea Parth Sharma (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)\u201cIndia is looking for a long-term partnership with Korea in the maritime sector, as Korea is a global logistics hub with the world\u2019s fourth-largest throughput at 25 million 20-foot (6 meters) equivalents,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cKorea is a world leader in marine technologies, manufacturing, education and training, with a 30 percent international market share in shipbuilding, ship repair and ship recycling.\u201d For foreign investors, the government provides various incentives, including a viability gap funding using public private partnership; a 70 percent abatement on service tax for coastal shipping; 10 consecutive years of tax holidays for infrastructure development; exemption on customs and central excise duties; endowment of infrastructure status to shipyards; shipbuilding subsidies; and simplified immigration procedures for cruise shipping. The flagship \u201cSagarmala\u201d scheme -- involving over 150 projects worth $19 billion -- targets port modernization, improved hinterland connectivity, coastal community development and port-led industrialization. With a plan to increase cargo from 1 billion of \u201cmillion tons per annum\u201d to 2.5 billion by 2025, the initiative covers greenfield ports, roads, railways and pipelines, multimodal logistics hub, inland waterways, port-linked clusters and maritime tourism. \u201cIn the last couple of years, India has initiated 15 to 20 projects annually in port development, which were owned by Dubai, Singapore and Dutch port authorities,\u201d Sharma pointed out. \u201cThere are at least 55 ships under construction in India right now, but Korea has been absent.\u201dIndia has some 1,200 commercial ships, 40 percent of which are over 20 years old, compared to the average life span of 26 years. For upgrading or repair, most ships go to Colombo, Sri Lanka or Singapore.In shipbuilding, over 95 percent of production is naval, and less than 5 percent is commercial in India, which is the opposite of Korea. While explaining that most components in shipbuilding are the same, except weapons and military-related hardware, Doraiswami said: \u201cIn the defense industry, we want Korea to increase our scale of manufacturing in vessel components. The entire logistics chain in Korea, which is so efficient, will meet huge opportunities in India.\u201dBy Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","632":"A Korean victim of sexual slavery by Japanese troops during World War II residing in China was moved to Seoul for medical treatment, officials said Sunday. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said 88-year-old Ha Sang-sook, the only Korean sexual slavery victim living in Wuhan, China, arrived at Chung-Ang University Medical Center in Seoul to treat her injured lungs.In early February, she broke a rib after she fell down the stairs from the second floor, leading to lung inflammation and rendering her unconsciousness.\u00a0(Yonhap)A Korean medical team was dispatched to China earlier this month to check her health condition and review the possibilities of bringing her to Seoul for long-term medical treatment. While she gradually recovered consciousness, she is still in a serious state, the medical staff said. Upon the medical team\u2019s approval, Ha was moved to Seoul with her 63-year-old stepdaughter and granddaughter. At the age of 17 in 1944, Ha was taken to China by Japanese authorities and forced into sexual enslavement. Despite Korea\u2019s liberation in 1945, she was unable to return to her home country and sustained her life as a factory worker in Wuhan. She later married a Chinese man who already had three daughters, but declined to become naturalized as a Chinese citizen, despite her stateless status. Although Ha recovered her Korean citizenship in 1999 and finally returned to Korea in 2003, she went back to China after 2 1\/2 years upon the persuasion of her youngest stepdaughter. She also had difficulties in adjusting to her new life in Korea without any acquaintances here, the ministry said. Her medical trip was led and sponsored by both the public and private sectors.Korean Air offered a medium-size airplane to ensure enough space for Ha\u2019s sickbed. Chinese authorities also allowed Ha\u2019s ambulance to skip the check-in procedures for prompt transportation. Ha will immediately receive a medical check-up to find out whether surgery is necessary, the Seoul authorities said. The Korean government has provided a monthly stipend of 1.2 million won ($1,040) for sexual slavery victims since 1993. After Ha\u2019s case came to light, authorities and a local nonprofit organization have covered all her medical expenses since the injury. The victim is also not subject to the Chinese government\u2019s medical benefits, due to her nationality.

Ha has reportedly told her family consistently that she would like to spend the rest of her life in her home country.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","633":"In the wake of last week\u2019s mass defection, additional exoduses may come about among North Koreans working overseas as the impact of U.N. resolutions and unilateral sanctions takes shape, top Seoul officials said Sunday. A group of a male manager in his 30s and 12 female employees in their early 20s who had served at a North Korean restaurant arrived in Seoul on Thursday, the Unification Ministry announced late Friday. Officials declined to unveil the detailed time line of their journey or the location of the diner, citing diplomatic sensitivity, but they were believed to have departed from China on Wednesday or Thursday and flown via a Southeast Asian nation.\u00a0This image shows the 13 North Koreans who defected to the South last week after having worked at a restaurant outside their homeland. (Unification Ministry)Contrary to earlier news reports, the 13 were \u201ca sizable portion\u201d of the restaurant\u2019s staff, but \u201cnot everyone,\u201d a senior ministry official said, indicating that some others left there may be hoping to follow suit -- or already be on their way here. \u201cThere are some remaining people who could not come. ... Circumstantially they would seek to, but their precise whereabouts right now cannot be verified, in addition to safety concerns,\u201d the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity.\u00a0The rare case reflects the budding effects of global pressure and South Korea\u2019s recent appeal to its citizens to refrain from using any profit-making North Korean facilities abroad, which it has labeled as cash-generating tools for the Kim Jong-un regime, officials said. According to the ministry, one female server said during questioning, \u201cI\u2019ve come to escape to Seoul where there is hope, as sanctions intensified recently and I lost hope for the North Korean system.\u201d Another defector also said, \u201cI\u2019d developed a desire to live as a South Korean after gaining knowledge about South Korea\u2019s democracy while watching TV shows and dramas overseas.\u201d \u201cPyongyang\u2019s demands for foreign currency despite strengthening sanctions, their overseas lives with relatively easier access to outside information, especially our broadcasts and the Internet that portray freedom and South Korean culture, and the factors alike, have apparently come together to compel them to defect, with the recent sanctions and consequent difficulties providing a more direct (motive),\u201d the official said.\u00a0Signs are growing that the sanctions have already started to hold sway, they said. All six flag-on-convenience ships blacklisted by the latest U.N. Security Council resolution have been deregistered from the International Maritime Organization, while the remaining 21 North Korean flag boats have returned home and remain grounded there since being denied entry to China, Russia, Hong Kong and other ports, vessel tracking websites show. About half of the approximately 130 North Korean restaurants, which would collectively deposit around $10 million a year in state coffers, are believed to be struggling to meet their quota, some resorting to illicit sex services and supplementary food sales to court more customers and boost revenues, the ministry official noted. More companies in China and elsewhere are seen shying away from dealing with their North Korean counterparts. In some regions bordering with China, the prices of rice and other staples have increased over the last month, he added, quoting intelligence sources.\u00a0Given Seoul\u2019s longstanding low-profile approach to the issue of bringing in defectors from a third country, the ministry\u2019s unusual impromptu announcement sparked speculation over a potential policy shift toward a more open, proactive one. But another senior official at the Foreign Ministry reaffirmed the existing strategy, though he raised the need to reinforce collaboration with other countries such as China and those in Southeast Asia for future mass exoduses. \u201cThe government has decided to unwrap the latest case due to its rarity and implications on recent sanctions. Our stance toward quiet cooperation remains unchanged,\u201d he said at a separate meeting with reporters. \u201cWe have made our position clear to relevant countries that the defectors must come to South Korea according to their free will, and not be repatriated to the North against their will. But there is a need for stronger cooperation with those countries, as we can\u2019t rule out the possibility for further group defections as the sanctions and pressure drive kicks into high gear.\u201dThis photo carried Saturday by North Korea`s Rodong Sinmun appears to have been taken during what state media claimed was a test of a new engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. (Yonhap)He also warned against an additional military provocation by Pyongyang, referring to the recent string of Kim\u2019s threats to test more nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missOn Saturday, state media claimed the young ruler has supervised an experiment of a new higher-power engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland at the Sohae station in the western town of Dongchang. \u201cAs expressed through our recent summits with the U.S., China and Japan, the North would face evens greater sanctions pressure should it stage another provocation. There is consensus in particular between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo for stronger sanctions,\u201d the diplomat added.

According to the latest RFA report, the factory chimneys are sending up clouds of smoke only occasionally because the country is having a hard time procuring materials and fuel.The source also said that North Korean students and ordinary citizens are mobilized to collect scrap metal, but the amount brought in is not enough to keep operations moving forward.More recently, North Korean media made a propaganda report that many people in the country including Jagang Province and Nampo city have collected some scrap irons and provided them to metal factories in the country.Another source in the country's northeastern province said that North Korea's dependence on outside raw materials and fuel has increased, despite the regime's propaganda machine claiming the country is self-sufficient in its procurement of fuel and major raw materials.North Korea has persistently argued that the Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex, employing 25,000 workers, is where \"Juche (self-reliant) steel\" is produced and the mill is a bright symbol of the country's self-revitalization.

But now, the Asian country is one that he wants to associate with to spur his ministry's digitalization scheme.During a recent interview with Korean reporters in Paris, Place said that he has now \"reconciled with\" his fatherland, which he struggled to push aside under the threshold of his consciousness after being adopted by a French couple in 1975.The minister plans to visit Seoul next month to consult with Korean experts and officials to help catalyze his ministry's \"France Connect\" project, an initiative to capitalize on Internet technologies to digitize state administrative affairs.\"Candidly speaking, I had lived in pain with the feelings of betrayal and abandonment as I came to France from an orphanage (inKorea) when I was only seven and a half years old,\" he said in the interview.But the deep-seated psychological pains subsided after he revisited the orphanage in 2011, where he was welcomed wholeheartedly by Koreans there. Since then, he has visited his homeland once or twice each year to meet with Korean friends.\"I have made good Korean friends, and (through the friends) I have now reconciled with the country,\" he said. \"I go to Korean restaurants (in France) at least once or twice a week, meaning that I have come to feel love and affection for Korea.\"The present-day Korea is incomparable to what it was in the 1970s, he said, praising the country's economic achievements.\"While it sticks to its economic development and tradition, Korea has achieved the modern development perfectly. I think Korea and Koreans are very outstanding,\" he said. \"I give my praise for Koreans' dynamic activities.\"Place cast himself as \"100 percent\" French. But he said due to his personal ties to Korea, he has a role to play in enhancing the relationship between the two countries. \"I think I cannot help but play a role in helping the bilateral relationship,\" he said. The minister, in particular, has striven to help Korean students secure better accommodations in France and Korean immigrants smoothly settle in the county.Citing former French President Nicolas Sarkozy's statement that he engaged in politics so as to return what he had received from his country, Place said that he himself wants to follow suit.Place reportedly began his political career in 1993 as an aide to a lawmaker. He was elected to the French Senate in 2011, becoming the first Korean-born person to take the political post.He formerly served as vice secretary-general of the Green Party.

She recently regained consciousness after receiving treatment in an intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan, a city where she resides in China's Hubei Province. But she is having difficulty breathing, as the broken rib has sparked an infection in her lung, government officials said. South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and Consulate General in Wuhan said on Friday that they decided to have her treated at ChungAng University Hospital in Seoul upon request from her family in China.Her transfer to Seoul was scheduled after a team of doctors from the hospital visited her early this month for her diagnosis and judged it would be no problem to move her to South Korea.

Nike Korea removed the sneakers from its stores last month after the controversy.\u201cWe understand the sensitivity of this issue and we apologize for any offense caused. The Air Jordan 12 will no longer be sold in Korea,\u201d Nike Korea told The Korea Herald in a statement. But Koreans are left wondering what the leading sportswear company\u2019s position is on the contentious design.Seo Kyoung-duk, professor of general education at Sungshin Women\u2019s University, sent a letter of complaint to Nike and Michael Jordan about the matter but he has yet to receive a reply.\u201cAlthough Nike Korea issued an apology and stopped selling it in Korea, it is still being retailed all over the world. Imperial Japan inflicted pain upon many Asian countries; It is not just a matter between Seoul and Tokyo,\u201d said Seo, adding he will continue raising the issue to Nike.Retired basketballer Jordan remains one of the most popular sports icons in the world, as do his famous sneakers. The original version of the Air Jordan 12 was worn by the NBA legend during the 1996-97 season after the Chicago Bulls achieved an all-time high of 72 wins, a record that still stands today. But fans in Korea have expressed disappointment with their hero for remaining silent on the controversial sensitive issue.\u201cIf Jordan knew about the Rising Sun flag and the historical relationship between Korea and Japan but chose to remain silent anyway, I am disappointed in him,\u201d said 34-year-old basketball fan Jang Jae-ah. \u201cThe Japanese colonialism is long over, but its aftereffects are an ongoing issue in Korea.\u201dScars of colonialismKorea and Japan remain at odds over how to view Japan\u2019s crimes during World War II, namely Japan\u2019s sexual slavery of women from Korea and other parts of Asia for its soldiers. The Seoul government recently asked Tokyo to revise its history textbooks to clarify that the victims -- euphemistically called \u201ccomfort women\u201d -- were forced into sexual slavery and that their human rights were infringed upon.The 44 surviving comfort women are a testament to the lasting scars left by Japan\u2019s 1910-45 colonialization of Korea, making any reminder of Japanese imperialism a taboo in Korean society.Earlier in the year, Maison Kitsune stirred up controversy by using designs bearing images of the Rising Sun flag, after which the French fashion label issued an official apology. Some local celebrities have also came under fire for wearing clothes bearing the controversial design.\u201cSome people talk of freedom of expression in wearing such designs. But I think there\u2019s a limit to such freedom, and a historically important matter should be an exception,\u201d said 20-year-old Yoon Yeong-bin who attends Hansung University in Seoul.\u201cI think people wearing such designs lack a sense of history. There is no present without the past. Freedom of expression? It\u2019s nonsense,\u201d said Jang.Depicting the sun and its rays, the Rising Sun flag dates back to the ancient Edo period (1603-1868) when it was used by Japanese warlords. In 1870, the Meiji government adopted it as the war flag of its army and subsequently as the symbol of its navy. The flag was used by the Japanese military during World War II when Japan invaded Asian countries in the 1940s.It is now used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, but it is more commonly used by the general public and in commercial products as it has traditionally meant good fortune and vigor. Despite the widespread controversy, the retro Air Jordans were also a massive hit in Korea. A visit to a Nike store in Seoul in early March showed that nearly all the sneakers had been sold, except small sizes for children. As of Tuesday, it is being sold online at prices as high as 470,000 won ($406), more than double its retail price.\u201cAir Jordan collectors may find it hard to give up on their collection just because of the design. They may justify their choices by saying that it was probably not inspired by the Rising Sun flag because a U.S.-based company designed it,\u201d said a 41-year-old basketball fan.Nazi swastika and the Rising Sun Many who oppose the use of the Rising Sun flag compare it to the Nazi swastika, which was a religious symbol until Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany adopted it as their emblem. Since then, it has become highly stigmatized due to its association with Nazism. Lee Jang-hie, professor emeritus of law at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said the difference in the two symbols lies in the differing attitudes and actions of Germany and Japan after the war. \u201cMost of the German war criminals were prosecuted at the Nuremberg trials, and Germany itself saw to it that punishments would be implemented. Also they worked hard to ensure that symbols, writings and propaganda linked to the Nazis would be taboo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, many of the (Japanese) war criminals were released to play prominent roles in Japan\u2019s political, economic, academic circles as well as the media.\u201dAmong those not prosecuted was Nobusuke Kishi, grandfather of incumbent Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \u201cYou can say that Japan has failed to fully part ways with its militaristic past,\u201d Lee said.He said that the new history textbooks in Japan that glorify \u201cKamikaze\u201d suicide fighters and condone symbols like the Rising Sun flag is part of the country\u2019s attempt to justify its past.\u201cThrough their efforts to punish those related to Nazism, Germany managed to regain trust from the international society and is playing a crucial part in the EU. ... Japan, on the other hand, is trying to water down its imperial past,\u201d he said.Surveys indicate that neighboring countries in Northeast Asia remain discontented with one another.Last year, Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry conducted a survey on 14 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. It showed that 77 percent of Japanese disliked China and 41.7 percent of Chinese had no affection for Japan. Another survey by Seoul Digital University last month showed that 86.1 percent of its students said that Korea and Japan have a bad relationship. Professor Seo said that the biggest problem behind the use of the Rising Sun symbol is that foreigners do not think that it is an issue at all.\u201cThe Japanese national team uniform in the 2014 FIFA World Cup had a design resembling a Rising Sun flag. The symbol is being used in fields that are most exposed to the general public, and most people do not recognize what it stood for. ... Many foreigners think that it is just a design that is often used in Japan,\u201d he said.\u201cJapan\u2019s intent may be to include imperialistic symbols into cultural content to promote them, so the general public will openly accept them,\u201d said Seo. Even some Koreans fail to recognize the meaning of the controversial design, pointed out Seo.Hansung student Yoon said she did not know what exactly the Rising Sun flag represented until a controversy involving a local celebrity broke out. \u201cWe (Korea) need to step up education not only on history, but also on how to address outside attempts to distort historical facts,\u201d Seo said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","641":"South Koreans can begin casting their ballots during the preliminary voting period for the April 13 parliamentary elections later this week, the state election office said Thursday.The preliminary voting will kick off on Friday for a two-day run at 3,511 polling stations across the country, the National Election Commission said.Voters are required to carry a valid form of photo identification and visit a nearby polling station between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., the NEC said.The NEC additionally set up polling stations at public facilities such as the country's main gateway, Incheon International Airport, and two main train stations in central Seoul.The commission first adopted the system during the April by-election in 2013 as part of its effort to boost the voter turnout rate.

This week, China, the North's diplomatic and economic lifeline, imposed restrictions on North Korean coal and iron ore trade, while banning imports of North Korean gold and rare earth, in line with new U.N. sanctions against the North's nuclear and missile programs. In a statement released on Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the Chinese measures \"appear to be a step toward in following through on\" China's pledge in enforcing the U.N. sanctions on North Korea. \"We will continue to urge China to do more until we see concrete signs that Kim Jong-un has come to the realization that the only viable path forward for his country is denuclearization,\" it said. The U.N. Security Council adopted a set of new sanctions against North Korea early last month, in the aftermath of the North's fourth nuclear test in January and launch of a long-range rocket in February. China accounts for nearly 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade estimated at US$7.6 billion in 2014. Coal and iron ore are key parts of bilateral trade between North Korea and China, but the U.N. sanctions have an exception that allows trade of such items unless the proceeds are used for the North's nuclear and missile programs. Chinese officials have pledged to fully implement the U.N. sanctions, but also stressed that it should not affect normal trade between the allies. In an editorial on Friday, state-run China Daily newspaper said the Chinese restrictions of trade with North Korea \"should be a welcome indication that Beijing is serious about its vow to 'conscientiously' implement the sanctions.\" Although North Korea has shown no signs of giving up its nuclear ambitions, China has proposed pursuing peace treaty talks with the North in tandem with denuclearization negotiations. Signing a peace treaty, which would replace the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War, has been one of Pyongyang's long-running goals, but South Korea and the U.S. have demanded the North abandon its nuclear program first.The Chinese newspaper was also skeptical about the prospects of reviving talks with North Korea. \"So no matter how hard Beijing works to revive talks, it will not happen until Pyongyang convinces the others of its sincerity about denuclearization. Something that appears unlikely at present,\" the editorial reads. \"Beijing should avoid playing into Pyongyang's hands by single-mindedly advocating for peace. Peace-brokering should never be at the price of appeasing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions,\" it said.\u00a0(Yonhap)","643":"This is the first installment in a series of articles that look at South Korea\u2019s pet culture and industry. \u2013Ed.Stay-at-home mother Cho Young-ai has endured painful treatments to fight cancer for the past three years, but luckily two companion animals have given her a great deal of emotional support and strength to survive. \u201cWhen I was ill and isolated in a rural area, I felt relieved to see my dogs wagging their tails as if everything was going to be just fine,\u201d the 51-year-old told The Korea Herald. \u201cThe dogs were a part of the reason I forced myself to get well.

It also stipulated a ban on animal abuse or inhumane slaughter. After the bill was revised in 2011, the punishment for those violating the law increased from 5 million won ($4,300) or a six-month jail term to 10 million won or a one-year prison term. In January, animals rights group Animal Arirang launched a petition on major web portal Daum to include clauses related to animal rights in the Constitution. \u201cIf rules about animal protection and welfare are added in the Constitution, it will prevent anti-animal actions such as abuse,\u201d the group said. As of Wednesday, 1,801 individuals had signed the petition. In 2015, 12 out of 58 bills related to protecting animals passed through the National Assembly. Several bills for the expansion of the pet registration system and tougher punishments for animal abuse are pending in the parliament. Cho pointed out that one of the major achievements in Korea\u2019s fight for animal rights was a passage of the anti-animal testing bill. The bill is to ban companies from testing cosmetics and other products on animals by 2018. \u201cKorea began to talk about animal welfare in zoos and tougher penalties for those abusing animals,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on what we have achieved, society should move forward to better implement the law and institutions in reality. Pet lovers have spurred the pet industry, with the government estimating that the market was worth 1.8 trillion won in 2015. If it grows at the current pace, the market will be worth 5.8 billion won by 2020. These days, companies are scrambling to roll out services such as medical insurance, nursing system, funeral ceremonies and TV programs about animal welfare. A slew of events for families and their pets are also being hosted by municipalities. For instance, Gangwon Pet Festival, which will involve pets and their owners in activities such as running a race and a dancing class, will be held on Sunday. A similar event is scheduled for May 7 in Seongnam City. The government also founded a task force team encompassing relevant ministries and animal advocacy groups to lay out detailed plans and a budget to improve conditions for animals in the country. It plans to mandate training centers, animal cafes and beauty salons for dogs to register with the government before they open for business.

South Korea \"has been closely following (the development) of the 300-mm MLRS for three years,\" Defense Ministry Han Min-koo said in an interview with local journalists. \"Recently, North Korea test-fired the system several times, through which, I believe, it has nearly completed the development,\"Han said, referring to the North's multiple MLRS launches carried out in March.\"Under this assessment, I think North Korea will deploy the 300-mm MLRS as early as at the end of this year,\" according to the minister.Accurate MLRS weapons are a cheaper alternative to North Korea's arsenal of more expensive ballistic missiles, notably its short-range Scud missiles, the ministry highlighted.The exact accuracy and the destructive power of the weapon system needs to be studied further, but the new MLRS with extended range and guidance systems is different from previous long-range artillery munitions, he pointed out.Still, South Korea is fully capable of defending against potential MLRS attacks because the country has consistently upgraded its counter-artillery countermeasures, according to the defense chief.The communist country is also likely to carry out another nuclear test as the country stands technically ready to do so at any time, Han said, repeating his ministry's recent assessment.\"It is not, to be sure, a final assessment, but our observation of North Korea's nuclear test tunnels shows that a nuclear test is possible as soon as the leadership makes a decision,\" he said. Han also cited the North Korean leader's recent order to conduct \"a nuclear warhead test\" last month as additional backup of his assessment. In March, North Korea sharply increased its military ante against Seoul and Washington in protest against the allies' joint military exercises that run through April.North Korea has threatened to launch strikes on the capital Seoul and the presidential house, Cheong Wa Dae, in a series of bellicose rhetoric, which also included claims that the country developed missile re-entry technology and made key strides in regards to its nuclear warheads.The unusually virulent rhetoric indicates how seriously intimidated North Korea is by the international sanctions imposed on it after the country's nuclear and long-range missile tests in January and February, respectively, the defense chief said.\"Kim is also (using the threats) as a means of solidifying his leadership and flaunting his audacity internally,\" Han added.

(Yonhap)","646":"BEIJING (AP)\u00a0-- China imposed restrictions Tuesday on imports of coal from North Korea and exports of jet fuel to the North in a potentially significant increase in pressure on Pyongyang following U.N. sanctions over its nuclear and missile tests.  China is the impoverished and politically isolated North\u2018s main trading partner, making its cooperation essential for penalties approved by the U.N. Security Council last month to succeed. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified nuclear activities this year in defiance of U.N. sanctions, conducting his country\u2019s fourth nuclear test explosion in January and test-firing missiles. Last month, the Security Council responded by approving sanctions including inspections of cargo bound to and from North Korea. On March 19, it called on all countries to ``redouble their efforts\u2018\u2019 to enforce sanctions against the North. The latest Chinese measures ban most imports of North Korean coal, iron, iron ore, gold, titanium, vanadium and rare earths. Such products are a key source of revenue for the mineral-rich North. The Ministry of Commerce said an exception would be allowed for materials for civilian use so long as they are not connected to the North\u2018s nuclear or missile programs. The announcement also banned sales of jet fuel to North Korea, which might ground Pyongyang\u2019s state-owned airline, Air Koryo. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing had no immediate comment. Beijing has balked at previous demands by Washington and other governments to use trade as leverage against North Korea. Chinese diplomats have said the potential humanitarian impact of sanctions had to be considered. Many analysts believe Chinese leaders are reluctant to impose crippling sanctions on North Korea for fear of destabilizing Kim\u2018s government and setting off a possible flood of refugees.","647":"Employees head to their offices in a building in Seoul. (Yonhap)One thing that surprised Tyler Kim when he joined a South Korean company last year after nine years of working in the U.S. was that his coworkers called him \u201cchaekimnim,\u201d a direct translation of his job title, manager.\u201cIt was a bit awkward at first,\u201d he said, since it was the first time he was not called by his name at work.Hierarchy has been a key aspect of corporate governance worldwide. But it means more when it comes to the Korean corporate culture notorious for its top-down approach and rigidity. Society that ranks everythingWhen exchanging business cards, Koreans give particular attention to titles, as it reflects the person\u2019s job type, rank, experience and social status. Inside the effective palm-sized card lies Koreans\u2019 deep-seated awareness of acknowledging one another\u2019s social cachet. It is also a surefire way of figuring out what level of person someone is dealing with.Experts say Koreans generally prefer to deal only with someone of equal rank.\u201cKoreans tend to rank people based on occupation, hometown, academic background and more, which became a prevalent rule of hierarchy here,\u201d said professor Kim Seok-ho of sociology from Seoul National University.\u201cInside a company, rank is the basis of what honorific title one is called by,\u201d he added.\u00a0In Korea, employees typically address one another by the person\u2019s job title, mostly following his or her last name. It even usually applies to talking with coworkers of the same rank, regardless of whether the communication is in writing or face-to-face.To break the long-standing shackles of such rigid corporate hierarchy, chaebol groups here have recently decided to eschew the use of job titles.In March, Samsung group\u2019s pharmaceutical arm Samsung BioLogics began to add \u201cpro\u201d or \u201cnim\u201d as the suffix to every employee\u2019s name to replace existing job titles like daeri (assistant manager), gwajang (manager), chajang (deputy team leader) and bujang (team leader).In the same vein, Samsung Electronics is set to reshuffle job positions by streamlining five job titles into four for higher work efficiency.A thirtysomething employee who works at a Samsung affiliate said she was \u201cconfused at first.\u201d\u201cBut since we keep the same job titles (as before) for those above team leader, dropping the use of job titles is only applied to those who sit in the lower half,\u201d she said.Time served vs. work performanceTitles convey one\u2019s position in their professional career and many Koreans regard it as another name tag. But there is a powerful signaling value in job titles, as it is also closely connected to salary. Korean companies began switching from a step-based salary system to annual salary system in the late 1990s, but the transition has yet to be fully implemented.While in theory every employee\u2019s salary fluctuates based on performance, pay is generally categorized by the years an employee has worked for the company, except in certain cases in which one has moved up the ladder or is recruited from outside.The salary compartmentalization by job title is stricter among officials working for public entities. According to relevant regulations overseen by the Personnel Management Ministry, public officials\u2019 salaries are fixed based on the salary table that is decided upon the approval of the minister at the Ministry of the Interior.For Cho, an employee who worked four years on a public company\u2019s human resources team, eradicating titles and streamlining positions is nonsense.\u201cMy company is actually adding more job titles now,\u201d he said.There are currently a total of 11 job titles in his company.\u201c(The reason we are adding more job titles) is because of the single salary table we use here. Public officials (who I work with) are gridlocked with frozen pay, without any salary negotiation or incentive. All we can get (as compensation) is a promotion or so-called \u2018job title inflation,\u2019\u201d he said. Most Korean companies are still run top-down, because promotions are based on the amount of time served rather than performance. Hence, job titles can even show approximately how long a person has been at a workplace.But it can be quite the opposite in other countries.Jillian Smith, 31, who joined a local marketing company in San Francisco in 2009, is currently a supervisor at her workplace. She is the second most senior person in her team.She was promoted last year, six years after she joined the company as an intern.\u201cTo be honest, I wanted to fully understand the work I\u2019m responsible for at my workplace. I can ask to be given a role that can expand my profession in my career,\u201d she said.According to Jill, promotions in her company are only received among those who apply.Her boss, Sarah, a senior manager on her team, was promoted a year earlier than her, though they both started at the company in the same year. But Jill said it was not something she took offense to.\u201cIf you worked hard and people recognize it, then you deserve a chance to get promoted, no matter how long you have served,\u201d she said. In Japan, where occupation and job titles are also regarded as important to social status, only those who make it through the manager\u2019s exam will get promoted. \u201cMany managers in the old Japanese company system do not work with responsibilities, since they just pass the exam to get promoted,\u201d said an anonymous blogger on an online community in Japan.\u201cOr if not, they may end up as \u2018jichou\u2019 (\u2018deputy manager\u2019 in Japanese),\u201d he added. Top-down system in Korean companiesThere have already been unsuccessful cases of dropping the use of job titles in the past. In 2012, local conglomerate Hanwha launched a campaign to standardize job titles from new graduate employees to senior managers. But within a three-year-period, the group decided to revive the use of job titles, citing confusion among employees and lack of motivation for promotion as the reason.\u201cProjects and tasks are always, and still will be, led by experienced veteran employees, normally who are a lot older than me. Getting rid of superficial titles cannot really bring a big change to current work systems,\u201d said a woman who works at the manufacturing firm\u2019s HR team.Experts agree that dropping the use of job titles is not always the right solution for companies.\u201cStrict rules and rigid work process may fuel some companies, while companies in such industries as art or entertainment will need creative opinions and freer ways of communication, without use of job titles,\u201d said Gwak Geum-ju, a professor of psychology at Seoul National University.\u201cSome -- not all -- companies may run with high efficiency when they bridge the psychological gap between workers,\u201d she added.CJ group, a local food and entertainment empire, was the first South Korean company to start eradicating the use of job titles in 2000, using \u201cnim\u201d instead of specific job titles. Calls grow for flatter organizationNow, slowly but steadily, more Koreans are eying the importance of a flatter company culture, as the need for an innovative and motivating work environment surges to replace the conventional scheme in a time of economic slump.Lee Hye-min, who spent nearly five years working at STX, a local trading service firm, said she has learned that abolishing the use of job titles can definitely reshape company culture. Earlier this year, she quit and launched her own start-up company.\u201cWhile working at STX, I was more likely to shut my mouth and hide my opinion in front of those with higher titles,\u201d said Lee.\u201cBut as you know, start-ups are not run like big companies. We cannot communicate when stuck in a hierarchical system. That\u2019s why I made my coworkers call me by my name instead of \u2018daepyonim,\u2019 or CEO.\u201dExperts also say fundamental change is sorely needed in Korea\u2019s corporate culture.\u201cMore conglomerates will focus on communication as a key factor in company culture like it is in the West. But adopting a more feasible work system so that individual workers can concentrate is more practical for Koreans for now,\u201d said Choi Seung-jun of Hyundai Research Institute.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)Interviewees that appear in the article declined to be named or did not wish to use their real names. --Ed.","648":"LONDON, (AFP) -- Five men died Thursday in an accident at a recycling centre near Birmingham, central England and a sixth man has been taken to hospital with serious leg injuries, police said.\"Police can confirm that five men have died after an industrial accident at a recycling site at Nechells this morning,\" the police statement said, referring to a suburb of the city.\"Officers were called... to reports that a wall had collapsed. Emergency services attended but the men could not be saved and they were pronounced dead at the scene,\" the statement said.Police spokesman Mark Payne said: \"We are still in the very early stages of this investigation to determine exactly what happened this morning.\"","649":"South Korea and the United States are working together to determine the extent to which North Korea uses its workers abroad to raise money for its weapons of mass destruction programs, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues said Tuesday.North Korea's exports of workers has emerged as a new area the international community needs to address to tackle both the North's human rights abuses and its defiant pursuit of missile and nuclear weapons capabilities.Speaking in an interview with Yonhap News Agency, Amb. Robert King acknowledged the difficulties of tracking the flow of money from North Korean workers to the regime in Pyongyang.\"It's very clear that North Korea uses a great deal of its resources for nuclear weapons, for missiles, for military equipment,\" he said at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. \"And to say that this dollar from this worker is going to a bomb, you don't have that kind of ability to account. It's a process that's happening and yes, we need to see what we can do to prevent it from happening.\"Unofficial estimates put the number of North Korean workers abroad at 50,000, with most of them working in labor-intensive sectors in China and Russia, but also in Mongolia and the Middle East. The North Korean regime reportedly extorts between US$200 million and $300 million from these laborers annually.As part of wide-ranging sanctions that punish Pyongyang for its recent nuclear and missile tests, U.S. President Barack Obama issued an executive order last month that among other things calls for sanctions against people who have engaged in the exportation of North Korean workers.The measure has drawn attention as it could mean that Chinese and Russian firms hiring North Korean workers could be subject to the sanctions.\"At this point, we're beginning a process, and one of the things we're doing is looking for additional information, trying to make sure we know what's happening and where the workers are, what companies they are working for,\" King said. \"We don't have a lot of information at this point. We're talking with the South Korean government and sharing information with them. We'll continue to consult with them.\"Some of the information they need is which companies are hiring the workers, what goods they're producing and whether these products are being sold in the U.S.King highlighted the increased international pressure on North Korea to improve its human rights record, especially following the 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report that revealed atrocities amounting to \"crimes against humanity.\" North Korea has been accused of holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps, torture, rape and public executions -- all of which Pyongyang rejects as a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.A key task that remains is pursuing accountability for those responsible for the crimes.\"I think that it's very clear that's where the policies of North Korea begin,\" King said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. \"So I think it's very clear that he's very responsible for many of the actions that go on. That doesn't mean he's solely responsible. He certainly sets a tone, but there are a lot of North Korean officials of one kind or another who are responsible.\"The envoy listed heads of ministries, directors of departments and soldiers guarding the borders who are often reported to fire at North Koreans trying to flee the regime.\"All of them need to understand that these are violations of fundamental human rights, and we need to make an effort to hold them accountable,\" King said. \"It's not enough to hold just the person at the top accountable. We need to hold people accountable from top to bottom.\"Last month, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a North Korea human rights resolution that centers on appointing up to two independent experts to pursue accountability for the North's human rights abuses.King arrived in Seoul Saturday and is scheduled to leave Wednesday after meetings with various senior officials at the Foreign and Unification Ministries and leaders of NGOs. (Yonhap)","650":"The U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues met with South Korean officials Tuesday to discuss ways to improve the human rights situation in the communist country.Amb. Robert King, who arrived here Saturday for a five-day trip, held closed-door meetings with senior officials handling North Korea issues at the Unification and Foreign Ministries, according to multiple sources.North Korea has come under growing pressure to improve its human rights record amid allegations of serious abuses, including holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps, torture, rape and public executions.Pyongyang, however, rejects the accusations as a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama issued an executive order calling for more stringent sanctions to punish North Korea for its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February. Among them is a sanction against people who have engaged in exporting workers from North Korea to send money to the Pyongyang regime.The issue has drawn attention as it could mean that Chinese and Russian firms hiring North Korean workers could be subject to the sanctions.\"We are exploring ways to work together on that,\" said one diplomatic source, who spoke to Yonhap News Agency on the condition of anonymity.At the Foreign Ministry, King met with Kim Yong-hyon, director-general of the Korean Peninsula peace regime bureau, to discuss the allies' and international community's recent efforts to address the North's human rights situation.In March, South Korea's National Assembly passed a North Korean human rights bill after years of delay, which among other things calls for setting up a foundation to collect information and keep archives on the North's human rights situation.Also last month, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a North Korea human rights resolution that centers on appointing up to two independent experts to verify the North's human rights violations.

Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Pyongyang for its nuclear and missile tests, but that does not mean that it's given up on dialogue.\"The United States and our partners have not given up on diplomacy. We'll keep trying to find the way forward,\" Russel said during a seminar organized by the Institute for Corean-American Studies held at the Rayburn House Office Building. \"Were North Korea to engage ..., the way forward isn't hard to visualize. It starts with the DPRK freezing all of its nuclear activities like Iran did ... and it starts with a credible declaration of its past activities and IAEA inspection of its nuclear site,\" Russel said.Such steps are basic international obligations for the North, whose fulfillment could lead to resumption of the long-stalled six-party talks, where not only denuclearization, but also all of Pyongyang's concerns can be discussed, Russel said.Earlier Monday, a spokesman at the North's powerful National Defense Commission said that the international community should no longer pursue sanctions on the regime and should focus on negotiations to find a fundamental solution to the tensions.It was believed to be the first time the North has mentioned negotiations since the January nuclear test.The six-party nuclear talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.While the talks idled, the North, which conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, conducted three more nuclear tests in 2009,2013 and in January this year. Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking the U.S.Russel reiterated that the U.S. and other countries won't accept Pyongyang as a nuclear weapons state, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's \"byeongjin\" policy of simultaneously pursuing nuclear and economic development won't succeed.But at the same time, the U.S. is ready at any time to resume credible negotiations, he said.\"The goal of sanctions is not to destroy North Korea. It's to bring North Korea's leaders to their senses,\" he said. \"The goal is to bring North Korea's leaders to the realization that at the end of the day, there is no viable alternative to authentic negotiations to the nuclear issue.\" (Yonhap)","652":"The body of a man who allegedly hanged himself was discovered only two days later on Wednesday, as the police had initially not followed up on a report made by children.

The interior ministry has asked 300 million be allocated for the project next year.The bereaved families have been voicing the need for the gene database, citing Japan's recent genetic testing for remains of people who lost their lives during the war in Okinawa, Japan.The issue of forced labor is becoming increasingly urgent as most surviving victims are well over 80 years old and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from the Japanese firms that used them.It is unclear how many people were mobilized for forced labor and died.

The average unit cost of imported masks also decreased from $0.055 in 2013 to $0.045 in 2014. YonhapImports of air purifiers increased by 21.8 percentage points to $32 million last year.Within the first five months of this year, the total amount of imported air purifiers reached $43 million, surpassing last year\u2019s $32 million. Industry watchers said that costly home appliances such as air purifiers and vacuum cleaners equipped with strong dust filters that are built to remove microorganisms were also gaining popularity. Air purifiers manufactured in Malaysia, China and Canada and vacuum cleaners manufactured in Vietnam and Denmark topped the list.The KCS did not reveal the specific brands.Imports of vacuum cleaners totaled $220 million last year, a 31.6 percent point increase from 2014. Sales of vacuum cleaners from January to May this year reached $130 million. Imports of daily supplies for oral hygiene also went up by 3.7 percentage points, reaching $16 million last year.Mobile social commerce company Ticket Monster -- one of the most-visited shopping platforms for household appliances -- said last month that the sales of products related to air purification, such as masks, air purifiers and pot plants, saw two- to fourfold on-year sales increases in May. It explained that while the sales of air purifying products mostly ceased around May last year, sales and consumer demands on those products have been constantly increasing this year even after the spring.It added that the largest group of consumers who purchased goods related to air purification last year were mostly women in their 30s (36 percent), followed by men in 30s (29 percent), men in their 40s and women in their 40s.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","662":"This year\u2019s parliamentary election is not only an battle to secure seats in the National Assembly for the upcoming four years but also a guage of public sentiment ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.Among the top three potential candidates for presidency, only two will be running in the April parliamentary race -- ruling conservative Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung in Busan and the newborn People\u2019s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in the Nowon-A constituency in northeastern Seoul.Rep.

Kim Moo-sung attends a debate in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)By successfully preventing the party from allocating candidates to run against ranking defectors such as Lee Jae-oh and Rep. Yoo Seong-min, Kim consolidated his position as the leader of the \u201cnon-Park\u201d faction.Having distanced himself from the current administration, Kim\u2019s goal is to lead the party to victory, in which case he may gain the political momentum for his presidential candidacy.Moon, on the other hand, faces a more complicated battle.His greatest plus-point as of now is that he has stayed out of the nomination dispute and the consequent negative public sentiment, which has let him keep his reputation relatively intact.According to most local pollsters in the third week of March, Moon had the highest support among potential presidential runners, maintaining a 10-week lead.But for his presidential bid to be competitive, he will need two things: incumbent leader Kim Chong-in\u2019s cooperation, and a strong Minjoo Party presence in the Assembly.The interim chief Kim, who is listed as the party\u2019s No. 2 candidate for proportional representation, has been seeking to erase the legacies of Moon\u2019s leadership, as well as that of former President Roh Moo-hyun, who belonged to the party\u2019s predecessor.People\u2019s Party co-chairman Rep.

In the 2012 elections, amid heightened public resentment against the former Lee Myung-bak government, the opposition bloc took a sweeping 61.6 percent of votes in Seoul-Gyeonggi.

The meeting comes as Pyongyang has been ratcheting up tensions with threats of attacks, claims of breakthroughs in its nuclear and missile programs, and a series of missile tests.\"In the trilateral meeting that President Obama will have with President Park and Prime Minister Abe, I think the question of North Korea will be front and center,\" Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken said during a discussion at the Brookings Institution.\"They will focus, in particular, on implementing the UN Security Council resolution, but they'll also be discussing any additional measures that we can take either individually, or collectively, or with other countries to, again, sharpen the choice for the regime in Pyongyang. So, that will be, I think, the No. 1 topic of discussion,\" he said.Blinken stressed the importance of \"real pressure\" on the North and urged Chinese cooperation.\"Unfortunately, the most effective way to achieve that, because all other ways seem to so far have failed, is to exert real pressure on North Korea and to force it to make a choice,\" he said. \"A choice between continuing these actions, or choosing a course that allows it to actually provide for its own people and develop economically.

Seoul's spy agency said that the event is expected to be held on May 7.A source familiar with North Korean affairs said the country started the process to select candidates for delegates at counties and cities for the event in mid-March.\"Given past records, a list of representatives for the party congress may come out by mid-April,\" the source said.Around 3,000 delegates are expected to join the days-long party congress to be held in Pyongyang, it said.North Korea's state media has yet to publicly comment on details over its preparation for the event. Seoul's unification ministry declined to confirm the North's move.The party congress is likely to serve as a key event that will reveal the North Korean leader's policy direction in his fifth year in power. Kim inherited power following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011.\u00a0It will mark the first party congress since October 1980, as well as the first since Kim took power.Former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il advocated a military-first, or \"songun,\" policy by operating the National Defense Commission as the main decision-making body.But the young leader has shifted his focus to the party while pursuing his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons and boosting its moribund economy in tandem, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.Seoul and Washington have warned that the North's dual-track policy is a dead end.In the past, the North made key political decisions or unveiled policies at its party congress. Also, it had major reshuffles in the party's leadership.\"North Korea may seek to carry out a shift in generations in the party's leadership at the May congress,\" said a ministry official.As the North faces tougher U.N. sanctions and unilateral punitive actions by major countries, it won't produce tangible accomplishments on the economic front, analysts said.In early March, the United Nations Security Council slapped the strongest sanctions on the North in decades over its January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February.Analysts said that the planned party congress may be held during a shorter period of time, given that there would be few countries which will send their delegates to North Korea due to its latest provocations.\"The party conference is likely to proceed for three to five days, mostly with local delegates,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.He said that the North's leader is expected to unveil his vision for governance over the next 10 years, reaffirming his dual pursuit of economic growth and nuclear weapons development.

South Korea, the fourth-largest economy in Asia, has the highest incidence rate of TB among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, partly due to the lack of epidemiological research of the disease since the Korean War (1950-53).Health Minister Chung Chin-youb speaks at a press conference Thursday. (Yonhap)\u201cWe estimate that some 400 Koreans have been infected with TB since after the Korean War,\u201d said Health Minister Chung Chin-youb at a press meeting in Seoul. \u201cAlthough state-run health centers performed epidemiological research very thoroughly after the war, things became different after we introduced our national health insurance system in 1989. When the new system took effect, many state-run health centers were replaced by private clinics that focused on treatments rather than epidemiological research on infectious diseases.\u201dThe Health Ministry aims to drop the prevalence rate of the disease to 12 patients per 100,000 people, which is the OECD average. In 2014, South Korea marked a TB incidence rate of 86 patients per 100,000, seven times higher than the average rate of the developed nations.The newly introduced measure requires all Koreans to get tested for latent TB -- a condition in which the TB bacteria is in the body but inactive and causing no symptoms -- at least twice in their lives. The first test should be taken at age 15, with the second at 40. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB some time in their lives.Participants to a special event promoting prevention of tuberculosis perform a special dance asking the public to cover their coughs to prevent the spread of the infectious disease in central Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)\u201cWith proper treatment, latent TB patients can avoid developing TB by up to 90 percent,\u201d said Minister Chung. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no developed nation currently requires all citizens to be tested for latent TB. However, Japan and the U.S. made it mandatory for young children to be tested for the disease from 1965-2002, and 1960-1990, respectively. \u201cJapan also struggled with TB after World War II,\u201d Kwon Joon-wook, who heads the Health Ministry\u2019s bureau of public health policy, told The Korea Herald. \u201cThe number of newly diagnosed latent TB patients decreased significantly throughout 1965-2002, after requiring all children to get tested twice, at age 7 and 13.\u201dSouth Korea has recently seen a number of TB cases occurring at facilities with a large number of people, such as schools and postpartum centers. Last year, TB cases were reported in 974 schools, 332 military bases and 91 day care centers and postpartum care facilities. While the number of newly diagnosed TB patients here last year was the lowest in 15 years, new TB patients between 10 and 14 years old increased over the same period. \u201cSouth Korea is cornered by countries where the incidence of drug-resistant isolates is the highest in the world: India, China, Russia and North Korea,\u201d said Dr. Vincent Delorme from the Seoul-based Institut Pasteur Korea. \u201cWith the increase in tourism and ease of travel, combined with the fact that TB is an extremely contagious disease, it is not surprising to see more and more drug-resistant strains circulating in Korea.\u201d The medical researcher also said there is a lack of genomic information regarding TB isolates circulating in South Korea, which makes the epidemiologic studies incomplete.At the same time, Delorme said bacilli has become resistant to more than 10 available TB drugs in South Korea.\u00a0 This means that only drugs that have been introduced in recent years are now effective, he added.

Since then, the patient has taken a dozen red ginseng capsules daily and has not used any other medication, according to a team led by Cho Young-gul, a professor at the University of Ulsan's Asan Medical Center.Each capsule contains 500mg of the root that was steamed for three hours and left to dry at 50-80 C, with no additives, according to the team.It said the South Korean patient has shown no symptoms of AIDS for 31 years, noting the person insists the infection actually occurred in 1985.This latest research has drawn attention, as few cases of HIV patients on medication surviving for more than 30 years have been reported worldwide.Cho said that the patient's immunity recently dropped remarkably, as the person started failing to take red ginseng regularly for personal reasons.Usually, the duration of life without treatment for HIV-infected persons is 11 years.Previously, a case of an Australian staying alive for 29 years without taking AIDS medication was reported.Cho said Korean red ginseng seems to cause defects in the genetic code related to the AIDS virus, thus curbing the progression of the disease.Such a hongsam treatment \"might induce genetic defects in the negative factor gene,\" which is associated with the human immunodeficiency virus, he said in a report published in the Journal of Ginseng Research.A number of studies have shown that the long-term intake of Korean red ginseng helps promote the human immune system.

In an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that despite historical and language differences, the two countries have \"many things in common,\" which would help further cement their long-standing amicable ties.\"The two nations established their diplomatic relations 130 years ago and have forged a strategic partnership based upon which they have bolstered their exchanges and trade volume,\" the minister said. \"I believe the bilateral relationship is at its peak.\"Ayrault arrived here on Wednesday for a three-day visit. It is his first trip to an Asian country since he was inaugurated last month as the French minister of foreign affairs and international development.His schedule here was arranged as part of the two countries' efforts to mark the 130th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic ties, which falls on June 4 this year.Having designated the period from the latter part of 2015 to the end of 2016 as the \"2015-2016 Korea-France Year,\" the two countries have been celebrating the anniversary with some 350 events in various areas including culture, education, science-technology, economy and industry.Ayrault portrayed the celebratory events taking place in both nations as \"forward-looking,\" taking note of Seoul's \"strong\" resolve to develop the bilateral relationship.\"The South Korean government with a strong resolve has been striving to develop the bilateral relationship as shown in its push for the series of the events (to mark the 130th anniversary of the relations),\" he said.\"I hope that bilateral exchanges in the economy, culture and science-technology will further be strengthened. To this end, I have come here to Korea.\"The minister also said that he would like to capitalize on his trip to Korea to introduce France's culture, tradition and cuisines to Koreans, and to underscore that France has made many achievements in terms of technological innovation.As for the areas of future cooperation, the French minister pointed to language education, which would help students of the two nations better understand one another and deepen their friendship.On Thursday, Ayrault will hold the first \"strategic dialogue\" with his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues including North Korea's nuclear problem. The meeting is in line with an agreement reached at last year's summit that aims to strengthen the two countries' comprehensive partnership. Last year, two-way trade reached $8.7 billion with South Korea exporting $2.6 billion worth of ships, cars, cellular phones and other products to France and importing $6.1 billion worth of aircraft, cosmetics, medicine and other items.

The accident happened in the Chinese border city of Dandong on Feb. 10 when a car being driven by the unnamed North Korean consular official \"collided with a taxi, killing the taxi driver and a passenger,\" China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. Hua said the North Korean diplomat paid compensation, without specifying the amount. \"Local authorities have dealt with the incident in accordance with the law,\" Hua said. A source in Dandong told Yonhap News Agency on Tuesday that the accident involving the North Korean diplomat took place on Feb. 7 and three Chinese citizens were killed. The North Korean diplomat paid a total of 1.5 million yuan ($230,714) in damages to the families of three Chinese victims who he killed in a drunk driving accident, according to the source.","676":"South Korea on Wednesday announced its plan to dispatch a total of 300 teachers and university students overseas this year to share the experience of Korea's educational development.The education ministry and the National Institute for International Education (NIIED) said that 140 teachers and 160 students attending teachers' universities will be sent to 15 foreign countries for a project to engage in various educational programs, including teaching foreign students. The number of participants for this year will be the largest since the program was initiated in 2013, the ministry said. Previously, only 20 participants went overseas annually to help developing countries in their education programs as a project for Official Development Assistance (ODA) through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).Under the ODA project so far, South Korea has sent teachers to eight countries, mostly those that are developing such as Ethiopia and Swaziland. But this year, South Korea will dispatch some to non-ODA countries, according to the NIIED.As a long-term stay program, some 140 teachers will lecture at regular schools on such subjects as Korean language, mathematics, science and computers. However, 10 positions were open to retired teachers, university professors and educational administrators with more than 10 years of experience. They will be assigned to serve as advisers for the host countries' education-related divisions.During their one-year stay starting in August, the teachers going to the ODA countries will receive a monthly payment of 2.5 million won (US$2,150) in addition to monthly living expenses of 1 million won plus air fare.Those going to non-ODA countries will be paid a similar salary by the host countries with living expenses and air fare covered as well.The 160 university students will serve as teachers for roughly one month during their vacation period.The students to be dispatched overseas will have air fare and living expenses covered if they file education program proposals to NIIED.Long-term applications will be accepted until April 22 while short-term applications will be accepted by April 29. The results of the open selection will be announced in May on the NIIED homepage (niied.go.kr).

They are areas within a radius of 300 meters of elementary schools or day care centers, according to road traffic laws.YonhapThe city vowed to install 151 more surveillance cameras by the end of this year, to achieve an installation rate of 100 percent in Seoul\u2019s school zones. This includes 74 cameras that will be additionally installed in areas where extra attention is required, following residents\u2019 requests. In response to some residents who said that installing surveillance cameras invades their privacy, the city has decided to inform residents a month prior to installation, as well as to hold monthly public hearings.\u201cWe are going to continue working on ensuring safety in school zones, and also build more speed bumps and anti-slip mats to prevent car accidents in the area,\u201d said an official from the city\u2019s pedestrian and bicycle division.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","678":"The co-leaders of the integrated national sports body said Wednesday that the merger of two sports bodies will further enhance the country's effort to develop sports.Kim Jung-haeng, president of the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC), and Kang Young-joong, head of the Korea Council of Sport for All (KOCOSA), were inaugurated as co-presidents of the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee (KSOC) and began their work on Wednesday after a ceremony in Seoul.The KSOC was officially founded on Monday after the legal paperwork was approved. Under domestic law, the KOC, which oversees the country's sports in general and elite athletes for competitive events, and the KOCOSA, which aims to promote daily sports and a healthy lifestyle for every South Korean, had to complete their merger by Sunday.Kim and Kang will serve as co-presidents of the integrated body until late October, when the election for the new KSOC president will take place.The co-presidents emphasized in their inauguration ceremony that the merger will spark the country's effort to have an advanced management system and environment in sports.\"The merger on Monday signaled a new start of South Korea's sports,\" said Kim. \"We have recovered the status and function of a sports body that can oversee all sports areas of the country.\"Kang also acknowledged that the merger between the 96-year-old KOC and the KOCOSA, which was founded in 1991, will open a new era in the country's sports, with South Korea at a critical turning point. \"In order to improve competitiveness in each sport and support the healthy lives of South Koreans, connecting elite sports and daily sports is essential and it is a tide of our times,\" Kang said.However, both leaders said they are still tuning up minor details in the newly integrated body. Personnel appointments and re-shuffles already took place on Saturday, and employees from the two bodies have been working together in the same office this week.\"There are lot of talks (about our operation), but what's important is that the two sports bodies agreed with each other and made a working system,\" Kim said. \"I will take care of what's related to the Olympics, and other projects will be processed after having discussions.\" (Yonhap)","679":"President Park Geun-hye has received an invitation by U.N.

The North has long denounced them as a rehearsal for a northward invasion, a charge denied by Seoul and Washington.The North ratchets up its bellicose rhetoric whenever Seoul and Washington hold the military exercises.South Korea vehemently condemned the North for warning of attacks on Park, calling for an immediate end to such \"vulgar\" acts.\"We will never condone the North's threats against President Park and our people,\" Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman at the Unification Ministry, told a regular press briefing. \"North Korea should immediately end its vulgar and despicable acts.\"He added that South Korea's military will \"sternly and relentlessly\" respond to any additional provocation by the North.The North has made numerous threats following the United Nations Security Council's latest sanctions over Pyongyang's January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February.North Korea last week launched two medium-range ballistic missiles, with one believed to have blown up in mid-flight. It also fired several short-range projectiles this month into waters off its east coast.The North also said it plans to conduct nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles tests \"in a short time,\" raising speculation over its additional provocations.Experts say that Pyongyang may see somewhere between the end of the military drills and its party event slated for early May as a prime time for high-profile provocations, including sporadic military actions.South Korea's spy agency said that the North is likely to hold its ruling party congress on May 7, the first in more than three decades.\"The North appears to aim to show its strong protest against the Seoul-Washington drills and raise tension for higher internal solidarity,\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. (Yonhap)","681":"North Korea conducted a ground test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile last week, a U.S. news report said Tuesday, a move that, if confirmed, would add to a series of provocative acts Pyongyang has undertaken in defiance of international pressure.The March 16 test involved a \"pop-up\" or \"ejection test\" of the KN-11 missile from a canister ashore at the Sinpo shipyard on the North's east coast, where the missile is being developed along with the Gorae-class missile-firing submarine, the Washington Free Beacon reported, citing unidentified officials.Cmdr. Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to comment on the report, citing intelligence matters.State Department spokesman John Kirby also said he's seen the report, but cannot confirm its veracity.It was the latest in a series of SLBM tests the North has conducted since May, when Pyongyang claimed it successfully carried out an SLBM test underwater. The regime has since carried out SLBM ejection tests on Nov. 28 and Dec. 21, but they were unsuccessful, according to officials.The latest test is the first since the U.N. Security Council adopted a new sanctions resolution in response to Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test in January and its long-range rocket launch in February. Like previous resolutions, the resolution also bans Pyongyang from all ballistic missile activity.The North's SLBM capability, if fully developed, would pose a serious threat because of its mobile nature. But experts say that an \"ejection\" test is usually conducted in an early stage of developing SLBM capabilities, and Pyongyang is believed to be still many years away from developing an SLBM.In recent weeks, the North has carried out a series of missile launches in defiance of the U.N. resolution and in a gesture of displeasure over annual joint military exercises between the South and the U.S., which Pyongyang has long branded as a rehearsal for invasion.Last week, the North also fired two medium-range Rodong missiles, prompting the U.N. Security Council to hold an emergency meeting and issue a statement condemning the firings as a violation of Security Council resolutions.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has also threatened to conduct yet another nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches. South Korea said the communist nation is believed to be ready to carry out another nuclear test at any time.Asked for comment on the possibility of a nuclear test, Kirby said the U.S. is \"mindful of the regime's desire to pursue tests like this,\" but declined to speak to intelligence matters. He added that such a test would be a violation of U.N. resolutions.\"If you're asking me if they were to conduct another test, would it be a violation? Absolutely it would be.

It is the nation\u2019s first confirmed case of the mosquito-borne virus, which is suspected of causing serious birth defects. According to the authorities, the 43-year-old man returned to Korea via Frankfurt Airport in Germany on March 11. He visited the South American country for work purposes from Feb. 17-March 9. He began to experience symptoms, including fever and muscle pain, on March 16. He visited a small clinic Friday in Gwangyang, South Jeolla Province. Although he told his doctor that he\u2019d been to Brazil and had two typical symptoms of the disease -- fever and muscle pain -- the physician didn\u2019t report the case to authorities immediately. This was against the manual that had been distributed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which asked doctors nationwide to report any patient having visited a Zika-affected country and having any of the following symptoms: fever, muscle pain, headache or conjunctivitis. He visited the same clinic again Monday after developing skin rashes, although his fever had gone down. His doctor finally reported the patient to the government after observing his rashes.\u00a0 KCDC director Jung Ki-suk speaks at a press conference in Sejong City, Tuesday. (Yonhap)\u201cWe are going to talk to the particular physician about the matter,\u201d said Jung Ki-suk, director of the KCDC. \u201cWe plan to ask him why he failed to report the case after the patient made his first visit. No changes have been made to the initial manual (for health care workers) and it will stay the same.\u201dThe patient is currently in stable condition and not experiencing any symptoms, according to the agency. He is staying at the Chonnam National University Hospital in Gwangju only to be monitored and for research purposes. He does not need to be isolated while staying at the hospital, Jung added. \u201cHe is well enough to be released from the hospital,\u201d the director of the KCDC said. \u201cBut we thought it was necessary to monitor him for a while since he is the first Korean Zika patient. We would like to find out if Koreans have any unique responses to the particular virus.\u201dThe World Health Organization on February issued a worldwide warning that the Zika virus is a global public health emergency that requires a united response. The agency claimed the infection has been linked to cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. Zika can be also spread by a man to his sexual partners. It\u2019s currently unknown if a woman can spread the virus through sex. Upon confirming the first case of Zika, the KCDC strongly advised that pregnant women and those considering becoming pregnant consider postponing travel to countries where Zika is circulating, including Mexico, Thailand and Brazil. Jung also urged all women nationwide to delay pregnancy for at least two months after returning to Korea from Zika-affected countries. For Korean male travelers who visited the nations, he advised them to use condoms for at least 30 days after returning home. The KCDC is also banning those who visited the affected nations -- the list can be found at the KCDC website at www.cdc.go.kr -- from donating blood for at least a month after their return to Korea.Jung also explained the KCDC was developing a data system that tracks all travelers coming from Zika-affected nations who had stopovers in other countries prior to arriving in Korea. \u201cUntil we establish the system, we ask all travelers coming from Zika affected countries to report to the authorities at the airport if they had a stopover in non-affected nations,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you do that, you\u2019ll receive text messages from us letting you know what to do if you experience Zika-like symptoms.\u201dThe agency also intends to medically examine the first patient\u2019s spouse for possible infection, pending her consent.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","686":"The Marine Corps has formed a new mobile unit tasked with attacking North Korea from the rear in the event of a contingency, a military official said Sunday.The regimental-level unit of 3,000 troops was launched in the southeastern coastal city of Pohang on March 1, dubbed \"Spartan 3000,\" the official said.The troops will be on standby for deployment to all parts of the Korean Peninsula within 24 hours, tasked with destroying key military facilities in the North's rear during contingencies.

(Yonhap)","688":"North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the East Sea on Friday, Seoul\u2019s military officials said, marking another round of provocations amid the ongoing South Korea-U.S. military drills and their accelerating sanctions push. One medium-range missile, presumed to be a Rodong, took off at around 5:55 a.m. from the western county of Sukchon and flew some 800 kilometers before hitting the waters within Japan\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone, the Joint Chiefs of Staff here said. But another one fired 22 minutes later from the same area vanished from radar after cruising about 17 kilometers. Yonhap\u201cOur analysis so far indicates that (the second one) was also a missile launch, but further analysis is needed to rule out if it was a mock-up,\u201d the JCS said in a statement.

Security Council resolutions banning any use by Pyongyang of ballistic technology. \u201cToday\u2019s firing is a grave provocation threatening peace on the peninsula and around the world in disregard of the international community\u2019s collective will reflected in Resolution 2270,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, referring to the text adopted in response to the North\u2019s Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch. The U.S. State and Defense Departments also issued criticism, saying they were aware of and closely monitoring the situation. \u201cLaunches using ballistic missile technology are a clear violation of multiple UNSC resolutions,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Bill Urban said in a statement. \u201cWe call on North Korea to refrain from actions that further raise tensions in the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments and obligations.\u201d The communist state has been ratcheting up tensions since the latest international resolution was passed and Seoul and Washington kicked off their annual joint exercises on the largest scale ever early this month.

On March 10, it also fired two short-range Scud missiles into the East Sea. The latest provocation represents the North\u2019s first use of medium-range missiles in nearly two years. With a maximum range of 1,300 kilometers, the Rodong is capable of carrying warheads and reaching all of the South and part of Japan.\u201cThe series of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile launches appears to be linked with Kim Jong-un\u2019s recent instruction,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told reporters, citing state media reports early this week. \u201cOur military sees that the North is quickening preparations for test-firings to boost its nuclear capabilities under Kim\u2019s directive.\u201d By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","689":"WASHINGTON (Yonhap) -- The White House urged North Korea on Wednesday to release a detained U.S. college student after Pyongyang\u2019s highest court sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly stealing a political propaganda sign.White House press secretary Josh Earnest issued the appeal, accusing the North of using detained Americans as \u201cpawns to pursue a political agenda.\u201d The verdict came as Pyongyang has been ramping up bellicose threats against the U.S. and South Korea.

This concern is causing the military to keep close tabs on North Korean activities, the source said.A South Korean man was killed in July 2010 when a wooden-boxed land mine he found in the Imjin River exploded. The river roughly flows along the boundary of the two Koreas. Land mines have also been found in the estuary region of the Han River and as far away as Gyodong Island between the two Koreas.North Korea is believed to have significantly increased the number of land mines it has planted in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that bisects the Korean Peninsula this year, other South Korean officials said. In August last year two South Korean soldiers were seriously injured by a land mine explosion at the DMZ that Seoul claim was planted by North Korea. Since April, the North has placed more than 4,000 new land mines in the DMZ, and 70 to 80 percent of them are believed to be wooden-box land mines which are hard to detect using conventional mine detecting gear, according to the officials.Millions of land mines have been buried on the divided peninsula during the 1950-53 Korean War and afterwards, particularly in the DMZ.The two Koreas still remain technically at war since the three-year war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

In 2009, South Korea enacted a law that grants citizens in foreign countries the right to cast ballots both for parliamentary elections and the presidential vote in their homeland.The NEC official said that the registration numbers were higher than the previous parliamentary election in 2012 thanks to the number of increased polling stations and easier registration process.Unlike in previous elections, applications were accepted not only in person, but also by mail, email and over the Internet, the NEC said. In previous elections, voters had to visit diplomatic missions to register their intention to vote.Voting for overseas Koreans is scheduled to kick off on March 30 for a six-day run at 198 polling stations. (Yonhap)","693":"Several political heavyweights announced Wednesday that they could run in next month's parliamentary election by either becoming independents or joining other parties amid a growing feud over the nomination process.Earlier this week, the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea almost wrapped up the selection of candidates who will run in the April 13 general elections.On Tuesday, the Saenuri's election nomination committee announced the candidates that will receive party tickets, but excluded several high-profile politicians such as Yim Tae-hee, a former two-term lawmaker.Yim, who also served as the chief of staff to former President Lee Myung-bak, said he will win as an independent, as he could not accept the party's decision to exclude him from consideration.Rep. Lee Jae-oh, a five-term lawmaker and considered to be an opponent of the pro-Park Geun-hye faction within the party, also failed to receive the party ticket.Rep. Lee previously served as the party's floor leader and is considered one of the closest confidants of former President Lee.The ruling party still has not finalized whether to nominate the party's former floor leader Yoo Seong-min.Yoo stepped down from his post in July 2015 after President Park publicly lambasted him for leading negotiations with the main opposition party on the passage of a parliamentary revision bill.Political analysts forecast that if Lee Jae-oh creates some kind of coalition with other heavyweight dropouts, this could pose problems for the ruling camp, particularly in heavily contested districts in Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi region.Meanwhile, Rep. Chyung Ho-joon, who had failed to receive the Minjoo Party's ticket, joined the minor People's Party on Wednesday.Chyung's move allows the People's Party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc by having 20 seats in the 300-strong National Assembly. The Minjoo Party of Korea excluded Chyung and other veteran politicians, including former Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan, who also declared his intent to run as an independent.Chyung is a son of Chyung Da-chul, a former adviser to the Minjoo Party. The senior Chyung had said he would persuade his son to join the minor People's Party and would join it as well.Rep. Jung Chung-rai, who was also excluded from the nomination last week, meanwhile, said he will respect the party nomination committee's decision.\"I am willing to do anything for the party's victory,\" Jung told reporters, noting that he will not take further action.Rival parties have virtually picked most of the candidates who will run for the 253 parliamentary seats to be chosen through direct elections. The remaining 47 are proportional representation seats that will be allocated to parties according to the numbers of votes they receive overall. (Yonhap)","694":"An interim chief of South Korea's main opposition party said Wednesday that Seoul should cooperate with the international community to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.Kim Chong-in, head of the Minjoo Party of Korea, made the call, saying there is no other choice than to join hands with the rest of the world to enforce the U.N. Security Council Resolution.\"Not only South Korea but the entire world is pressuring (North Korea),\" Kim said during a forum hosted by the Kwanhun Club, an association of senior journalists. The resolution, adopted earlier this month to punish North Korea for its recent nuclear and missile tests, calls for the mandatory inspection of all cargo going into and out of the North and a ban on the country's exports of coal and other mineral resources, among other things.Kim, however, said that the government should consider various dialogue formats since the shutdown of a joint industrial park means that the only channel for inter-Korean cooperation has been cut off.On Feb. 10, Seoul shut down the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the North's border city of the same name in the wake of heightened cross-border tensions. (Yonhap)","695":"When former Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan returned from the Cabinet back to the legislature earlier this year, expectations had been high from within the ruling Saenuri Party that he would actively play a bridging role between the party and the presidential office.But following the party\u2019s crushing defeat in the April 13 general election and the consequent blame game among rivaling factions, Choi now finds that his strength -- being one of the few confidants of President Park Geun-hye -- has boomeranged on him, deterring him from seeking party leadership.\u201cI will not run in the (party\u2019s) national convention (to elect new leadership), but serve as a rank-and-file lawmaker, hoping that the Park administration and the Saenuri Party may gain back public trust,\u201d Choi said Wednesday in a press conference.Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan speaks during a press conference at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Park Hae-mook\/The Korea HeraldHis announcement came just hours before the party\u2019s general meeting during which the interim leadership was set to discuss the blueprint for the national convention slated for Aug. 9.Choi\u2019s words were confirmation of rampant speculations that his challenge to the party\u2019s chairmanship at this point in time will have more cons than pros.Those in his faction loyal to the president reportedly had urged him to remain at the center stage so as to offer upmost support to Park, who is currently in the fourth year of her five-year term. But he has also faced pressure for the result of the April race in which the party lost a considerable number of seats, several of them in stronghold constituencies.Though he was not directly involved in the election strategy including candidate nominations and campaigning, the former finance minister was dubbed the \u201cidentifier of the true pro-Park\u201d during the election season by selectively rallying for those considered to be firmly on President Park\u2019s side.Choi, for instance, participated in the office opening ceremony of then-candidate Kim Jin-tae at Chuncheon, but was nowhere to be seen when non-Park candidates held their campaigns in Daegu. The southeastern conservative stronghold city is also where Choi holds his representative seat.His discriminative stumping triggered complaints from those outside the mainstream, who considered themselves to be at a disadvantage. But the tables turned after many of the pro-Park candidates lost in the race and the defeat was largely blamed on their dogmatic operation. Choi and his faction lost face and the upper hand, giving way to the rise of new reformist members, such as floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.\u201cI was so often accused of manipulating the nominations that some even advised me to regain honor by running for party chairmanship,\u201d Choi claimed.\u201cBut with only the people\u2019s livelihoods and national development in my heart, I will once again sacrifice myself.\u201dHe then alluded to his support for Rep. Suh Chung-won, the eighth-termer the majority of the pro-Park faction is seeking to recommend as chairman candidate.Choi\u2019s decision to take a back seat for the time being coincides with the burgeoning controversy surrounding another key pro-Park member, Rep. Lee Jung-hyun. The third-term lawmaker and former senior presidential secretary for public affairs is accused of attempting to censor news coverage critical of the government on the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking tragedy. Despite escalating attacks from the opposition against Lee that they cite as a representative example of oppressive incumbent government against freedom of expression, Lee is set to announce his bid for the chairmanship Thursday.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","696":"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday that \"diplomatic means\" can maintain regional stability, with tensions in Northeast Asia spiking over North Korea's nuclear test and rocket launch.\"It is up to regional countries to maintain stability and harmony,\" Li said in response to a question about North Korea's provocations and regional security issues. Li, speaking at a press conference at the end of the country's rubber-stamp parliament session, did not mention North Korea by name, but stressed that China needs a stable regional environment for its development. Li said, \"Some differences may arise between neighbors, but we believe that, as long as we treat each other with sincerity and seek peaceful settlement to differences with diplomatic means, regional stability will be maintained.\" North Korea, the only treaty ally of China, has been slapped with new U.N. sanctions for its fourth nuclear test and rocket launch earlier this year. In an escalation of warlike rhetoric, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered his country to soon conduct a nuclear warhead test and test-launch ballistic missiles. Such a nuclear threat is unusual, even though North Korea has periodically ramped up threatening language against the ongoing joint military drills between South Korea and the United States. \"As for countries from outside of the region, like the United States, we think the United States will never leave the Asia-Pacific region and all countries can work together to enhance cooperation and properly handle differences,\" Li said.While supporting the new U.N. sanctions, China has proposed to pursue peace treaty talks with North Korea in tandem with denuclearization negotiations. Signing a peace treaty, which would replace the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War, has been one of North Korea's long-running goals, but South Korea and the U.S. have demanded the North abandon its nuclear program first. (Yonhap)","697":"North Korea may conduct another nuclear test or launch a long-range rocket ahead of its key party congress in May to maximize the impact of its provocations, experts said Wednesday.North Korea said Tuesday it plans to carry out nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles tests \"in a short time\" in an apparent show of its defiance against tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions.The North's threats have raised the possibility that Pyongyang may make more nuclear and missile provocations this year following its Jan. 6 nuclear test and long-range rocket launch on Feb. 7.\"Given its track record, North Korea is likely to make additional provocations to show that its nuclear capacity is not overblown and to strengthen internal solidarity,\" said Chung Sung-yoon, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification.The North usually ups the ante ahead of prominent political events or key anniversaries to maximize the impact of its belligerent acts and elicit allegiance from the general public.One of the two upcoming key events for the North is the \"Day of the Sun,\" which falls on April 15, the birthday of late founder Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong-un.The ruling Workers' Party of Korea, meanwhile, plans to hold its first party congress in more than three decades in May. Seoul's spy agency said the party event is expected to be held on May 7.\"The North is likely to make provocations between late April and early May,\" Chung said, adding that it is more likely to conduct the fifth nuke test.Others like Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that the North may launch an intermediate-range missile right before the party congress, rather than choose another nuclear test.\"It won't be easy for the North to carry out another nuke test as I think that Pyongyang would want to reserve it as a bargaining chip for possible talks with a new U.S. government,\" Yang said.But experts also said that if the North does not make high-profile provocations before the party event, it may try to utilize its nuclear weapons as a card for dialogue.The North detonated three nuclear devices in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and followed with a fourth test in January.

Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam Szubin is on a visit to China for such discussions, he said.He also said China's support of the tough sanctions is a \"very significant development.\"\"I was in China the week after the U.N. Security Council at the G-20 meetings, and I had conversations at the highest levels in China, and I can tell you that they don't view this as something they're doing for us,\" the secretary told the hearing. \"They look across their border and it makes them very nervous that they can't explain some of the actions that are reckless and that are destabilizing,\" he said. \"They have certainly indicated a high level of concern ... That's why they supported the resolution. They've indicated an intention to implement it.\"Implementing the sanctions takes sustained efforts, he said.\"We know from these sanctions programs that it's grueling day-to-day work. You've got to identify the entities, act against the entities,\" he said. \"I think it is a very significant statement to North Korea that China is part of this international effort.\"The new U.N. sanctions, the toughest ever to be imposed on Pyongyang, require mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North and ban its exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a key source of hard currency that accounts for nearly half of the country's total exports.It also prohibits all small arms and other conventional weapons from being sold to the North, bans jet and rocket fuel supplies to the country, grounds North Korean flights suspected of carrying contraband and denies vessels carrying illicit items access to ports.The Treasury Department is in the final stage of putting together a package of unilateral sanctions against the North to carry out the Security Council sanctions and the recent congressional legislation tightening the screws on Pyongyang. (Yonhap)","699":"Unlike previous sanctions, implementation of the new U.N. sanctions on North Korea appear to be going pretty well, with China actively carrying out both financial and trade restrictions, an American sanctions expert said Tuesday. Joshua Stanton, a North Korea sanctions expert who helped write the North Korea sanctions legislation that passed Congress last month, made the assessment during a Heritage Foundation discussion, saying he was \"encouraged\" to see positive effects of the sanctions.\"What we've seen so far is that the large banks in China have begun cutting off money transfers to North Korea,\" he said. \"Shipping sanctions seem to be working pretty well. We've seen that the Philippines seized a North Korean ship that was among the 31 ships designated by the U.N. Security Council.\"China has also been turning away North Korean ships, and the North's coal exports have also been halted, he said. What's also important to note is that the sanctions have had little effect on the everyday lives of North Korean people, with food prices remaining stable, he said. On the contrary, more food and coal have been put into markets in the North as their exports have been made difficult, he said.\"The early signs are encouraging. It is too early again to say that the policy is working, but these are exactly the signs I would expect to see if the policy will work,\" Stanton said.But he warned against hasty optimism, saying there is \"too much that could go wrong.\"\"The most obvious danger is that China sort of feints toward cooperating with the sanctions for a few months and then everything blows over and we take our eyes off the ball and suddenly we wake up one morning and the Bank of China is doing money transfers to the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea again,\" he said.The past sanctions resolutions on the North have not been carried out as there have been too many exceptions to their enforcement, Stanton said, claiming that the now-shuttered inter-Korean industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong was also a clear violation of sanctions.The factory park had been kept intact as a last-remaining symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement, but South decided to shut the complex, which served as a key source of hard currency for Pyongyang, in response to the North's nuclear and missile tests.Stanton stressed that in order to maintain the momentum for sanctions implementation, it is important for the U.S. government to show determination to enforce the sanctions legislation that was enacted with overwhelming support from Congress.Right after the passage of the U.N. sanctions, the U.S. government announced unilateral sanctions, blacklisting the North's powerful National Defense Commission as well as key aides to leader Kim Jong-un, such as Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of the Korean People's Army.\"I'm looking for more designations, including the designation of 'His Corpulancy' himself, which is something that the State Department and the president must consider under Section 302 of the new sanctions law,\" the expert said, referring to the North's leader.Officials have said that the U.S. Treasury Department is putting together an additional package of sanctions on the North to carry out the U.N. resolution and to enforce the sanctions legislation.

Lee, sixth-termer and incumbent representative of Sejong City, announcing his independent candidacy.\u201cThe Kim Chong-in leadership has vaguely cited political reasons, but this is not a proper approach to politics,\u201d he said. Lee has been considered an iconic leader of those who were close to the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun. Lee Hae-chan (Yonhap)Lee\u2019s defection further escalated the widening feud at the Minjoo Party, reeling from the aftermath of what critics called a brutal elimination of some of the party\u2019s odds-on players by interim leader Kim.They accuse Kim of acting out of his commitment to exclude the old guard and to expand his leverage over centrist groups, thereby reducing the party\u2019s election chances.The party leadership contended that the decision on Lee was inevitable.\u201c(Lee\u2019s exclusion from nomination) is a political decision, in due consideration of the overall electoral context,\u201d said Minjoo Party spokesperson Kim Sung-soo.\u201cWe expect that Rep. Lee will understand that this is inevitable for the sake of victory.\u201dLee has been considered a strong asset for the party since he agreed to a party request to run in the new administrative city in 2012 and won comfortably, with 46.8 percent of the votes.His weak point, however, is that he represents the pro-Roh clique, which party chief Kim pegged as responsible for the party\u2019s constant power feuds.The leadership\u2019s explanatory tone hinted that Lee had been ruled out due to his symbolic affiliation to the former administration, not because of his legislative performance or chances of electoral success.The interim leadership\u2019s unsparing decision to cut him off had also been applied to Rep. Jung Cheong-rae, a Seoul second-termer who had won public recognition for his hardball speeches during the record-long filibuster last month.Rep. Jung not only belonged to the pro-Roh faction but also spoke for the party\u2019s extremists, another group which Kim had pledged to reduce.A number of opposition supporters vowed to boycott the party unless Jung was accepted, but the leadership remained unperturbed, rejecting the lawmaker\u2019s request for a reexamination.The exclusion of two symbolic pro-Roh figures also indicated that the Kim leadership intends to erase the vestiges of former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.Moon resigned from the party leadership earlier this year, voluntarily yielding all power to Kim, amid growing criticism that the pro-Roh clique was monopolizing power.The nomination committee\u2019s stance was reaffirmed late on Monday, when it denied candidacy to a young designer who had joined the party late last year upon Moon\u2019s invitation.\u201cMy (candidate qualification) interview, which ended in less than five minutes and only consisted of insignificant questions, was quickly followed by a rejection notice,\u201d said Kim Been.Those who won the qualification were mostly conventional party members, including a former spokesperson of the party\u2019s Seoul regional headquarters.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","701":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened Tuesday to carry out a fresh round of nuclear and long-range rocket tests \u201cin a short time,\u201d claiming the country has secured missile reentry technology and uncovering an image of what it said is a warhead part.\u00a0Seoul and Washington urged Pyongyang to cease provocative actions and rhetoric, and abide by its international obligations.\u00a0\u201cWe will conduct an explosion experiment of a nuclear warhead and test-fire a ballistic rocket capable of carrying the warhead in a short time in order to boost the reliance of our nuclear strike capabilities,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying by the official Korean Central News Agency, while overseeing a mock reentry test of a warhead tip.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve made great progress in our ballistic rocket technologies by securing the atmospheric reentry technology in our own strength, which is only possessed by a few countries that consider themselves to be a military power.\u201d North Korean leader Kim Jong-un watches a simulation test of a ballistic rocket launch during an inspection tour in this combined image released by North Korean daily newspaper the Rodong Sinmun on Tuesday. YonhapHis remarks marked the latest in an ongoing string of nuclear threats the communist state has churned out against South Korea and the U.S. since the U.N. Security Council adopted a new resolution over its recent atomic and rocket experiments.\u00a0With the allies carrying out their annual joint military drills on their largest-ever scale, the tone of North Korea\u2019s state media appears to be growing more rigorous and substantive. It unveiled for the first time a photo of what it claimed was a miniaturized warhead.\u00a0The KCNA reported last Friday that Kim had instructed his aides to ready additional rounds of atomic tests and continue diversifying the means to load nuclear warheads, while inspecting a short-range ballistic missile launch a day earlier.\u00a0Kim\u2019s mention of the timing, in particular, bolstered speculation that Pyongyang may push ahead with another major provocation ahead of the ruling Worker\u2019s Party congress slated for May.\u00a0President Park Geun-hye issued stringent criticism, calling the ongoing threats \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d\u00a0\u201cNorth Korea could wind up walking the self-paved path of self-destruction if it continues to intensely confront the international community and does not change course,\u201d she said during a Cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae. The Foreign Ministry echoed her view, saying Kim\u2019s remarks were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and warning of consequences should the regime commit an additional provocation.The Defense Ministry here also dismissed the young ruler\u2019s latest assertion as a \u201cunilateral argument,\u201d saying the North has yet to master the convoluted reentry technology, citing \u201cvarious sources of intelligence available.\u201d\u00a0Washington, for its part, warned the regime against tension-escalating moves.\u00a0\u201cWe urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions and rhetoric that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments,\u201d said State Department spokesperson Anna Richey-Allen.\u00a0U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday that effective enforcement of sanctions on North Korea is one of the key tasks facing the country.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to continue to ensure that Iran fully meets its commitments under the nuclear deal; to make sure that we\u2019re enforcing effective sanctions on North Korea; that, at our upcoming summit here in Washington, we\u2019re continuing to increase nuclear security,\u201d Obama said during an address at a conference of chiefs of U.S. diplomatic missions overseas\u00a0As tensions flare, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se had a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi late Monday to review the newly passed UNSC resolution and the current security situation.\u00a0\u201cDuring the talks, Yun stressed the need to focus more on thoroughly implementing sanctions as North Korea directly defies the resolution and constantly makes threats of provocations,\u201d spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","702":"South Korea warned North Korea Tuesday that it will face \"unbearable punishment\" if it conducts further provocations following its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year.The warning came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his country would soon conduct tests of nuclear warheads and ballistic rockets to improve its nuclear strike capabilities. Kim made the remarks while attending a simulation of the atmospheric re-entry of a long-range rocket, according to the North's state media.\"If North Korea directly challenges the international community's united resolve and conducts another provocation, it will face the international community's unbearable punishment and take the path to self-destruction,\" Cho June-hyuck, spokesperson of Seoul's Foreign Ministry, said during a regular press briefing.Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council slapped tough sanctions on North Korea to punish it for its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and long-range rocket launch on Feb. 7. South Korea, the United States and other countries have also imposed separate bilateral sanctions on the communist state in an effort to cut off its means to develop weapons of mass destruction.Kim's threats amount to a declaration that North Korea will carry out further provocations, Cho said, adding South Korea and the international community \"will not tolerate it.\" (Yonhap)","703":"A number of minor progressive parties have been formed a month ahead of the upcoming parliamentary race, the country's election watchdog said Tuesday, a sign of general distrust toward the country's political establishment.The National Election Commission (NEC) said a total of 23 parties were formally registered as of last week. In February 2015, there were 16 political parties in the country. Except for the four parties currently holding seats in the National Assembly -- the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party, the People's Party and the Justice Party -- 19 are extra-parliamentary, according to the commission.Another 19 organizations have enrolled preparatory committees to establish political parties, the NEC said.In South Korea, a political party can be registered when it has at least five municipal branches with more than 1,000 members enrolled at each one.In February, the People's Union Party, a coalition of parties comprised of young adults, farmers and laborers, held an inauguration ceremony. It has over 20,000 members, according to its spokesman Song Young-woo.The party promised to solve the issues of youth unemployment and non-regular employees.\"Our goal is to make inroads into the parliament by winning votes in the polls,\" Song said.Some other parties are formed with an aim to voice their interests and enhance publicity without going through an official register process.A group of disabled people formed an organization under the name of a political party but did not enroll it with the election committee nor register it with a preparatory committee.Other unique parties include a group supporting the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon or a group calling for compensation to wartime forced laborers.\"The phenomenon seems to reflect people's distrust of the existing parties,\" said Lee Nae-young, a professor at Seoul's Korea University. He said such parties are being formed because people want to better voice their views and push forward certain agendas. Related to the increase in the number of parties, the election commission said the newly created parties must meet certain requirements, such as registering candidates in local elections, to keep their formal status.On April 6, 2012, a total of 25 parties were registered with the national election commission. The number shrank to seven right after the 2012 general elections took place on April 11, the commission said.

(Yonhap)The Seoul Central District Court found the defendants not guilty, saying the agent, identified only by her surname Kim, was not held in captivity as she could have left the house if she wanted. The court also said they did not have the intention to detain Kim.\"The defendants asked Kim to come out and submit her computer or to open the door and let them check the computer,\" the court said. It added such action cannot be deemed as confining somebody, setting aside the question of whether that violates other laws. She seems to have voluntarily decided not to leave out of concern secrets related to her duty could leak if she went out, the court added.\"I have been frustrated during the course of the trial, witnessing prosecutors and experts serving the power,\" Lee told reporters after the ruling was delivered. \"I appreciate the people for keeping their eyes on this case until the ruling was made.\"Prosecution immediately resisted the ruling, saying it is hard to accept the decision based on legal principles. \"We will thoroughly review the written judgment and decide whether to appeal the ruling,\" said a senior prosecutor, asking not to be named.

We are in orbit. We conquered Jupiter,\u201d said Scott Bolton, NASA\u2019s principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas.\u201cIt is almost like a dream coming true.\u201dJuno launched five years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida and has traveled 2.7 billion kilometers since then.(From left) Diane Brown, NASA Juno program executive, Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator, Juno Project manager Rick Nybakken and Guy Beutelschies, Lockheed Martin director of space exploration, celebrate at a press conference after the Juno spacecraft was successfully placed into Jupiter's orbit, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California on July 4, 2016.Its arrival marks the start of a 20-month mission, during which scientists hope to find out more about how much water Jupiter holds and the makeup of its core in order to figure out how the gas giant -- and other planets including Earth -- formed billions of years ago.\u201cThis amazing universe that we see, how does that work and how did it begin?\u201d asked NASA project scientist Steve Levin.\u201cThat is one of the amazing things about working for NASA and working on big projects. You get to answer big questions.\u201dThe spacecraft is equipped with nine science instruments, including a camera, which prior to orbit captured a video of Jupiter and its moons gliding around it at different speeds.\u201cIn all of history we've never really been able to see the motion of any heavenly body against another,\u201d said Bolton, after showing the video during a post-orbit press conference for the first time.\u201cThis is the king of our solar system and its disciples going around it,\u201d he said.\u201cTo me, it is very significant. We are finally able to see with real video, with real pictures, this movement and we have only been able to imagine it up until today.\u201d All non-essential equipment was turned off for the approach, but the first post-orbit pictures from the spacecraft\u2019s on-board camera should arrive in a few days, NASA said.Juno\u2018s inaugural lap around the solar system\u2019s most massive planet -- the fifth from the sun -- will last 53 days. Subsequent orbits will be shorter, about two weeks each.The first mission designed to see beneath Jupiter\u2018s clouds, Juno is named after the Roman goddess who was the wife of Jupiter, the god of the sky in ancient mythology. The spacecraft orbits Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet\u2019s polar regions.Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter\u2018s icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life.Although Juno is not the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, NASA says its path will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989.That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter\u2019s moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge into Jupiter in 2003.Juno\u2018s orbital track is closer than Galileo\u2019s -- this time within 5,000 kilometers above the cloud tops.With an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years.Earlier Monday, Heidi Becker, senior engineer on radiation effects at NASA\u2018s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described the close approach as going \u201cinto the scariest part of the scariest place ... part of Jupiter\u2019s radiation environment where nobody has ever been.\u201dA leading concern has been radiation levels -- as high as 100 million X-rays in the course of a year, she explained.Those high-energy electrons, moving at the speed of light, \u201cwill go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don\u2018t do anything about it,\u201d she said.\u201cSo we did a lot about it,\u201d she added, describing the half-inch-thick layer of titanium that protects the electronics in a vault to bring the radiation dose down. (AFP)","707":"Korea's kimchi consumption is falling, despite the country being the originator of the pickled side dish, and even those being served on dining tables are often imports from China, research results showed Wednesday.According to an industry analysis by the World Institute of Kimchi in Seoul, Koreans on average consumed 25.3 kilograms of the dish at home in 2015. This roughly translates to daily consumption of 62.9 grams per person, an 11 percent fall from the estimate by the health ministry in 2010.The institute's research found that 2 out of 100 Koreans hadn't eaten kimchi for an entire year, and more than half of this group said they hadn't because their daily diet was mostly Western foods, such as bread and cereal.As alarming as the consumption fall is, there's also a sharp increase in kimchi imports from China, the institute said. Imports of kimchi jumped from $51.34 million in 2005 to $112.37 million in 2015, and 99.9 percent of them came from China, according to the research. South Korea's exports of the food, on the other hand, fell from $92.96 million in 2005 to $73.54 million in 2015.The Codex Alimentarius Committee in July 2001 recognized Korean kimchi as the global standard, giving it official recognition over other varieties, including \"kimuchi\" from Japan. In December 2013, UNESCO designated Korea's \"kimjang,\" the process of making kimchi, an intangible cultural heritage.\"We have been making efforts to globalize kimchi, but we have been neglecting our own home market, which is a big part of the world market,\" the institute said.\u00a0 \"Even if the home market grows, local kimchi manufacturers will not see any growth if imports continue to dominate,\" it said. \"It's important to increase kimchi exports, but it's also urgent that we have measures to improve competitiveness in the local market.\" (Yonhap)","708":"The Korea government said Wednesday it will shut down 10 aged coal-fired power plants in the coming 10 years and no longer build new ones as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and tackle worsening fine dust emissions.The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said that it will close 10 coal stations aged 30 years or over, with a combined capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts, one by one when they reach the end of their respective operational life span.Two power plants on the country's west coast will face the first shutdown in 2018, with the closure program to be completed by 2025.\"We will not allow new coal plants to be built in the country,\" said Deputy Trade Minister Chae Hee-bong said in a briefing. \"Only renewable green energy power stations will produce electricity in the country.\"The outdated coal plants have been singled out as the main culprits of fine dust, along with old diesel vehicles. Out of 53 coal power plants operating in South Korea, 10 are over 30 years old.Coal-powered electricity accounted for 28 percent of the country's total power production in 2015, following by nuclear power with 33 percent.The government will inject 2 trillion won ($1.73 billion) to help retrofit eight coal generators aged 20 year old or over to improve their efficiency and reduce sulfuric acid emissions.The remaining 35 plants will be equipped with desulfurization system, added the ministry.The plan details the follow-up measures to the Korean government's efforts unveiled last month to control fine dust which has recently emerged as one of the biggest threats to public health, as the country has increasingly become more dust-polluted.Fine dust refers to particles that are smaller than 10 micrometers and have been known to cause various respiratory problems while also affecting the body's immune system.The country has been experiencing frequent ultrafine alerts especially in the spring, with people required to refrain from outdoor activities.Trade Minister Joo Hyung-hwan said the latest plan will decrease fine dust by 24 percent by 2030.\"We will invest a total of 10 trillion won ($8.6 billion) to carry out the plan by 2030,\" said the minister. \"As a result, the percentage of coal-fired power will decrease to 26.2 percent in 2029 from the current 28 percent.\" (Yonhap)","709":"The U.S. State Department is expected to submit a report on North Korea's human rights abuses to Congress this week, and the document is likely to name North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responsible for the situation, a diplomatic source said Tuesday.Under the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act enacted in February, the State Department is required to submit a specific report on Pyongyang's human rights abuses within 120 days of enactment. That deadline passed on June 17.The department is expected to submit the report this week as it is unable to delay any longer, and the report is expected to mention the North's leader, the source said on condition of anonymity. The report can be used as a basis for what would be the first-ever U.S. sanctions on the North over the country's human rights record. News reports have said that the U.S. is expected to blacklist about 10 North Korean officials. Should Kim be included in the report, he is also expected to be blacklisted.It has been widely believed that the report will include a direct mention of the North's leader after Amb. Robert King, special representative for North Korean human rights issues, strongly suggested it during a visit to Seoul last week.\"With regard to human rights, one of the things that has to be reported on is Kim Jong-un's role and so, there will be probably something about him in the report,\" King said at the time in an interview with a TV station in Seoul.King also said the department was doing final checks on the report, and would be able to release the report \"in the next few days, maybe next week or so.\"The report is the latest in a series of measures the U.S. is taking to increase pressure on the North.The U.S. has led the U.N. Security Council to adopt the toughest sanctions ever on Pyongyang while enacting its own unilateral sanctions on the communist nation in the wake of the North's fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month.Last month, the Treasury Department also designated the North as a \"primary money laundering concern,\" a powerful sanction designed to cut off the provocative regime from the international banking system for defiantly pursuing nuclear and missile development.

Lee (Jung-hyun) clearly violated the broadcasting act,\u201d said Rep. Park Beom-kye of The Minjoo Party of Korea.The regular two-day session, during which lawmakers question government officials over state affairs, ran from Monday to Tuesday this week, with the first day on economic issues and the second on noneconomic ones.Rep. Lee, a third-termer and former senior presidential secretary for public affairs, is accused of attempting to interfere with Sewol ferry sinking reports that had been critical of the now-defunct Korea Coast Guard\u2019s rescue attempts. The allegation was triggered by a phone conversation between Lee and then-director of public broadcaster KBS Kim Shi-gon, which the Union of Media Workers made public last week upon Kim\u2019s consent.\u201cThe transcript shows that Kim, though he lashed back and resisted at first, ended up succumbing to Rep. Lee\u2019s demands,\u201d Rep. Park said, asserting that Lee\u2019s pressure infringed on the freedom of broadcasting.Rep. Lee Yong-ju of the runner-up opposition People\u2019s Party joined in, slamming Cheong Wa Dae for rationalizing Lee\u2019s action.\u201cNot only does this (issue) require an immediate prosecutorial probe, but also President Park Geun-hye herself should make apologies to the media and to the families of the Sewol ferry victims,\u201d Lee said.He then criticized presidential Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong for his remarks last week. Lee Won-jong had asserted that Lee Jung-hyun\u2019s call was within his scope of duty as the Blue House\u2019s media chief.The Saenuri Party, on the other hand, targeted Chongseon.net, a cluster of liberal civic groups which came under fire for holding anti-campaigns against specific candidates ahead of this year\u2019s April 13 general election.The National Election Commission earlier filed a report to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, accusing the network of conducting illegitimate public polls without making due reports to the watchdog, thus constituting a violation of the Public Official Election Act.\u201cThere should be a reinforced level of supervision on the fund-raising and management process of civic groups, lest they turn politically lopsided during election seasons,\u201d said Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun.Rep. Lee Che-ik added that among the 35 subjects of the anti-campaigns, 33 were Saenuri candidates or conservative-leaning independent runners.Meanwhile, the questioning session was halted in the morning due to scuffles between the rivaling parties.Saenuri floor leader Rep.

While living on her own, she worked for a clothing company, six days a week, and was paid 600,000 won ($508) per month. Due to severe work-related stress and grueling hours, she developed abnormal vaginal bleeding. \u201cIt went on for more than two months,\u201d Ock said in an interview with The Korea Herald. \u201cI had to use sanitary pads every day. And the cost for the pads just became unbearable. I was only getting paid 600,000 won and my monthly rent alone was 200,000 won.\u201dHer difficult first years living in Seoul is what makes Ock empathize with teenagers from low-income households who cannot afford to buy sanitary pads. Ever since Yuhan-Kimberly -- a leading sanitary pad maker here -- announced plans to raise prices of its premium pads by up to 20 percent in May, heartbreaking stories have filled social media here, including instances of girls who had to use shoe insoles as alternatives. Sanitary pads painted in red and signs that protest the stigma and taboo associated with menstruation are struck in Insa-dong, Seoul, Sunday. The signs say: \u201cStudents have to use shoe insoles as alternatives as pads are too expensive\u201d and \u201cWhy are pregnancies and deliveries considered sacred while menstruation is not?\u201d (Yonhap)Ock considered herself lucky. Having been trained in the fashion industry, she managed to create her own reusable sanitary pads by using cotton cloth from her towel. She would hand wash them every night and it involved soaking the used pads in water for a few hours to wash out the bodily fluids first. \u201cI didn\u2019t really mind washing the pads,\u201d she said. \u201cI was used to hand washing my clothes growing up. Yet I just wish no young woman has to struggle because they don\u2019t have access to hygiene products today.\u201dPoverty and reproductive health The ongoing controversy reveals not only the costly price of the products in Korea, but also the effects of poverty and poor menstrual hygiene on young women\u2019s reproductive health. It also highlighted how talking openly about menstruation in Korea is considered a taboo. According to a local news daily, a single sanitary pad in South Korea costs about 260 won ($0.23) to 331 won, which is about 50 to 70 percent more expensive than most other developed nations. In Korea, the average price of sanitary pads rose by 25.6 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to the Korea National Council of Consumer Organizations.Studies have shown that poverty has an impact on young women\u2019s reproductive health. According to lawmaker Rep. Kim Seung-hee\u2019s office, Korean female teenagers who fall under the poorest 10 percent in the country experience reproductive tract infection 1.6 times more frequently than those belonging to the wealthiest 10 percent, based on national health insurance data from 2005-2015.\u00a0According to health care professionals, not changing sanitary pads every three to four hours -- no matter how light the menstrual flow -- can lead to conditions like skin rashes and vaginal infections. \u201cWe can\u2019t conclude that poor menstrual hygiene management is the main cause of reproductive tract infections among young women,\u201d the ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker said. \u201cBut both the statistics on the particular infection and the controversy on sanitary pads have revealed that the country did not look after young women\u2019s basic health needs properly.\u201dAccording to a report by the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, a network of international organizations that work on issues of hygiene and water, millions of girls and women worldwide are subject to \u201crestrictions in their daily lives just because they are menstruating.\u201d The report also pointed out that the lack of, or unaffordability, of appropriate sanitary products and facilities may lead menstruating girls to temporarily or sometimes permanently drop out of school. \u201cThe gender-unfriendly school culture and infrastructure and lack of clean, safe and private sanitation facilities for girls undermine the right of privacy, resulting in a fundamental infringement of human rights,\u201d the report added. It cited research from 2007 that found a relationship between the onset of puberty and significantly reduced school participation among girls, especially in developing countries.\u2018What I had to give up in exchange for pads\u2019Whenever Oh Min-ju had her period, she had to put on a brave face. Having been raised single-handedly by her grandmother, who relied on government subsidies for a major part of her income, Oh always used free pads that were available from her school\u2019s infirmary. \u201cThe pads were free to whoever asked for them,\u201d the 18-year-old told The Korea Herald. \u201cBut most girls went to the infirmary only when they forgot to bring the pads from home. I was the only one who went there every day whenever I was on my period. I had to go often because my flow was so heavy and I was scared the pad may leak.\u201dShe said most of her teachers were understanding, but some of them would scold her for not bringing her own pads or ask unnecessary questions. \u201cI think this teacher was aware of my financial situation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she would always ask me why I get my pads from the infirmary (instead of bringing my own). It was at times humiliating. I acted as if the questions didn\u2019t affect me. But of course I cared. I just had too much pride to show it.\u201dOh dropped out of high school last year to make and save money. Her goal is to enroll in a university famous for its creative writing program after passing a high school diploma qualification exam. Ever since she quit school, she has been working part-time and now purchases her own pads. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would risk my health by using something as unsafe as an alternative to sanitary pads,\u201d she said. \u201cBut purchasing the pads means I sometimes can\u2019t buy the books I need or give up on my snacks.\u201dKim Soo-young, a 17-year-old high school student who has suffered from domestic abuse, currently lives on her own after leaving her family. A relative pays for her monthly rent, but she has to rely on her own income from part-time jobs for all other living expenses. To save money, Kim said she does not use pads at all when her menstrual flow is light. And whenever she is on the night shift, she is too busy to change her pads regularly. \u201cI only have enough pads for my heaviest days,\u201d she said. \u201cI often get skin rashes and it\u2019s painful.\u201dSince the issue was brought to light, both the government and private firms have donated pads for school children who have limited access to hygiene products, but some activists say they should be available for free for all school children from now on. \u201cRight now medicine is free at all school infirmaries, but sanitary pads are not,\u201d said Yeo Gyeong from the nongovernmental organization Womenlink.\u201cAll girls menstruate regardless of their income status, just like any girl can get sick in school regardless of their household income. Those girls who ask for the products in school shouldn\u2019t be shamed. Free and clean pads should be a human right.\u201d\u2018Fight to end period shaming should go mainstream\u2019\u00a0Last month, Park Sam-yong, a fourth-term Gwangju city councilor from the Saenuri Party, said Koreans should stop calling sanitary pads \u201csaengridae,\u201d which is Korean for menstruation pads, and instead start calling them \u201cwisaengdae,\u201d which translates into sanitary pads. His reason was that the word saengri -- meaning menstruation -- is \u201crepulsive\u201d to the public. Han Soo-jin, a 25-year-old Seoulite,\u00a0remembers a particular incident of period shaming when she was in high school. When she accidentally dropped one of her pads in a hallway, her physical education teacher picked it up and threw it at her face. He told her, \u201cYou should be careful and don\u2019t make people feel uncomfortable by making such a careless mistake.\u201dIn response to Park\u2019s remarks, a group of women stuck sanitary pads with red paint on them around central Seoul to protest against the stigma and taboo associated with menstruation. They also held signs that read: \u201cNo uterus, no opinion\u201d and \u201cMenstrual blood is not blue.\u201d The latter refers to a story that recently went viral: A woman recently found out that her boyfriend had thought all along that menstrual blood was blue, as he had only seen the blue liquid used in feminine hygiene TV commercials. In Australia, a campaign recently replaced the common blue liquid used to represent menstrual blood. It features instead a bunch of furious-looking people in red suits to demonstrate that they are locked in a \u201cprison\u201d of padded cell.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with women\u2019s menstrual blood,\u201d said Jeong Ji-hye, a 31-year-old office worker. \u201cI never really thought about it, but the ongoing controversy makes me wonder why menstrual blood has to be shown as blue liquid on TV in the first place. The blood is not harmful.\u201dLee Soo-yeon, a researcher from the Korea Women\u2019s Development Institute, said the general public perceives menstruation as something private and not to be openly talked about, contrary to pregnancies and deliveries that are often portrayed as \u201csacred.\u201d She said the common practice of providing black plastic bags for feminine hygiene products at stores -- apparently to hide it -- is one prevalent example of period shaming in Korea.\u201cI definitely think the perception should change,\u201d she said. \u201cMenstruation should be talked about in a more open manner, in a more positive context. The products don\u2019t need to be hidden in public places.\u201dInspired by her personal experience, Ock now runs a business selling reusable menstrual products made with cotton cloth. Although she started using her reusable pads because she could not afford disposable ones, Ock said she in fact experienced health benefits by using reusable products, such as fewer occurrence of skin rashes. When some activists suggested donating reusable pads to teenagers living under the poverty line last month, critics called the idea \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and even \u201cridiculous.\u201d They said such products cannot be used by those who share rooms with male family members, or those who do not have adequate washing and drying facilities at home. Yet Oh, who recently benefitted from Ock\u2019s donation of her products, said the presence of male family members should not prevent any woman from using reusable pads, if that is what she prefers. Not being able to hang up a reusable pad to dry just because there is a male family member in the house is unfair and is a clear example of period shaming, she added. \u201cI have a good washing machine and I only live with my grandmother,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve changed my mind even if I did (live with a male family member). There\u2019s nothing wrong with washing and hang drying sanitary pads. If someone in the house is uncomfortable, it\u2019s their problem.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com) Kim Soo-young and Han Soo-jin are not their real names.

It added that planes belonging to the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force took part in the maneuvers that targeted North Korea, the media outlet claimed.According to South Korean officials, the U.S. strategic bombers from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam conducted flights in skies near the Korean Peninsula and Japan between June 13 and 20.The B-52 Stratofortress, which can be armed with long-range nuclear air-to-ground missiles, took part in the flight along with other U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps units.The KCNA then said the United States is the main culprit behind the looming nuclear war threat on the Korean Peninsula, saying the superpower has no right to talk about denuclearization.It said that the U.S. used the B-52s to conduct a \"nuclear bomb-dropping drill\" on June 21, saying that the \"nuclear maniacs\"in Washington worked out a scenario for a \"precision air raid operation\" against the nuclear and military facilities of North Korea.North Korea said that \"a formation of nuclear strategic bombers B-52H under the 8th Air Force of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces on Guam was busy with a nuclear bomb dropping drill in South Korea on June 17 under the pretext of the exercise for long-range flight and strike at strategic targets.\" (Yonhap)","713":"The South Korean military was not aware of a U.S. Air Force B-52 strategic bomber deployment last month that took place in the vicinity of the country, officials said Monday.According to Pacific Air Forces, strategic bomber crews and support airmen at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam conducted eight joint and bilateral training exercises across the Indo-Asia-Pacific region from June 13 through June 20.The exercises involved flying the nuclear capable B-52 Stratofortress for a training mission in the vicinity of Korea and Japan.\u00a0(yonhap)Boeing\u2019s subsonic bomber is capable of carrying up to 32 metric tons of weapons and has a combat range of over 14,000 kilometers without aerial refueling. The aircraft had been deployed to the Korean Peninsula in January, in what local observers suspected was a show of force as a warning in response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear test on Jan. 6.Pyongyang last month pushed ahead with what is assessed to be the first successful launch of its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile, leading experts to believe that recent training is aimed to warn against the North\u2019s nuclear and missile ambitions. Musudan is expected to have a maximum range that would put the U.S.\u2019s Guam base within its range.But while the training is believed to have taken place near the Korean Peninsula, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was oblivious to its presence. A JCS official said that the U.S. military has not notified them of the details of the exercise, particularly whether or not the \u201cvicinity\u201d indicates that the aircrafts may not have flown exclusively over international waters. He said that while it is not \u201ccommon\u201d for the U.S. military to conduct training near the peninsula without first telling its ally, it is not unprecedented.A personnel member familiar with matters related to U.S. Forces in Korea said the U.S. military is not obligated to alert local forces if the training takes place over international waters, not directly over the country\u2019s territory itself. The Korean liaison to the USFK was not aware of the situation\u2019s details and refrained from commenting on the matter.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","714":"The U.S. Democratic Party has released the final draft of its policy platform ahead of the upcoming presidential convention, vowing to bolster the alliance with South Korea and push back against North Korean aggression.\"North Korea is perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator. It has conducted several nuclear tests and is attempting to develop the capability to put a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile that could directly threaten the United States,\" the platform said.\"Yet Donald Trump praises North Korea's dictator, threatens to abandon our treaty allies, Japan and South Korea, and encourages the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. This approach is incoherent and rather than solving a global crisis, would create a new one,\" it said.The platform also said that Democrats will \"protect America and our allies, press China to restrain North Korea, and sharpen the choices for Pyongyang to compel it to abandon its illegal nuclear and missile programs.\"The Korea part in the draft was largely similar to a foreign policy speech that Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivered last month, highlighting the differences in the values she and Trump attach to American allies.\"From the Asia Pacific to the Indian Ocean, we will deepen our alliances in the region with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand,\" the platform said. \"We will push back against North Korean aggression and press China to play by the rules.\"The draft platform is expected to be endorsed by the full 187-member platform committee later this week before being formally adopted when the party holds its presidential convention in Philadelphia later this month to formally select Clinton as its presidential nominee.On economic issues, the party was critical of free trade and vowed a review of trade deals.\"Over the past three decades, America has signed too many trade deals that have not lived up to the hype. Trade deals often boosted the profits of large corporations, while at the same time failing to protect workers' rights, labor standards, the environment and public health,\" the draft said.\"Democrats believe we should review agreements negotiated years ago to update them to reflect these principles. Any future trade agreements must make sure that our trading partners cannot undercut American workers by taking shortcuts on labor policy or the environment,\" it said.But the party does not have a clear position on whether it supports or rejects the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership free trade deal awaiting legislative approval, only saying there is a diversity of views in the party.Trump has also been highly critical of free trade deals.In an economic speech last week, the real-estate tycoon vowed to pull out of the TPP if elected president. He also said he would immediately renegotiate NAFTA to get a better deal, and withdraw from the deal unless Canada and Mexico agree to a renegotiation.

(Yonhap)","716":"North Korea is believed to have almost doubled the number of landmines it has planted in the Demilitarized Zone that bisects the two Koreas this year from the previous year, South Korean military officials said Sunday.Since April, the North has placed more than 4,000 new landmines in the DMZ, and 70 to 80 percent of them are believed to be wooden-box land mines which are hard to detect, according to the officials.\"The military is focusing on searching for landmines buried by North Korea on concerns that they can be washed away from the North during the heavy rainy season,\" said a military official.In the summer, wooden-box land mines sometimes make their way south due to elevated water levels during the heavy rainy season.The North Korean military is suspected to deliberately set mines to be washed away by the torrential rains.The South Korean military said it is also keeping close tabs on the North's possible implantation of landmines near the DMZ.In August last year two South Korean soldiers were seriously injured by a landmine explosion at the DMZ blamed on North Korea.Millions of landmines are believed to have been laid on the divided peninsula during the 1950-53 Korean War, particularly in the DMZ.The two Koreas still remain technically at war since the three-year war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. (Yonhap)","717":"The floor leader of South Korea's main opposition party said Sunday he is opposed to moves that would abolish a lawmaker privilege that exempts him or her from liability from speeches made in parliament.Rep. Woo Sang-ho of the Minjoo Party of Korea said that while he will take the lead in getting rid of various privileges enjoyed by lawmakers that have drawn public flak, certain rights need to be maintained if the National Assembly is to provide checks and balances to the executive branch of government.\"Once a committee is set up aimed at abolishing privileges enjoyed by lawmakers, political parties will be asked to take part in the deliberation process along with outside experts to screen which rights need to go and what has to be preserved,\" the third term lawmaker said.The remarks come after Minjoo took criticism when one of its members was accused of nepotism.On the issue of exemption from liability, which has often been used to make unfounded statements that do not have supporting evidence, the party whip pointed out that the right is critical for opposition lawmakers to do their job.\"This is something that has been written into the country's Constitution so as to allow important issues to be raised for public debate,\" Woo claimed.The party leader said that lawmakers should not view immunity from liability as a right that can be abused.

He is welcomed by a representative of a U.S.-based firm, who wastes no time in explaining his complaints and demands related to doing business in Korea.The translator opens his mouth, only to be stopped mid-sentence by the director.\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll take it from here. I can speak English,\u201d he says. He then goes on struggling to sustain a conversation with less-than-perfect, if not downright broken English.\u201cIt was a bizarre sight. He told me not to translate, and just write down the conversation,\u201d said the in-house translator, who works\u00a0for a government agency. He wished not to be identified.\u00a0\u201cOf the officials in high-ranking positions, people who think they speak English well enough are reluctant about using a translator, even though it is clear that they can benefit from professional assistance. This is because they feel compelled to appear as though they are fluent in English to save face,\u201d he said.(123rf)The incident, witnessed on several occasions by the translator, was a reminder of how fluency in English is considered a yardstick in one\u2019s ability in studies, work and life.While many companies say they look past academic credentials when hiring new employees, most of them still require certified English scores with their applications.Even people already secure in their jobs are required to study English in order to move up the company ladder.A survey by YBM, a private education provider that also runs the Test of English for International Communication in Korea, showed that 87.6 percent of employees felt they needed to study English regardless of the type of work they do.The top reasons were \u201cfor their own development,\u201d \u201cto move to another job\u201d or \u201cto be promoted.\u201d\u201cMore companies are requiring applicable English skills when looking for someone to promote, so a fairly high number of office workers are preparing for TOEIC and other certified English tests in parallel to working,\u201d an YBM official said.Aside from promotions at work, English skills of prominent figures have often also become a topic of interest among Koreans.A video comparing the reaction to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s speech from native English speakers and Koreans went viral online a few years ago. The video, originally aired by the Educational Broadcasting System, had aimed to remind that the content of the speech -- not the native speaker-like pronunciation -- was vital to conversation.The program delved into different reactions among Koreans and English speakers, with the former being ruthless in judging Ban\u2019s rather \u201ccandid\u201d pronunciation of English.\u00a0\u00a0 U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (Yonhap)The public\u2019s interest in Ban\u2019s English skills and how fluent they thought he did or did not sound indeed acted as a testament to Koreans\u2019 obsession over English and being absolutely perfect in it, right down to native-like intonation.English lecturer Jake K. Lee had even once said, \u201cKoreans are perhaps the only people who take issue with the U.N. secretary-general\u2019s (English) pronunciation.\u201d While Ban\u2019s case showed Koreans\u2019 high standards in English, another case involving President Park Geun-hye showed high-ranking officials\u2019 eagerness to show off their linguistic capacities.Since taking office, President Park Geun-hye has gained a reputation for giving speeches in the language of the country she visits. In her latest U.S. visit in 2015, she delivered three of a total of seven speeches at the U.N. in English.While her choice of language may have been out of courtesy to the host country or for efficiency, her aides wasted no time touting the president\u2019s global competitiveness showcased through her -- albeit prewritten -- English speeches.The hype immediately prompted criticism, chiefly from opposition camps. Former lawmaker Kim Han-gil of the minor opposition People\u2019s Party criticized the tendency, saying a leader using his or her mother tongue during speeches was a matter of national pride.The media and the general public, meanwhile, were entertained.Upon Park\u2019s English speech to the joint session of U.S. Congress in 2013, for instance, search terms such as \u201cPark Geun-hye,\u201d \u201cU.S. Congress\u201d and \u201cEnglish speech\u201d brought up scores upon scores of stories on Park\u2019s English speeches.Among them were: \u201cPark\u2019s English speech applauded 41 times at the U.S. Congress ... Frantic reaction,\u201d \u201cPark\u2019s English speech receives standing ovations,\u201d \u201cPark to stand at the U.S. Congress later today with an English speech,\u201d \u201cPark speaks English fluently at the Congress ... Applauded 40 times.\u201dWhat the headlines didn\u2019t describe was the content of the speech, which was her vision for peace in Northeast Asia.While these articles were featured in the \u201clighter\u201d part of the news, it showed just how much the Korean media and the public are interested in fluent English speaking and whether such ability is approved by the audience of native speakers.The tendency to equate one\u2019s English ability to one\u2019s intellectual competence appears to derive mostly from the fact that English is often treated as an academic field that one must master, rather than a linguistic capacity as a tool, according to observers.English education in Korea can be traced back as far as the late 19th century, and has remained one of the key subjects since Seoul National University established English and English education majors in 1946. The Education Ministry\u2019s report in February showed that of the 190,000 won ($165) per month spent for private education on average by students, the greatest amount was devoted to studying English, at 80,000 won.Kim Chang-eun, the head of a Korean school in Yantai, China, said his curriculum is largely based on regular Korean educational curriculum, but devotes extra periods to foreign languages like English and Chinese. He explained that this is to assure that the students will be competent in entering university, including universities in Korea.The Korean curriculum\u2019s extreme emphasis on the language is what many Koreans perceive as one of key demonstrations of the country\u2019s obsession with English.\u201cIn school, \u2018fluent English speaker\u2019 would often mean \u2018good student,\u2019 as only the top students get to be any good in English,\u201d said 31-year-old Hong, himself a graduate of English literature at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. \u201cStudents who excel in English would often stand out in class, even more so than students who did well in other subjects because it was seen as a rarer talent.\u201d Some experts say a deeply rooted inferiority complex, admiration for English-speaking societies and the fixation on continuing\u00a0the country\u2019s industrialization with globalization may be factors behind the English craze.In the book \u201cKorean and English,\u201d author Gang Jun-man describes the deeply rooted English craze via 1930s advertisements in the Chosun Ilbo newspaper. \u201cOld or young, if you don\u2019t speak English, there is only darkness in today\u2019s world\u201d and \u201cThose who do not know English are the losers of the society,\u201d the ad copy read.Gang said English has been used as a means to gain power since colonial times, with many prominent figures using the language to move up the social ladder and top-tier universities adopting English tests for entrance exams even back then. The 1962 novel \u201cKapitan Lee\u201d depicts an opportunistic protagonist who survives the turbulent years of Japanese occupation, liberation and division via studying Russian, then English. Korea\u2019s earliest politicians, including former presidents Syngman Rhee and Yun Po-sun, were fluent English speakers.The previous Lee Myung-bak administration upped the emphasis on English education, with some such as right-leaning novelist Bok Geo-il saying Korea should make English an official language. The proponents of the wider use of English have said it would enhance the \u201cinternational competence\u201d of Koreans.But Kim Young-myung, a professor of social science at Hallym University and an advocate of Hangeul use, harshly opposed the move, saying it appeared as \u201cthoughtless worshipping of the outside power.\u201d He pointed out in his column that there was no substantial evidence that a society\u2019s collective English-speaking ability leads to competence. While advocates of wider English use stresses \u201cglobalization,\u201d there is more to globalization than just speaking the language, he wroteThe obsession over English and the consequent social expectations have led to English being a coveted trait, especially among those in the higher positions. The aforementioned translator said that high-ranking officials who tried to flaunt their insufficient English skills often ended up misleading the entire discussion with their foreign counterparts.\u201cIt appears to be fine from an outside point of view. Because this person holds a prominent position (in the government), the foreigner would not be overly aggressive in the conversation. He or she would just move on from a misunderstood or not-really-answered questions,\u201d he said.\u201cThe official himself would think that the conversation is going well, which is frustrating from my standpoint. He is actually risking the interest of the organization he is representing in order to protect his \u2018elite\u2019 status.\u201dKim Doh-yeon, president of Pohang University of Science and Technology, pointed out in his recent column that many majors in science and engineering are \u201cwasting time\u201d studying English when they don\u2019t really need to.\u201cNinety percent of the people will face the necessity to speak English only once or twice a year. ... Yet, the English studying becomes a burden to us all because the society, for some reason, believes that English speaking ability is a barometer to an individual\u2019s intellectual capacity,\u201d he wrote.\u201cEnglish is merely a means of communication, not a tool to assess one\u2019s abilities. We should discard the \u2018myth\u2019 that only people who speak English well are the elite.\u201dBy Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","719":"A 64-year-old woman received 10 years in prison Sunday for hiring someone to murder her ex-husband.

(Yonhap)","722":"South Korean U.N. Ambassador Oh Joon called Thursday for stringent implementation of U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea, saying making its nuclear weapons development more difficult and costly is the only way to force it to reconsider its ambitions.Oh made the appeal during a discussion that the U.N. missions of South Korea, the U.S., and Japan hosted to check on progress in carrying out the latest Security Council sanctions imposed on the North for its fourth nuclear test in January.The envoy said that through the past four nuclear tests, the North demonstrated it has no sincere intention to negotiate away its nuclear program, and the only remaining option left for the rest of the world is to get the North to rethink its nuclear policy by making it more difficult and costly for the regime to develop nuclear weapons.Effective implementation of sanctions is the only way to get the North back to the negotiating table, he said.The latest sanctions are considered the toughest ever to be imposed on Pyongyang as they require mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North by land, sea or air, while banning its exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a key source of hard currency.It also prohibits all small arms and other conventional weapons from being sold to the North, bans jet and rocket fuel supplies to the country, grounds North Korean flights suspected of carrying contraband and denies vessels carrying illicit items access to ports.U.S. Amb. Samantha Power emphasized the importance of the \"catch-all\" provision in the sanctions resolution, which calls for banning the transfer of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of the North's armed forces or the transfer by the North of any item that directly contributes to operational capabilities of the armed forces of other countries.Japan's ambassador, Koro Bessho, said the North's nuclear program has become a threat not only to the region, but to the world, emphasizing that cooperation not only from a handful of big countries, but also all U.N. member states is key to curbing the program.

The prompt response by Samsung was deemed as an attempt to protect investors and stabilize the market. Lee was hospitalized on May 10, 2014, after suffering a heart attack. He was transferred to the Samsung Medical Center the next morning, where he underwent a procedure to widen his blood vessels.

Defying many who predicted otherwise, the husband survived the crash, following numerous surgeries from the PMC where he remained hospitalized for three months for recuperation. Kang did not have enough money to pay for the medical service then, as the couple had not long before failed in a grocery store business they jointly ran. The hospital head surgeon, showing compassion for the couple, took payment of only 700,000 won from the total 7.8 million won bill.The aftereffects of the accident prevented Kang\u2019s husband from working, and Kang spent the next 34 years as the breadwinner of the family, raising their children through seamstress jobs.Kang said she always lived with a debt in her heart for the hospital, which eventually led to her payment after all these years. The pastor of the church Kang attends had supported her decision, saying that although the currency value had jumped over the years, it would be meaningful for her to repay the principal.

Kim Jong-il is the incumbent leader's late father.\"The North's leader completed the power structure change in the way he wanted,\" the ministry handling inter-Korean affairs said.\"In terms of the concentration of power, the new apparatus appears not to be far different from the NDC.\"The assembly was held as a follow-up to the congress by the Workers' Party of Korea in May, where the North's leader was elected to the post of party chairman.The NDC mainly focused on defense and security-related affairs, but the role of the new commission was expanded to other sectors, including unification, diplomacy and the economy, the ministry said.\"The commission on state affairs is expected to serve as a key decision-making body under the guidance of the party's bureau on political affairs,\" it added.Kim's move to replace the NDC with the new organ appears to be aimed at stepping out of his late father's shadow, analysts said.The country's founder Kim Il-sung was named North Korea's \"eternal president\" in 1998 following his death in 1994. In 2012, Kim Jong-il was called \"eternal chairman\" of the NDC.\"The authority of the new institution's chairman was strengthened to reassert Kim's power as the supreme leader,\" said Chang Yong-seok, a researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.At the assembly, the country also decided to upgrade the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which handles inter-Korean affairs, to a state-level organization.\"The move appears to be aimed at strengthening its charm offensive toward South Korea,\" the ministry said.Since the party congress ended, the North has proposed holding military talks with South Korea several times.But Seoul has rejected the North's dialogue offer as a propaganda ploy, saying that denuclearization steps should be prioritized as a precondition for dialogue.

Local police are reviewing whether such offenses against the prime minister are chargeable.\"It is regrettable that the government made Seongju residents anxious over the deployment of the THAAD,\" Hwang said. \"The government will outline comprehensive development plans for Seongju.\"The prime minister added he will expand communications with Seongju to help residents better understand the safety of the defense system. (Yonhap)","727":"Foreign and local experts from human rights organizations and academia addressed on Tuesday the danger of the use of water cannons by South Korean police at street rallies and called for better protection of human rights in keeping the public order. An association of human rights organizations investigating the use of police force in last year\u2019s antigovernment rallies held a symposium in Seoul, bringing together a former German judge, a British campaigner and Korean activists and scholars.The event kicked off with a video showing Korean farmer Baek Nam-gi being knocked down by a water cannon blast last November at an antigovernment protest that spiraled into violence. In the video, the water cannon was directly aimed at Baek, even after he had collapsed, with those surrounding him urgently shouting for help. Experts attend a press conference in Seoul, Monday, a day before they participated in a symposium on South Korea\u2019s use of water cannons held at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Baek Do-ra-ji, the daughter of the farmer who remains unconscious, criticized what she saw as the government\u2019s violent oppression of protests and its inaction to bring justice for her father. \u201cIn a democratic country, it is not possible to hold an illegal rally. All the rallies are legal (based on the constitutional freedom of speech),\u201d she said. \u201cMore than half of my father\u2019s brain was severely damaged, so doctors said that it would be hard to expect him to regain consciousness. His condition is getting worse day by day.\u201d \u201cBut our family has never received any apology from the government,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have filed complaints against seven police officials (involved in the use of water cannons during the protest), but nothing is being done,\u201d she added, arguing that her father\u2019s injury is a criminal case. The prosecution is currently investigating the case.Dieter Reicherter, a former judge at the regional court of Stuttgart, cited a similar case in Germany -- the 2010 protest in Stuttgart against the large-scale redevelopment project known as Stuttgart 21. \u201cThe police used batons, capsaicin and water cannons, which resulted in several serious injuries,\u201d Reicherter said, referring to Deitrich Wagner, a German who lost his eyesight after being struck in the face. \u201cThis was a very traumatic experience for many of them as well as for many adults, leading them to lose their confidence in a democratic country governed by the rule of law.\u201d \u201cOnly public pressure and engagement of lawyers criticizing the state violence in the rally brought the result years later,\u201d he said, citing the German court\u2019s ruling in favor of the protestors who sustained injuries in the crackdown. Three of the German police officers were found guilty of negligence in the verdict in which the court said that \u201cinterventions like these place the strongest possible restrictions on freedom of assembly,\u201d and that \u201cit is questionable whether use of the water jets was appropriate.\u201d Sam Hawke, a policy assistant at a Britain-based civil rights advocacy group Liberty, shared how his organization successfully blocked the U.K. government\u2019s attempt to introduce water cannons in 2015. \u201cBy the time of the 2011 riots, the U.K. police already appeared to be adopting more confrontational, even militarized methods of protest policing,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIn 2010, for example, officers clad in full riot-gear kettled (contained) large numbers of student protestors indiscriminately for several hours.\u201d The British Home Affairs Ministry refused to allow the use of water cannon in England and Wales in 2015 amid opposition from the public, saying that the tool has the capacity to cause harm without safeguards. The rejection came after then-London Mayor Boris Johnson authorized the purchase of three second-hand cannons in 2014 to be used in the event of a serious public disorder.\u201cIf police use indiscriminate weapons which imply every protestor is a potential enemy, the police will likely treat them as such. While some protestors are likely to flee in the face of water cannons, others will anticipate its use and take on an aggressive posture as a means of defense,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cA vicious cycle begins, since the police\u2019s likely response is to heighten intimidation as a further defensive measure.\u201d Hawke stressed the importance of \u201cproportionate policing\u201d and building trust between protestors and police, given the water cannon\u2019s capacity for brutality and its indiscriminate nature. \u201cThe effective protest policing is best achieved through forward planning, effective communication and the timely deployment of officers to use lawful powers in a proportionate way,\u201d he said. \u201cAbove all, police must facilitate, not prevent, protests.\u201d Lee Ho-joong, a law professor at Sogang University Law School, noted that it is impossible to distinguish those committing violence from peaceful protestors when police use water jets to break up rallies. \u201cGiven that, the use of water cannons at the protest scene is impossible to be used proportionately in the first place. The international law does not directly ban the use of water cannons, but it can be reasonably said that water cannons should be forbidden from use.\u201d Earlier in the day, South Korean police announced a measure to install additional monitors within water cannons to better oversee how they are used on protestors to prevent injuries. They added that the resolution of the monitors will also be improved.Police did not apologize for the Baek Nam-ki incident, maintaining that it was necessary to deploy water cannons to stop \u201cviolent\u201d protests and keep public order. According to the symposium organizers, police were invited to attend to give their stance, but they refused the call, citing the ongoing investigation into Baek\u2019s case.

According to the Seoul Dobong Police, the men are accused of attacking two middle school students in September 2011, when they were high school students.\u00a0(Yonhap)The accused reportedly discovered the underage victims drinking alcohol and threatened to report them to school authorities.According to police, a few days after the encounter, a group of 10 suspects summoned the victims at night to a wooded hill where they coerced the victims into drinking.When one of the victims lost consciousness, four suspects allegedly raped her. A similar attack involving forced drinking took place a few days later, police said, this time with a group of 22 suspects,\u00a06 of whom are accused of committing rape. The other 12 either conspired in the wrongdoing or attempted rape but failed when the victims resisted. The victims reportedly suffered post traumatic stress and depression, and had difficulties sustaining regular lives. One of them halted her studies and went into hiding. The suspects on the other hand were found to have gone on to college or held jobs, leading otherwise average lives up until their arrest. The police said they discovered and tracked down the crime while investigating a separate case in which three of the suspects were involved. Of the 22 suspects, four were arrested for rape while six were booked without detention for conspiring in the violence. Twelve other suspects who are accused of rape are currently serving compulsory military duty, and will be referred to military judicial institutes once the police investigation is complete.

The largest monthly payment reached 1.88 million won. The number of pensioners was up from 3.59 million a year earlier with the total payments also marking an increase from 1.18 trillion won.In 2002, the number of pension recipients stood at 917,000 with pension payments totaling 173.6 billion won. With the national pension system maturing further down the road, the number of pensioners is expected to rise to 5.93 million in 2020 and exceed the 10-million mark in 2030, the NPS said.Senior Koreans are entitled to receive national pension payments after paying premiums for up to 10 years until the age of 60 during their working years.In a report released a week ago, the NPS estimated that 91.3 percent of 17.62 million Koreans aged 65 and older are projected to receive various state pensions in 2060, when the country's national pension fund is estimated to dry up.Experts point out that Korea's aging population is putting a strain on the pension system as the number of elderly grows faster than the labor force due to the chronically low birthrate.Korea is on the verge of becoming an aged society, with the share of senior citizens reaching 13.1 percent of the country's population of 50.62 million last year. A country is defined as an \"aged society\" if more than 14 percent of the population are 65 or older.

At the ceremony on Tuesday, 72 students received certificates for completing the DSD 1 and DSD 2 programs, shortened names for the German Language Certificate of the Education Ministers Conference.By earning these credentials, they are recognized as having the necessary competence to study at German universities or work at Germany-related organizations worldwide. Established in 1973, there are now more than 51,000 students across 1,000 accredited schools in over 65 countries who take the exams each year.\u00a0German Ambassador Rolf Mafael (left) addresses Korean high school students who completed their German language courses provided by the German government beside program coordinator Catrin Inis Beguhl at the embassy on Tuesday. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)\u201cOur bilateral economic cooperation is strong and growing, and those who speak both languages and understand both cultures will be increasingly sought by companies, institutes and schools,\u201d said German Ambassador Rolf Mafael in a speech. \u201cThe German language has become increasingly popular around the world, with 15.5 million learners. Lately, the biggest enrollment is happening in China and India.\u201dIn Korea, the program started in 2008, and German teachers and learning materials have been sent to high schools across the country. The number of German language students in university has grown significantly over the last 5 years, aided by the Goethe-Institut Korea, which runs language and cultural programs. There are currently about 25,000 Koreans students getting their knack of German: some 11,500 in high schools, 5,000 through the Goethe-Institut Korea and 8,500 at universities and other institutions.Since 2012, the language\u2019s popularity has soared, particularly among young adults, the ambassador remarked, adding that three additional Goethe-Instituts have opened in Daegu, Gwangju and Busan following those in Seoul and Daejon.72 students who completed the DSD 1 and DSD 2 programs and their teachers await being given certificates at the German embassy on Tuesday (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)\u201cThe biggest reason seems to be to go to Germany to study, particularly for master\u2019s courses, and to work,\u201d he told The Korea Herald. Noting that many Koreans between the ages 50 and 75 learned German in their youth -- in the 1960s and 70s when Korea dispatched miners and nurses to Germany\u2019s industrial front lines to feed the country\u2019s development -- the envoy said companies have benefitted from hiring those workers\u2019 children, who were well-versed in language and culture. However, with their numbers depleting, companies need fresh new replenishment of human capital, he added. \u201cEveryone told me that if you combine the Korean \u2018ppali-ppali\u2019 (quickly, quickly) mentality and dynamic energy with Germany\u2019s long-term and problem-solving approach, then you really get top talents,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTherefore, we are working hard to increase exchanges in both directions. The number of German university students coming to Korea is continuously rising, and our aim is to reach 1,000 a year from the current 600-700. Some 5,000 Korean students are studying in German universities now, a steady number over the last 10 years.\u201dStudents who completed the DSD 1 and DSD 2 programs and pose after being given certificates at the German embassy on Tuesday (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)Regarding the strengths of German education, Mafael argued that first and foremost, the curriculum is qualitatively even across the country due to Germany\u2019s decentralized history. Mentioning that he has his five sons enrolled in different universities in Germany, Mafael underlined: \u201cWhether you enroll in a top 50 or 100 school in Germany, you can still be guaranteed roughly the same quality of learning as in the top 5 or 10.\u201d Cities such as Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Freiburg, Hamburg and Heidelberg all have competed to nurture top schools, the envoy highlighted, adding that requirements are similarly weighty across regions. As a second strength, he stressed, the country is a world leader in engineering, natural sciences, philosophy and music education. Many master\u2019s programs are offered in English, and strong collaboration between universities and research institutes -- the Max Planck Institutes, the Helmholtz Institutes and the Fraunhofer Society -- helps turn students into professional scholars. To strengthen bilateral cooperation, the Germany-Korea alumni network Adeko -- chaired by former Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik -- hosts an annual conference on science and innovation, with the next event scheduled in August in Dresden. The German Academic Exchange Service operates an office in Seoul, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation provides research grants.Students who completed the DSD 1 and DSD 2 programs and pose after being given certificates at the German embassy on Tuesday (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)As the third advantage, Mafael emphasized the universities combine theory with practice, enabling \u201cvery close links\u201d between students and employers. A new system called the \u201cdual university\u201d allows students to spend half their time studying and the other half apprenticing at firms, which pay for their studies. \u201cSo they get constant feedbacks on what the companies need and how they can apply their lessons. The fastest growing universities in Germany are those that offer this program.\u201dThe Baden-Wurttemberg Cooperative State University is located in the economic powerhouse region in southern Germany. As a cluster of world-leading scientific and industrial innovation, the school excels in engineering, economics, social sciences and hospital-related studies with tailored coop programs. To make the most out of these opportunities, Mafael advised moving to Germany before graduating from Korean universities to undergo various trainee programs and establish job connections. The embassy granted some 2,000 working holiday visas last year, and the Human Resources Development Service of Korea offers programs and information for obtaining jobs in Germany.\u00a072 students who completed the DSD 1 and DSD 2 programs and their teachers await being given certificates at the German embassy on Tuesday (Joel Lee \/ The Korea Herald)Student Kim Na-yeon, 18, who participated in the program for three years, is now majoring in German literature at Hanyang University. Although she did not speak a word of German initially, she said she can now comfortably take university courses in German. Student Lee Na-hee, 17, who is enrolled in the DSD 1 program, said she chose to enroll to maximize communication with native German speakers. Both students said they spent two hours each, two to three days a week, reading, listening and debating in German. Admitting that German is underappreciated in Korea, both highlighted the need to promote the program more. They suggested that a better recognition in university entrance would raise its profile.

Until then, the U.K. will maintain its legal status as a member of the EU in Korea, a law professor said.An employee of the European Union Delegation to South Korea enters the headquarters in central Seoul on Friday, following Great Briton\u2018s referendum to leave the union. Yonhap\u201cBrexit will prompt Korea and the U.K. to reopen free trade negotiations. But for now, it won\u2019t affect the British law firms in the country, as Britain still has two years to pull out of EU,\u201d Kim Sang-kyum, law professor at Dongguk University, told The Korea Herald.\u00a0\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s legal market is relatively small in size and so far, it has mostly been the U.S. law firms who found reason to enter it, so the impact of Brexit will be limited,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, the Justice Ministry and the legal market should evaluate the impact of Brexit and prepare themselves to minimize the fallout.\u201dAs Korea agreed to fully open its market to the EU by July 2016 and the U.S. by March 2017, the Justice Ministry proposed a revised draft of the Foreign Legal Consultant Act last August to implement the final stage of legal market liberalization under the free trade agreements with the countries.\u00a0Under the revised bill, the foreign law firms are allowed to set up joint ventures with Korean counterparts, hire Korean lawyers and partially practice domestic law as the final step. But they are banned from representing clients in Korean courtrooms, owning greater stake than the Korean firm in the joint venture or from handling domestic cases related to labor, inheritance and government affairs.\u00a0A total of 26 law firms from the U.S. and U.K. have opened their offices in Seoul since the trade deals came into effect in 2011 and 2012, respectively, with most of them focusing on offering legal advice for mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property, initial public offerings and cross-border litigation.Though the official figure is not available, the foreign law firms take up an estimated half of the legal consulting market.\u00a0So far, five EU law firms -- Clifford Chance, Allen & Overy, Herbert Smith Freehills, Stephenson Harwood and Linklaters -- have set up operations in Korea. All of them are from the U.K.\u00a0\u201cI seriously doubt the eventual implementation of Brexit will cause any major legal firms to leave Korea,\u201d said Britt Frey, an American doctor of law who is residing in Seoul and familiar with the matter. \u201cIf anything, Brexit will cause an increase in business for U.K. firms here as much more research will need to be done regarding export, import and M&A; between the U.K. and Korea.\u201dKim Kyung-hwa, head of Stephenson Harwood\u2019s Korea branch, told Yonhap News Agency that he expects the two countries to find a way for the next two years. \u201cAs the core of the opening of the legal market under the South Korea-EU FTA is the U.K., there will be no turning back in terms of the bilateral relations.\u201d\u00a0An official from the Justice Ministry said that Great Britain\u2019s status as a free trade partner would not likely change.\u00a0\u201cThe ministry would have to review the U.K.\u2019s legal status after its exit from the EU, but I expect that the U.K. would still enjoy the benefits of the FTA reached (when part of the) EU,\u201d he said. \u201cKorea and the U.K. will launch a talk on clinching a new FTA or add the country to the South Korea-EU FTA while the U.K. conducts negotiations to leave the EU in the coming years.\u201d\u00a0U.K. Ambassador to Korea Charles Hay also said in an interview with a local news outlet following the referendum that Britain\u2019s relationship with Korea will not change in the near future. But it would need a bilateral free trade agreement to replace the South Korea-EU free trade pact that took effect in 2011.\u00a0\u201cFundamentally, I hope that this won\u2019t change because the fundamental policies of the U.K. have not changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to be an outward-looking trading nation. We want to have a very strong trade and investment relationship with Korea.\u201d By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","737":"State-run subway operator Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit said Sunday that it will remove subway turnstiles specially designed for children, in order to curb the increasing number of adult fare dodgers.SMRT has been operating the \u201cchild only\u201d subway turnstiles since 2009, at about 10 subway stations around Seoul on subway lines 5 to 8.Hanging lower than regular turnstiles and decorated with colorful paintings, these facilities were built to make it more convenient for subway passengers accompanied by children under 6.Seoul Metropolitan Rapid TransitBut these charge-free gates have often been abused by adult passengers seeking a free ride.\u201cWe have witnessed a fair amount of adult passengers going through these turnstiles, but it is difficult to detect such fare evaders on a real time basis,\u201d said the SMRT official.The problem of subway fare evasion has long been a strain on subway operators\u2019 budgets.Despite fines of 30 times the original fare, more than 21,431 passengers illegally hopped on trains last year, paying 794 million won ($657,000) in fines, according to Seoul Metro, which operates subway lines Nos. 1 to 4.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","738":"North Korea is continuing to erect new statues of its dead leaders as part of the country's effort to strengthen a cult around the ruling Kim dynasty that has controlled the communist country for nearly seven decades, a U.S.-based news report said Sunday.According to Radio Free Asia, the North is moving to place new statues of the country's founder Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il in front of the country's national defense college and a museum dedicated to the two Kims in Pyongyang.Statues honoring the two dead men were set up in the Ryongsong district of the capital recently, reported the RFA, citing Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University.The analyst said the latest satellite photos showed statues and memorial pillars going up, and that such moves seem to be a key policy decision made by the incumbent leader Kim Jong-un. Kim is the founder's grandson and took over the running of the country after the death of his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011.Melvin told the media outlet that the erecting of statues sped up after the sudden death of Kim Jong-il.Reflecting this data showed that since taking over the helm of the reclusive country, Kim Jong-un ordered more than 250 memorials celebrating Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il to be set up nationwide, with about 35 statues of the two men being erected so far.South Korean watchers said creating a personality cult around the dynasty is designed to legitimize Kim Jong-un's rule over the population, who are taught to follow orders given by their leader without question.

The court has since issued search warrants.Park is scheduled to be questioned on Monday.The prosecution was expected to zero in on what role Kim\u2019s former company actually played and what type of service it was paid for. The party had explained that Brand Hotel was responsible for designing the party\u2019s identity.The prosecution is also investigating another allegation raised by the NEC that the party exaggerated the expenses spent on producing election campaign materials in their application for state reimbursement upon the election.The NEC has reimbursed just 1.59 billion won out of the party\u2019s reported 2.11 billion won spent on campaign materials, saying that the remaining 515 million won was deemed to have been spent excessively based on the general transaction trend.The rebate suspicion has rattled the third-largest party headed by entrepreneur-turned-politician Rep.

Since 2012, all students attending school have been prohibited from bringing cellphones to class, except on specific circumstances such as school trips and outdoor field work. The ban was introduced in 2012 to prevent possible traffic accidents caused by cellphone use, as well as to encourage all students to focus on their studies without being disturbed by their smart devices.\u00a0(123rf)Still, Kim claimed the ban was unfair, as most students did not agree with it, adding that he has been unable to efficiently contact his parents after school, even in emergency situations. Kim\u2019s school is one of the three educational institutions the NHRCK officially advised on Wednesday to ease their ban on cellphone use among students. The human rights watchdog said such practices that prohibit cellphone use violate Article 18 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the \u201cprivacy of correspondence of no citizen shall be infringed,\u201d as well as the students\u2019 unalienable rights to pursue happiness. The watchdog stressed that in the case of Kim\u2019s school, the majority of its students and their parents did not agree with the ban. According to a survey organized by school authorities about a month after the ban was introduced, 73 percent of students said the ban should be lifted, while 54.9 percent of parents thought the same. Still, the school did not revise its regulations against cellphones.\u201cThere are other ways to prevent car accidents caused by cellphone use, such as safety education,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unfortunate that the practice was implemented without the majority of the students\u2019 agreement. Such practice seems to violate the students\u2019 rights to pursue happiness, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, by limiting their opportunities to communicate freely with their family and friends on top of infringing their rights to independence and freedom.\u201dSouth Korea is one of the most wired countries it the world, with more than 80 percent of the entire population owning smartphones as of last year. A recent study by the nation\u2019s Gender Ministry showed that nearly 14 percent of Korean students are addicted to either a smartphone or the Internet. Some of the government\u2019s measures against smartphone addiction among teenagers include a rehab camp for young Internet or smartphone addicts, as well as therapy sessions with school counselors. Some schools, like Kim\u2019s, ban smartphone use altogether in classrooms.\u201cWe acknowledge that many worry about smartphone addiction among teenagers, but at the same time, cellphones can be seen as an (irreplaceable) medium that connects young people with one another, which prevents them from social isolation,\u201d the NKRCK said in a statement.Aside from Kim, students from two other high schools also filed complaints to the human rights agency last year, claiming their schools\u2019 ban on cellphone use is unfair. Both of the institutions are boarding schools that only allow students to use their cell phones on weekends. In one of the schools, 460 students currently have to share only four public phones, should they need to speak to someone outside the school on weekdays, and only with their teachers\u2019 approval, the human rights agency said. The school\u2019s authorities explained that allowing cell phone use may negatively affect student\u2019s dorm life, on top of their academic performance. \u201cMost students share their rooms with three other students, and when one of them plays with his or her phone at night when the light is turned off, it can decrease their roommates\u2019 quality of sleep.\u201d The authorities also claimed that students have \u201cno time to spend with their cell phones,\u201d due to their tight schedule. According to the report by the NKRCK, the students wake up at 6:30 a.m. every day, have breakfast at 7:30 and have classes from 8:30 a.m. until 9:30 p.m., before going to bed at 11 a.m. At the other school, students wake up at 6 a.m. and have classes from 7:30 a.m. until 8:50 p.m. They are required to study on their own from 9:30 p.m. until 1 a.m. before they go to sleep. The students only sleep five hours daily. Human rights violations in South Korea\u2019s education system have been frequently reported, such as bans on dating, wearing earrings and dying or perming hair, according to the teenager rights organization Group for Youth Sexuality Rights. The NKRCK advised both of the schools to ease their bans on cell phones. \u201cStudents attending boarding schools inevitably live away from their family members, and it\u2019s only natural for them to want to stay connected,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cWe conclude that it\u2019s almost impossible for 460 students to freely communicate with their loved ones if they only have four public phones to share between everyone. Their privacy may also be violated as they are required to get their teachers\u2019 approval should they want to use the public phones. We think this infringes on their right to pursue happiness.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com) Kim Ji-hoon is not his real name.

The bottom line is we take all missile launches seriously and consider these actions provocative in nature,\" Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency. \"We strongly condemn this and other North Korean missile launches in violation of U.N.

If confirmed, the launch would mark important progress in the North's missile program as re-entry technology has been considered one of the hardest parts the North must overcome before developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. (Yonhap)","747":"The White House vowed Wednesday to pursue additional pressure on North Korea, condemning the regime's latest test of the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile as a flagrant violation of its international obligations.\"The United States strongly condemns the provocative actions by the North Korean government that is a flagrant violation of their international obligations,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at a regular press briefing.\"The impact of these provocations will be to only strengthen the resolve of the international community that has such serious concerns with North Korea's behavior,\" he said. While working closely with South Korea and Japan, the U.S. will also \"continue our ongoing dialogue with the Chinese and the Russians about what additional pressure can be applied to the North Koreans,\" Earnest said.After the North's fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February, the U.S. has led the U.N. Security Council to adopt the toughest-ever sanctions on Pyongyang while adopting its own unilateral sanctions against the communist nation.Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department also designated the North as a \"primary money laundering concern,\" a powerful sanction designed to cut off the provocative regime from the international banking system for defiantly pursuing nuclear and missile development.The designation means banks around the world could be blacklisted if found to be doing business with Pyongyang. The measure was largely seen as targeting China as the North is believed to be conducting most transactions through the neighboring nation.\"Right now this is probably the most isolated country in the world. Their economy is suffering under withering economic sanctions that are not just imposed by the United States and our allies, Japan and South Korea but also have an impact, a significant impact on their economic relationship with countries like Russia and China,\" Earnest said.Abiding by international obligations is the only way for the North to get out of isolation, he said.\"The choice is theirs. It will be a choice that they'll have to make. Until that time, they're going to continue to be isolated. Their economy is going to suffer. And as a result of the decisions made by the North Korean government, unfortunately the people of North Korea will suffer,\" he said.State Department spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has \"at our disposal the ability to unilaterally hold DPRK accountable\" but did not elaborate.At a regular briefing, he also rejected criticism that sanctions don't work, saying it takes time to see the effects of sanctions.\"Obviously we're deeply concerned by these additional launches. That doesn't change the fact that the sanctions that were enacted by UNSCR 2270 are the toughest in two decades, but they're only three months old and sometimes it takes a period of time before you can start to see the affect of sanctions,\" he said, referring to the latest U.N. Security Council resolution.Sources said that the U.S could impose additional sanctions on the North over its human rights abuses.The North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, enacted in February, calls for the government to submit a specific report on Pyongyang's human rights abuses within 120 days. Under the law, the State Department could soon announce sanctions blacklisting about 10 North Korean officials for human rights violations, the sources said. But such designations are expected to be only symbolic as the North is already deeply isolated.

Choe Son-hui, deputy director for North American affairs at North Korea's foreign ministry and the North's deputy chief nuclear envoy, made the remarks during the closed-door forum, according to a diplomatic source who attended the forum.\"The six-party talks are dead,\" Choe was quoted as saying by the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the forum was not open to the public.It was not the first time that North Korea, which has conducted four nuclear tests since 2006, said the six-party talks were all but dead. Pyongyang has said the country's nuclear program is not a bargaining chip. However, the remarks by Choe further complicate diplomatic efforts by South Korea, the United States and China to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. During a question-and-answer session at the forum, Choe reaffirmed that North Korea will not give up its nuclear ambition. \"We could not give up our nuclear (weapons program), unless the world gives up nuclear (weapons),\" Choe was quoted as saying. Participants at the forum were \"frustrated\" by the North Korean envoy's remarks, the source said. Among those attending the Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue, which began its two-day run on Wednesday, are Ambassador Sung Kim, a top U.S. envoy on North Korea policy; Kim Gunn, South Korea's deputy chief nuclear envoy; and Wu Dawei, China's chief nuclear envoy.The forum opened hours before North Korea test-launched two intermediate-range ballistic missiles, in the North's latest violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology.The annual forum allows diplomats and scholars from six nations involved in the six-party talks -- South Korea, North Korea, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia -- to exchange views on how to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. During the forum, however, representatives from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan strongly criticized North Korea for launching the missiles, according to the source. The North Korean envoy did not make any remarks on the missile tests, the source said. \"This conference again displays a big gap between North Korea and the five nations over denuclearization of North Korea,\" the source said. Since its fourth nuclear test in January, North Korea has defied U.N. resolutions that ban the North from conducting missile tests using ballistic missile technology. South Korea's defense officials said the first launch on early Wednesday morning failed, but the second missile reached an attitude of about 1,000 kilometers and flew some 400 kilometers. If confirmed successful or partially successful, the second test would mark progress made in North Korea's development of mid-range Musudan missiles. Before the latest launch, Pyongyang had launched four Musudan missiles but all ended in failure.Responding to the North's missile tests, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, urged the \"relevant countries\"not to take action that could escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.","749":"On Tuesday afternoon, some 15 part-timers were sitting shoulder-to-shoulder on the pavement behind a poster reading \u201cFight for 10,000 won minimum wage\u201d at the entrance of the National Assembly in western Seoul.

Union members of Part-Time Workers\u2019 Union confront police officers on their way to a meeting with opposition lawmakers of The Minjoo Party, in front of the party\u2019s office in Yeouido, western Seoul, on June 9. They delivered their petition to demand the minimum wage of 10,000 won that day. YonhapPark and four other union members chose to fast in protest against what they see as the flawed system that sets the minimum wage in favor of employers and lawmakers\u2019 inaction to fulfil their election pledges to increase the wage. The hunger strike comes amid a fierce clash over the extent of the minimum wage hike between laborers and employers. Four rounds of negotiations on next year\u2019s rate have been held since April, with a plenary session scheduled on Thursday. Labor unions argue that the hike would curb the nation\u2019s income inequality, improve living conditions for low-income workers and revitalize the faltering domestic economy by boosting consumer spending. Business representatives, on the other hand, campaign for a freeze, citing soaring labor costs. They argue that the drastic hike could take a toll on small and medium-sized businesses that are already suffering from the economic downturn and will in return lead to loss of low-skilled jobs. According to the Korea Employers Federation, 87.6 percent of the laborers receiving the minimum wage are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises. The minimum wage has increased by 7.1 percent on average since 2013.They also call for adoption of a differentiated minimum wage by industrial sectors, regions, intensity of jobs and types of employment.\u00a0 Camping outside the parliament building, Park pointed out that the minimum wage of 10,000 won is not achievable under the current system of settling the rate, as it is heavily influenced by the government. \u201cIn order to reflect laborers\u2019 demands in the process and increase the wage, it takes political will. It should be decided at the National Assembly that represents people, not through the Minimum Wage Council,\u201d Park said. During April\u2019s parliamentary election, the ruling Saenuri Party said it would push for a hike to between 8,000 won and 9,000 won by 2020 when the parliamentary term expires, while the opposition bloc including the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea vowed to raise the wage to 10,000 won by 2020.The nation\u2019s minimum wage has been decided through the Minimum Wage Council since 1988. The council consists of 27 delegates \u2013 nine each from labor, management and public sector. As employers and employees wrangle over the minimum wage every year, the decision is usually left in the hands of the nine government-appointed delegates from the public sector.\u201cI worked part-time at a clothing store for six hours daily after school to earn only 600,000 won. There was no money left after I spent it on food and public transport,\u201d said Lee Ga-hyeon, a 24-year-old student, sitting under a black umbrella to keep the sun out. Since she graduated from high school, she has done seven other part-time jobs including waiting tables and selling merchandise. \u201cWith the way it is right now, I will never be able to improve my life. We are forced to hold several jobs because the hourly minimum wage is too low. We then are not able to focus on our studies.\u201d Lee said that she felt the irony when selling jewelry that she would never be able to afford, adding that she also felt helpless devastation.\u201cAt first I was just thankful that I could have a job and didn\u2019t know what to do when I received less than the minimum wage. ... I realized that I would never be able to live a better life unless the system changes.\u201dPolice attempted to take those on hunger strike\u00a0\u00a0to the police station every day for questioning on charges of holding an illegal assembly since they began the sit-in. Opposition lawmakers have shown interest in their protest, including Rep. Park Ju-min of The Minjoo Party, Lee Jeong-mi of the Justice Party as well as Goo Gyo-hyeon, the head of the Labor Party, who visited them in a show of support, the organization said.Other part-timers also joined the protest from a distance by refusing to eat for eight hours to amass a collective 10,000 hours of fasting. As of Wednesday, more than 130 people were involved in fasting some 5, 000 hours collectively. Despite the heavy rainfall expected in the coming days of the monsoon period, the protestors looked determined to continue the hunger strike. \u201cWe will hold a hunger strike despite the rain until the minimum wage is settled,\u201d the union head Park said.The council needs to submit the agreed minimum wage to the labor minister by June 28. The rate will be declared on Aug. 5 according to the minimum wage act.

It is a twin-engine medium-range aircraft capable of carrying 140 passengers. Meanwhile, the North's Air Koryo is known to be operating the Pyongyang-Shanghai route two times a week, according to VOA. The route was temporarily operated last summer but then stopped.In a related development, the North resumed flights between Pyongyang and Kuwait last month, after the route had been suspended in February. (Yonhap)","752":"North Korea has been unable to import luxury watches from Switzerland as the European country enforced tough sanctions on the reclusive country for its nuclear and long-range missile program, a U.S.-based media report said Wednesday.According to Radio Free Asia, North Korea's Swiss watch imports fell to zero in May, in sharp contrast to the monthly average of 20 watches from January through April this year. It said such a development will seriously affect leader Kim Jong-un's so-called \"gift politics,\" which has been a tool to exercise control over North Korea's elites.\u00a0Quoting the Swiss Watch Industry Association, RFA said North Korea bought a total of 87 watches in the first four months of 2016 worth $11,140.RFA said the North's halting of watch imports is a clear indication of the Swiss federal government's stern sanctions against Pyongyang. The reclusive country has unwaveringly pursued nuclear and missile programs despite warnings from the international community. The media forecast that the Swiss government's sanctions will squeeze the Pyongyang regime in other fields including finance. In early March, the U.N. Security Council adopted its toughest-ever sanctions, Resolution 2270, to punish the North's nuclear and missile tests in January and February, respectively. In response to the U.N.'s punitive action, the Swiss government in May placed 25 of its luxury items on the embargo list for the North. The items include caviar, wine, cigars, luxury wristwatches, ski and golf equipment and home appliances.As a consequence, RFA said, Kim is experiencing trouble giving gifts to loyalists. The leader is known for giving luxury items to his family members, senior officials of the party and the military to secure their allegiance. Kim's control is partly maintained by keeping the country's ruling class on his side.

Executive Order 13551 was designed to punish the North for sinking the South Korean warship Cheonan. Executive Order 13687 came in response to the North's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures and Executive Order 13722 came in response to the nuclear test.

High Commissioner for Refugees, while a total of 74 are being assisted by the UNHCR.The report did not specify the distribution of defectors per country. As the figure does not include defectors who have acquired permanent residence in other countries, the actual number of defectors is expected to be higher.The U.N. agency files the report each year based on statistics from each government, affiliated organizations and studies conducted on its own.The number of North Koreans defecting to the South -- which peaked at 2,706 in 2011 -- has been declining since Kim Jong-un rose to power there in 2012. It dropped from 1,502 in 2012 to 1,276 in 2015, which observers have attributed to economic improvement compared to the late 2000s and a reinforced crackdown by Pyongyang authorities on defectors and those condoning such acts.But the South Korean Unification Ministry last month said that 493 North Koreans came to the South from January to April, marking a 16.3 percent on-year increase from 424 in 2015.In April, 13 North Koreans who had worked at a China-based restaurant arrived in Seoul, followed by another group defection of three North Korean employees in May. Seoul government said that the U.N. Security Council sanctions -- imposed against Pyongyang after its Jan. 6 nuclear testing and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch -- may have affected the defectors\u2019 decision.But local liberal lawyers\u2019 group Minbyun raised questions on whether the defectors came to Korea of their own free will. The defectors\u2019 families in North Korea have claimed that the South kidnapped them. Conservative groups have lambasted such allegations, with ruling Saenuri\u2019s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk saying Tuesday that Minbyun is being used by the communist country.The UNHCR report also showed that global forced displacement has increased in 2015 to 65.3 million, marking a 5.8 million jump from the year before and an all-time high.Some 21.3 million were refugees while another 40.8 million were internally displaced. About 86 percent of the world\u2019s refugees were hosted by developing countries, the highest figure in more than two decades.The leading hosts were Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon, each at 2.5 million, 1.6 million and 1.1 million.An estimated 10 million were stateless in 2015, although the data garnered by the UNHCR was limited to only 3.7 million stateless individuals in 78 countries.During 2015, 201,400 refugees were returned to their countries of origin. Most were from Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia, respectively at 61,400, 39,500 and 32,300.Children unaccompanied by their guardians or separated from their families came to 98,400, the highest since the UNHCR started keeping records in 2006.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","755":"An estimated 1 million South Koreans have downloaded \"Pokemon Go,\" the popular augmented reality game not yet available in the country, an app analytics company said Saturday.\u00a0WiseApp said about 1.03 million people are estimated to have downloaded the Nintendo mobile game, which has quickly become a global sensation since its release last week.The company said the figure was reached based on a survey of 14,439 users of Android-based phones from July 7-15.

The annual Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue, which will begin its two-day run from Wednesday, brings together nuclear envoys from six nations involved in long-stalled talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Among those attending the forum are Choe Son-hui, deputy director for North American affairs at North Korea's foreign ministry and the North's deputy chief envoy for the six-party talks, and Ambassador Sung Kim, the top U.S. envoy on North Korea policy. Kim Gunn, South Korea's deputy chief nuclear envoy, also arrived in Beijing on Tuesday morning to attend the forum. Asked whether he would hold a bilateral meeting with Choe during the forum, Kim told reporters at the Beijing airport, \"I have no plans.\" Kim said, \"The prospects for resuming a dialogue with North Korea are low at this point,\" because the North shows no signs of giving up its nuclear ambitions. Organized by the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation of the University of California, San Diego, the NEACD has served as an opportunity for informal dialogue between North Korea and its nuclear negotiation partners -- South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. North Korea, which conducted its fourth nuclear test in January this year, did not attend the NEACD in 2014 and 2015.The six-party talks were last held in late 2008 and diplomatic efforts to resume the negotiations on ending North Korea's nuclear ambitions have produced little results, as the North showed no signs of giving up its nuclear weapons program.

Ji Sang-wuk. \u201cWe hope that the decision will become a starting point to overhaul the party.\u201d Although the independents had consistently publicized their wish to return to the party before and after the election, the party had been split among factions on whether to take them back. The defectors had mostly left the party after having failed to win their party nomination mainly due to factional competition or personal scandals.The contentious issue was settled by a secret vote of the party\u2019s emergency committee. The formal leadership is to be elected this August. Six of 11 committee members approved of the defectors\u2019 return. The fate of the defectors has roiled the ruling party since its crushing election defeat in April.At the center of the debate was Yoo, who left his post after clashing with President Park, who denounced him for \u201cbetraying\u201d her.

Park Hae-mook\/The Korea Herald\u201c(Political circles) should break free from their narrow visions based on power relations and create a constitution that may embrace the social changes during the past 30 years and suggest a direction for the nation\u2019s future,\u201d Chung said.He thereby pledged to \u201cwrap up\u201d the issue within the 20th parliamentary term, which is to end in May 2020.Chung\u2019s resolution fueled the years-long suggestion that the 30-year basic law fails to establish the power division frame required in a modern democratic society.South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Law was last revised in the wake of the June 10 Democratization Uprising to adopt a direct election system and to reinstate the authority of the parliament.Despite what it achieved back then, the basic law has also been blamed for granting excessive power to the president and limiting that of the legislature, thus intensifying the state power imbalance.Chung, whose affiliation to The Minjoo Party of Korea has been temporarily held off due to his position, is not the first parliamentary speaker to address constitutional revision.His conservative predecessors Chung Ui-hwa, Kang Chang-hee and Kim Hyung-o have also raised the issue during their respective terms, but the debate was always overshadowed by other urgent issues such as economic revitalization and elections.Changes, however, have recently been detected, not only in general public sentiment and the liberal opposition circles, but also in parts of the ruling conservative Saenuri camp.A number of influential politicians, including Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil, have been advocating the revision. Rep. Chong Jong-sup, a Saenuri lawmaker elected in Daegu and a former professor of constitutional law at Seoul National University, also urged for a consensus on the issue within this year.Their stance resonated with the recent public sentiment as shown in the public survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, in which 69.8 percent of respondents said that they approved of constitutional revision.However, parties still stand at odds over the details of power restructuring.Saenuri members supporting the revision tend to prefer a semi-presidential system, in which the president acts as head of state and a parliament-elected prime minister steers domestic state affairs. The system, which places focus on the diplomatic capacity of the president, is expected to be to the advantage of U.N. Secretary-General and former Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon in making his bid in the 2017 presidential election.The opposition camp, led by the Minjoo Party, is divided between the semi-presidential system and a parliamentary system. The latter empowers the legislature to name a prime minister as chief of the executive branch.Woo Yoon-keun, the incoming parliamentary secretary-general and close aide to Speaker Chung, suggested a referendum during the April by-election next year, asking for the public response on the revision.While the runner-up opposition People\u2019s Party refrained from stating its stance, floor leader Rep.

(Yonhap)","774":"North Korea's trade volume sank 18 percent last year from a year earlier, ending five years of straight growth, due largely to a drop in the prices of its key trading items such as coal and overall shipments, a South Korean trade agency said Wednesday.The North's overall trade volume came to $6.25 billion in 2015, compared with $7.61 billion the previous year, according to the state-run Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency.The reclusive country's outbound shipments fell 15 percent on-year to reach $2.7 billion, while imports also dropped 30 percent to $3.55 billion over the cited period, the data compiled by the agency showed.Consequently, the communist state's trade deficit reached $850 million last year, narrowing 33 percent from the previous year.The North's trade volume has been on a rising path since 2009 reaching an all-time high of $7.61 billion in 2014.But a drop in prices of key trade items such as coal, coupled with a slowdown in China -- its strongest ally -- led to a decline in overall trade volume, KOTRA said.Bilateral trade volume between North Korea and China came to $5.71 billion last year, down 16.8 percent from a year earlier.The figure accounted for 91.3 percent of the North's overall trade in 2015, slightly higher than the previous year's 90.1 percent.North Korea's dependence on China for trade has been increasing steadily since 2005 when its trade volume with China exceeded 50 percent of its overall trade.Russia, another North Korean ally, was the country's second-largest trading partner in 2015, with bilateral trade volume reaching $84 million, followed by India with $77 million and Thailand with $50 million.The North's largest export item was fuel such as coal, the shipments of which dropped 8.1 percent to $1.08 billion. The item accounted for 40.2 percent of its overall exports, the data showed.Exports of clothing rose 5.5 percent on-year to $800 million, with its portion in the North's entire export rising to 29.7 percent from 24.1 percent in 2014.

(Yonhap)","776":"Prosecutors signaled a full-fledged crackdown on South Korea\u2019s fifth-largest conglomerate and retail giant Lotte Group last week with extensive raids, in an apparent move to trace the financial malpractices of its current top executives.The intense probe, coming in the penultimate year of the incumbent presidency, has widely kindled speculation of eventually targeting the previous administration and its links to the feud-ridden conglomerate.Last Friday, Lotte Group was turned upside down as some 240 investigators from the Seoul Central Prosecutors\u2019 Office raided its key business locations, including the group\u2019s headquarters in central Seoul and the personal residence of its chairman Shin Dong-bin.The notable raids were rooted in the allegations that group founder Shin Kyuk-ho and his two sons Dong-joo and Dong-bin were accountable for amassing some 300 billion won ($255 million) in slush funds through embezzlement.Lotte Group`s headquarters in central Seoul (The Korea Herald)Prosecutors also gestured at looking into the group\u2019s overseas monetary transactions, focusing on the accusation that it has been paying out most of its profits to shareholding Japanese entities -- a phenomenon often described by the local media as \u201coutflow of national wealth.\u201dAccording to the Fair Trade Commission, the group\u2019s de facto holding company Lotte Hotel paid 121.3 billion won in 2011-2015 in dividends to its Japanese entity stakeholders, which account for 99.28 percent of total shares.Soon, the focus stretched to whether the ultimate target of the probe was to dig into the possibilities of influence-peddling over the permission for construction by the President Lee Myung-bak administration of the group\u2019s much-disputed landmark building in southern Seoul, although officials have denied the notion thus far.\u201cWe are aware that people take a keen interest in the issue, but for various circumstances, Lotte World Tower is not subject to immediate prosecutorial probe,\u201d said an official of the central prosecutor\u2019s office Monday.Despite such denial, however, observers point out that it may be likely for the incumbent Park Geun-hye administration to level gunpoint at the former Lee administration by using Lotte Group as the connecting factor.The 123-story skyscraper in Jamsil has been at the heart of public dispute, partly for a number of fatal safety accidents during construction and also for the extent of the former administration allegedly having bent the rules to greenlight the construction of East Asia\u2019s tallest building.The construction project, said to be the lifelong ambition of group founder Shin, had been dismissed under the three administrations preceding Lee\u2019s, mainly due to concerns on Air Force planes\u2019 safety.But as soon as Lee, formerly chief of Hyundai Engineering & Construction, took office in 2008, the long-thwarted plan suddenly picked up momentum, finally breaking ground in 2010.In order to avoid risks of air clashes, the Air Force\u2019s Seoul Air Base in Seongnam, located 5.5 kilometers south of the disputed high-rise, had to shift its runways slightly.On Tuesday, investigators reportedly uncovered a money trail leading from Lotte Group to a retired Air Force lieutenant general who served as the deputy chief of staff, with suspicion of the conglomerate having handed 1.2 billion won to a construction firm headed by the retired general in 2008.\u00a0The fact that Lotte Group marked exponential growth during Lee\u2019s five-year term further boosted suspicions on under-the-table contacts. The conglomerate not only inked 26 cases of mergers and acquisitions during that time, but also stepped into the beverage market and won a monopolistic status in the duty-free shop sector. Its total assets more than doubled, from 40 trillion won in 2007 to 84 trillion in 2012.Adding fuel to the political scenario is the prosecution\u2019s previous practices of kicking off irregularity charges against former powers and their aides, especially when the incumbent president is in trouble.The most conspicuous and tragic example was a corruption probe in 2009, Lee\u2019s second year in office, on his predecessor President Roh Moo-hyun.The issue was raised while Lee\u2018s approval ratings had crashed to a record low in the aftermath of the U.S. beef import dispute the previous year. The pressing investigation included the first-ever summoning of a former president for prosecutorial questioning. Roh committed suicide on May 23, 2009 in the midst of the escalating investigation.Defensive of public criticism, some prosecutors claimed that such charges against faded powers should be seen as justice delayed, rather than a back-scratching alliance with the current power.\u201cIt is highly difficult to obtain information on crimes involving incumbent powers,\u201d Kim Hong-il, former chief prosecutor in Busan and currently senior lawyer at Shin & Kim, said in an academic forum held at Lotte Hotel Busan in April.But once the administration changes, evidence of past crimes tends to make an appearance, which is when authorities gear up for investigation, he explained.\u201cBecause of the time gap (between the irregularity and the consequent probe), the prosecution is often blamed for chasing after \u2018dead powers\u2019 like hyenas, but one should accept the reality to a certain extent.\u201dObservers thus predicted that Lotte\u2019s alleged affiliation with the former Lee government will eventually rise to the surface.\u201cThe (lobbying allegations concerning) Lotte World Tower is quite likely to rise as a probe agenda, sometime or another,\u201d said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebol.com, a local research company on South Korea\u2019s conglomerates.\u201cIf so, the issue will deliver a considerable impact on the political circles.\u201dSome, especially those in opposition political parties, suggested that the prosecution\u2019s full-fledged probe on Lotte may be a diversion from the recent set of scandals involving high-ranking former prosecutors.Among them is former chief prosecutor Choi Yoo-jeong, who was arrested last month on charges of taking kickbacks and influencing the rulings of clients, including cosmetics firm CEO Jung Woon-ho. Hong Man-pyo, a former star prosecutor, was charged with intervening for the court verdicts of his clients in exchange for astronomical fees.\u201cThe probe should be implemented thoroughly, but an attempt to turn public attention away from legal scandals may never be tolerated,\u201d said The Minjoo Party of Korea in a written statement.By Bae Hyun-jung\u00a0 (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","777":"Police said Tuesday they have arrested a South Korean high school student, who follows the international hacktivist group Anonymous, on charges of hacking some thousands of domestic and foreign websites since last year.The 16-year-old, whose identity was withheld, is suspected of defacing a total of 3,847 websites from 87 countries between April 2015 and April of this year, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

Lee Ju-young participated. Calls have been lingering for revising the constitution, which was last amended in 1987 following a massive pro-democracy movement to end the decades of rule by military-backed authoritarian governments. The proponents of the revision have argued that the current constitution does not reflect the social and political changes that have taken place since the last revision nearly three decades ago. Some of them, in particular, have called for a shift in the current governance structure, where power is concentrated too much on the chief executive, and asserted the need to adopt a four-year, double-term presidency to have a more stable, farsighted policy implementation.During the seminar, Rep. Lee expressed hopes that a constitutional amendment can happen before next year's presidential election.\"We have one and a half years before the presidential election,\" he said during his congratulatory remarks. \"I have this expectation that if we push for the revision during this period of time and call for a national referendum, we can achieve a history of constitutional revision.\"The seminar was arranged by an association of some six non-governmental organizations including the Hansun Foundation led by former Finance Minister Bahk Jae-wan.The government has so far held a cautious stance over the constitutional revision as it could trigger yet another partisan wrangling, which could derail its efforts to maintain political stability and focus on enhancing people's livelihoods. But some of the ruling party members, including Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, have raised the issue.

Recent reports have suggested that a new pin bearing the image of the current leader Kim Jong-un has been added.The source said, however, that it is not yet known why the North Koreans are not wearing their loyalty badges. But the North Korean who are responsible for the management of the North Korean employees in the hotel have been seen sporting the lapel pin of the late leaders.Another source said other North Koreans working in China still wear the badges, though they do not wear it when on outing.The source then said that North Korean laborers as well as those responsible for North Koreans working at sewing factories in Dandong, a border city with North Korea, have opted not to wear the ubiquitous badge on their lapel. The source speculated that the move may be an attempt to conceal the fact that they are North Koreans. The badge is a sign of respect and loyalty and is viewed as part of the personality cult being built around the current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un who took the country's power after his father Kim Jong-il's death in 2011.

In Seoul, 6,925 domestic abuses cases were reported, a 52.4 percent rise from a year prior.\u00a0As of May, police have been monitoring 12,000 families with previous reports of domestic violence. During the first five months of this year, police cracked down on 18,585 cases.(123rf)The police said the surge in the number of domestic violence cases is a result of the creation of teams of investigators specializing in crimes against women and children. The teams were created last February in light of a series of brutal child abuse cases that led to the deaths of children in the hands of their abusive parents.According to a 2014 survey by the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations on 93 domestic abusers, 82.4 percent of the offenders were men, while 17.2 percent were women. Most of the cases were violence between couples, with 69.9 percent of the physical abuse having been committed by men against women. Nearly 35 percent of the crimes occurred due to differences in their personalities, followed by intake of alcohol at 19.2 percent and mistrust between couples at 18 percent.A survey by the Gender Ministry has shown that the majority of domestic violence cases still tend to remain unreported. According to the poll on domestic violence conducted every three years, only 1.8 percent of abuse cases were reported to police in 2013.\u00a0Police currently monitor families in danger of being exposed to domestic violence by dividing them into two groups.Group A are households in which the family member experienced at least two occasions of domestic violence within the past three years, or at least three reports to the police within the past year. They also include those that have been slapped with an injunction. Police have been paying such families a visit or calling them once a month.Group B are those who have suffered from domestic violence at least once within the past three years with at least two occasions of a family member reporting to police within the past year. The monitoring for Group B families is conducted once every two months.As of May, 4,294 Korean families (excluding those on Jejudo Island) belong to Group A, and 7,940 families to Group B.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","784":"A South Korean presidential panel said Monday it has requested the country's law enforcement authorities to punish a local radiographic inspection firm for violating a law on nuclear safety.An employee at the firm's subcontractor was exposed to radiation in December while conducting a nondestructive radiation test alone at a chemical factory construction site in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, according to the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission.The man in his 20s, identified only by his surname Yang, began work at the subcontractor just a month prior. Carrying no radiation measuring instrument at the time of the incident, his hands were exposed to radiation.The firm did not inform the NSSC of the case, attempting to cover it up, said the panel. The nation's law on atomic power safety calls for an immediate report of any trouble associated with radiation to the commission.The incident was disclosed belatedly after a tip-off to the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety under the commission.The company was also found to have breached the rule requiring at least two workers to work together in a team for such radiation test work.The NSSC held a meeting on the matter on May 26 and decided to bring it to prosecutors. The head of the company and three other senior officials will face a formal investigation.Many South Koreans are already upset by the death of a 19-year-old worker in a May accident attributable to poor safety measures by a subcontractor with Seoul Metro, a subway operator here.

The meeting also comes less than two weeks after the two ministers held talks on the sidelines of the regional Shangri-La Dialogue held in early June in Singapore.In the past talks, they agreed to step up joint efforts to ensure the full implementation of international sanctions on North Korea.Joint South Korea-France actions on international peacekeeping operations and cyberspace security will also be on the table, the ministry said. \"France is a partner that shares core values with us on the issues involving the Korean Peninsula and the globe,\" a ministry official said. \"Han's France visit will provide a foothold for solidifying strategic defense cooperation between the countries.\" The last France visit by a South Korean defense ministry was December 2007 by former Defense Minister Kim Jang-soo.During the upcoming visit, Han plans to visit a monument marking the sacrifice of French soldiers sent to the 1950-53 Korean War and deliver a speech to students of France's military academies.\u00a0 \"France is South Korea's long-time friend country with this year marking 130 years of diplomatic relations,\" the official said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","786":"The ruling Saenuri Party said Monday that it would hold a national convention on Aug. 9 to elect a new leadership, which will replace the current interim arrangement launched in the wake of the party's crushing defeat in the April parliamentary polls.Currently, the party is led by the so-called emergency planning and innovation committee tasked with reorganizing the party and shoring up public support, which has waned in the wake of the factional rift and high-profile infighting.The committee is led by Kim Hee-ok, the former head of the Government Public Ethics Committee.

Ahn Cheol-soo of the People\u2019s Party already finds himself trapped between a nose-diving party approval rating and an illicit fund probe concerning some of his closest aides.Whether or not he succeeds in pulling the fledgling centrist opposition party out of the current trials will also act as a leadership barometer, judging his qualifications for the 2017 presidential election, in which he is expected to make a bid. (Yonhap)\u201cRegardless of what happened, I am sorry to cause anxiety to the people,\u201d Ahn said Friday over the ongoing allegations that one of the party\u2019s proportional representatives took illicit funds during the April 13 general election campaigns.This was a compromising turn from his stout response the previous day, in which he said that \u201cthe given allegations are not true.\u201dThe National Election Commission on Thursday had reported Rep. Kim Su-min to the prosecution, charging her with taking up to hundreds of millions of won in political funds earlier this year.According to the election watchdog, two local advertisement companies in charge of the party\u2018s campaign promotion transferred 238.2 million won ($203,000) to an account owned by a hotel that Kim used to run, but the detailed use of the money remained unclear.The lawmaker denied the given charges, but has so far refrained from explaining any further.Amid growing public reproach, Ahn quickly promised to establish an internal investigation team to look into the claims, in a preemptive attempt to eradicate the controversy once and for all.\u201cWe will look into every detail, including on Kim\u2019s proportional representative nomination, and disclose everything to the people,\u201d he told reporters Saturday.The greatest dilemma for the runner-up opposition party, which has been built on the promise of \u201cnew politics,\u201d is that one of its core founding members is involved in the dishonorable charge.One of the allegations is that the political novice Kim, who also happens to be the youngest member of the new legislature, had acted under the direction of party leadership, especially then-secretary general Rep. Park Sun-sook, and thus won herself the nomination for the proportional representation.The fact that Kim had not even asked for the position further boosted suspicion that party leadership -- possibly Rep. Ahn himself -- may have been involved. The beleaguered party chief turned out to have interviewed Kim in a closed-door session, shortly before the party kicked off its proportional representative nomination committee.The illicit fund probe came at a time when the No. 3 party\u2018s approval rating was faltering upon the swift rise of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as a potential presidential candidate speaking for the ruling conservative Saenuri Party.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea on June 7-9 of 1,002 voters here, the support rate for Ahn stood at 10 percent. He thus fell to No. 3 behind Ban, who accounted for 26 percent, and The Minjoo Party of Korea\u2019s former chief Moon Jae-in, who won 16 percent.Observers noted that a large number of reformist swing votes flocked from Ahn to Ban, preferring his reputed career as reelected chief of the international organization.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","788":"A 26-year-old man was booked without detention for allegedly distributing over 12,000 cartoons of child pornography on the Internet, the Incheon Gyeyang police said Thursday.

The move -- considered bold in the country notorious for long working hours -- was met with mixed reactions. South Korea\u2019s average yearly working hours reached 2,285 in 2015, the longest of any OECD member.Unlike private companies and government agencies, there was no rule governing working hours for lawmakers. \u201cI think we can work more efficiently by separating when to work and when to take a break,\u201d Pyo said.

He joined politics last year and won a seat in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.The 50-year-old said that his aides and staff were often forced to work overtime to respond to calls from ordinary citizens and reporters. Those working at other lawmakers\u2019 offices said that the former police officer\u2019s celebrity status tended to attract more calls than the other first-term lawmakers.

The analysis found no reference to the communist state as a nuclear power contrary to widespread expectation.The set of party bylaws, which is regarded as being superior to the Constitution in the party-centric state, was amended during the 7th party congress last month, in what analysts said was a move to further strengthen North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's grip on power.Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University, noted that Pyongyang might have signaled its intention to engage in negotiations over its nuclear program amid its deepening isolation stemming from its nuclear and missile provocations.\"If North Korea had stated itself as a nuclear power in the bylaws, this would have posed a great impediment to its efforts to hold talks and negotiations with the United States (over its nuclear program),\" he said.Pyongyang has already claimed itself to be a nuclear power in its Constitution. During the May party congress, the reclusive state went further to portray itself as a \"responsible\" nuclear state, saying that it will \"permanently\" defend its policy of simultaneously pursuing economic development and nuclear armament.All these moves have been seen as an indication of Pyongyang's unwillingness to bargain away its nuclear arms despite its pressing need to break out of international isolation and shore up its debilitated economy.Observers have argued that with Pyongyang having conducted four nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013 and this year, it would seek negotiations over a nuclear arms reduction rather than denuclearization.In the revised document of party regulations, the North described its current leader as a \"great leader,\" bringing the status of the 30-something strongman closer to that of his two late predecessors: national founder Kim Il-song and former leader Kim Jong-il. Kim Il-song is the current leader\u2019s grandfather, while Kim Jong-il is his father.The North calls Kim's predecessors \"eternal leader\" and \"eternal head,\" respectively.The document also said that citizens age 18 or older can join the party and are obliged to offer it 2 percent of their monthly income, and that party membership can be canceled when a member opposes the party's policy, engages in any factional activity or inflicts \"grave\" damage on the party.The set of rules, in addition, defined the ruling party as one rooted in the ideological principles of Kim's two predecessors, in an apparent move to justify the long-standing hereditary rule by the Kim family.

The defense budget for this year stands at 38.8 trillion won. The budget increase reflects welfare plans to hike the salary of military conscripts by 10 percent and to expand psychological counseling services for the conscripts, the statement said. The 2017 budget plan also includes a fund of 1.6 trillion won to be spent in the on-going long-haul drive to build an indigenous air defense system.

But of course, speaking broadly about the issue, we're concerned that North Korea could have access to materials that would allow it to produce nuclear weapons, more nuclear weapons,\" he said at a regular press briefing.Earlier this week, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano said there are indications that the North could have started nuclear reprocessing. Private U.S. research institutes, citing commercial satellite imagery, have also reported signs of the North running or preparing to run the reprocessing plant, such as smoke from a coal-fired plant providing steam for reprocessing activity.The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods that, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make at least one bomb a year.The reactor has provided Pyongyang with weapons-grade plutonium that the regime used in its first three nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

Chinese President Xi Jinping met Ri in an apparent bid to mend political ties that were strained by North Korea's nuclear weapons ambition. Citing a conversation with Wu, Kim said, \"When Ri Su-yong visited China, the Chinese side made clear its stance on the Korean Peninsula, including denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" Wu also told Kim that China is committed to fully enforcing U.N. sanctions against North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. \"The Chinese side voiced its strong opposition to North Korea's additional provocations, including more nuclear and missile tests,\" Kim said.North Korea has been slapped with tougher U.N. sanctions following its fourth nuclear test in January.Wrapping up high-level talks with Chinese counterparts on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Beijing that China is determined to \"fully enforce\" U.N. sanctions against North Korea. The meeting between Kim and Wu comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency warned earlier this week that North Korea appears to have restarted its main nuclear bomb fuel plant. If the warning by the IAEA is correct, it would be the latest move by North Korea in expanding its nuclear weapons program, despite tightened international sanctions. Kim said South Korea and the U.S. are closely monitoring the warning by the IAEA on North Korea's nuclear activities with \"grave concern.\" However, there was no discussion about the apparent restart of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to produce plutonium at the Yongbyon nuclear complex during Wednesday's talks with Wu, Kim said.

Those who do not turn in the list by the end of this month could be fined up to 10 million won ($8,660).\u201cThis is just the beginning for the ministry to ensure the safety of household products, and we will complete a survey on all such products by the end of this year and expand into all biocide-containing industrial and electronic goods from next year,\u201d said Vice Environment Minister Jeong Yeon-man.Vice Environment Minister Jeong Yeon-man (left) attends a meeting with the toxic humidifier disinfectant victims in Seoul on June 7.

The index was developed by the World Health Organization to evaluate the level of drinking habit. The AUDIT score of stressed-out single women was 6.9 points, which was 1.25 points higher than those who felt less stress.The score of those with depression was 7.81 points, which was about 2 points higher than those with no depression. The score is determined based on the frequency and amount of drinking as well as self-control ability. People with an AUDIT score of over 8 are considered to have a problematic drinking habit. \u201cThe survey showed that single women not only have higher stress or depression but also tend to cope with their mental problems by drinking,\u201d said researcher Kim Hyo-jung who participated in the study.\u201cDrinking can negatively impacted their health, including pregnancy.\u201dAnother survey in 2014 by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs had shown that the high-risk drinking rate -- drinking at least five glasses of alcohol a day, more than twice a week -- had surged to 6 percent in 2012 from 3.4 percent in 2005 among women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.Experts have noted the higher risk of alcohol dependency among women who choose to drink alone to evade societal prejudice against women who drink.The study was published in the latest issue of Perspectives in Nursing Science, a journal published by Seoul National University Research Institute of Nursing Science. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","801":"South Korean police said Wednesday that North Korea was behind three separate cyberattacks carried out earlier this year, claiming the reclusive country sent a large number of malware-tainted emails by disguising the senders.Between January and February, North Korea sent a large number of emails to South Koreans, including local journalists, defectors and North Korea experts, said the National Police Agency, wrapping up their months-long investigation.In late January, a link to a video clip, edited as if South Korean President Park Geun-hye was supporting the North's nuclear development, was distributed to 38,988 people. Police said the emails, which were disguised as if they were sent from local broadcasters, seem to be part of a propaganda campaign by the North.In the following month, more emails, pretending to be from a police officer, were sent to 48 people, including North Korean defectors and Pyongyang experts, asking for cooperation in the investigation of the fake video clip. Police said the emails contained viruses that could have infected the recipients' computers. In mid-January, a third email pretending to be from a South Korean expert on Pyongyang was sent to 83 people, including several local reporters.No damage has yet been reported due to this series of cyberattacks, the NPA said. Police said checking the Internet Protocol address -- the online equivalent of a street address -- showed all the messages coming from North Korea's capital city.\"Following the recent sanctions imposed on North Korea by the U.N. Security Council, it is likely that the North will continue to distribute malware through emails,\" a police officer said, urging citizens and organizations to be cautious.North Korea has a track record of waging cyberattacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has consistently denied any involvement.

Stoeger attended a ceremony at the ministry marking the bestowal of citizenship, but Pissar was not able to do so for health reasons. During the ceremony, they also received a medal of citizenship and a Korean folding screen decorated with a depiction of the \"Sipjangsaeng,\" or ten longevities.South Korea awards honorary citizenship to a foreigner who made outstanding and meritorious contributions to enhancing the country's prestige and interests.It marks the second time for a foreigner to be made an honorary South Korean citizen since Hiddink, the Dutch head coach of the Korean national soccer team, received honorary South Korean citizenship in 2002.The bestowal of an honorary citizenship certificate does not warrant any legal rights and duties. But the ministry plans to provide them with administrative conveniences such as quick entry and exit through immigration checkpoints and the immediate provision of permanent resident status.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said, \"I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to them for the sacrifices they made for people with leprosy for about 40 years.\"After graduating from the nursing college of the University of Innsbruck, the two women came to the island in 1962 and 1966, separately, upon hearing that the colony was in need of nurses.They resided on the island for more than 40 years to work at the National Sorok Island Hospital before returning to their home country in 2005.Despite their long years of duty, the two, often called \"the Angels of Sorok Island,\" did not receive any remuneration for their service and only devoted themselves to caring for leprosy-stricken patients and improving their welfare.The government presented them with medals in 1972, 1983 and 1996 for their contributions to the country. The Sorok colony was founded on the small island in 1916 during Japan's colonial rule of Korea (1910-1945), as they attempted to quarantine patients with leprosy. Infected people were rounded up and taken to the island for isolation and treatment. The South Korean government forced them to remain there until 1963, nearly two decades after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Hundreds of people who suffered from the disease still reside on the island, even after having been cured.

The service provider publishes its \"State of the Internet\" report each quarter.\u00a0 The Akamai survey said the next fastest internet speed country after South Korea is Sweden with 19.1 Mbps, trailed by Norway with 18.8 Mbps and Japan with 17.4 Mbps.China's internet speed is measured at 4.1 Mbps, slower than the global average of 5.6 Mbps, but still double the speed of North Korea.The report also said that other countries with lower internet speed than North Korea are Cuba, Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia, Nepal and some African and Middle East countries. (Yonhap)","804":"After a days-long stalemate, South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party announced Wednesday that it will allow the main opposition to appoint the new National Assembly speaker, which will allow 20th National Assembly to start work in earnest.The announcement made by Saenuri's floor leader Chung Jin-suk opens the door for the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea to designate the new National Assembly speaker. The deadlock on who will sit in the speaker's chair has stalled all parliamentary proceedings such as picking who will chair the 18 assembly committees. The ruling party, however, said it should take the chairmanships of the key steering and legislation committees in return.Saenuri also has been eying the intelligence committees within the National Assembly, while Minjoo wants to chair the steering and national policy committees.Rep. Suh Chung-won, an eight-term lawmaker from Saenuri who has been cited as a potential candidate for the National Assembly speaker, called on his party to look at the bigger picture and asked Saenuri's leadership to yield the speaker's seat to the opposition.Chung then brushed aside speculations raised by the opposition that the presidential office has been behind the ruling party's strategy on the parliamentary formation. The Saenuri whip added it also plans to yield the budget, policy, and finance committees' chairmanships to the opposition.Minjoo greeted the latest decision, adding that the move reflects the public's will as shown through April's poll. The main opposition added it will make effort to move forward on other issues related to the appointment of assembly committee chairs. The ruling Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party have been wrangling over the formation of the committees as the main opposition managed to take one more seat in the 300-seat unicameral parliament following the April 13 polls.The discussion had faced a deadlock as Saenuri claimed it should take the National Assembly speaker seat, in line with tradition, since the post has with very few exceptions been taken up by the ruling party in the past. The opposition countered that the No. 1 party in terms of the number of lawmakers has priority in picking the speaker.Political pundits earlier said if the parties do not agree on the issue soon, the 20th National Assembly will get off to a rocky start, which bodes ill for cooperation between the parties down the road.

The two Koreas still remain technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.The industrial complex, which opened in 2004, served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has benefited from cheap but skilled North Korean labor.But Seoul ended the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation over concerns that the money generated from the complex might bankroll North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.In March, North Korea countered that it will nullify all cross-border agreements on economic cooperation arrangements and liquidate South Korean assets in retaliation for Seoul's move to impose unilateral sanctions.South Korea unveiled a set of punitive actions including banning the entry of vessels that have made a port call in the North and blacklisting key North Korean officials and entities. (Yonhap)","806":"A North Korean fishing vessel was sent back home after it accidentally crossed the inter-Korean sea border early Wednesday, South Korea's military said.The vessel was reported by a South Korean fishing boat around 3:40 a.m. some 21 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime border, in the East Sea, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\"A Navy ship was dispatched to the scene to search the boat, and found it had a problem with its navigation and (the crew) had no intention to defect to South Korea,\" the JCS said. After verification, the North Korean boat and its crew were expelled to the North Korean side at around 7:10 a.m., it said. \"Our military is maintaining a high level of combat readiness and keeping close tabs on North Korean activities,\u201d the JCS said.In late May, two North Korean vessels had crossed the NLL in the Yellow Sea in what South Korean officials said was a test of Seoul's military's defense posture there.At that time, the Navy fired five warning shots to notify them they were trespassing and to send them back north of the NLL. North Korea occasionally sends its vessels south of the NLL, which they do not accept as an official sea border since the demarcation line was drawn up by the United Nations Command after the 1950-53 Korean War. (Yonhap)","807":"The U.S. Treasury Department has frozen more than $40,000 held by blacklisted North Korean officials in recent years, South Korean officials said Tuesday, in the latest sign of pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program.The Treasury Department froze $40,800 in a total of nine cases from May 2014 to April 2015, the officials said. The U.S.authorities found out the North Korean funds, which were exposed as financial transactions involving U.S. dollars going through the U.S. financial system.The U.S. reportedly spent about $432,000 in tracing and freezing the North Korean funds.The news came just days after the Treasury Department designated North Korea as a \"primary money laundering concern\" to cut off Pyongyang from the international banking system for its nuclear and missile programs.The designation came as part of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act enacted in February to punish the North for conducting its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month in violation of U.N. resolutions. (Yonhap)","808":"North Korea pledged Tuesday to develop more nuclear weapons as its existing arsenal has helped raise the country's strategic leverage in dealing with external relations, the North's state media said.North Korea plans to actively pursue diplomatic policy commensurate with its enhanced global status which has been earned thanks to its nuclear weapons program, according to Rodong Sinmun, the North's main newspaper.The country has conducted four nuclear tests since 2006 with outside observers believing the North has a small stockpile of nuclear weapons.\"We will produce more modern and diverse nuclear weapons,\" the newspaper said. \"The weapons are not aimed at posing a threat to peace. We will not use nuclear weapons if aggressors do not attack us with nukes,\" it said.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has referred to his country as a \"responsible\" nuclear state at the congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea held in early May.Kim made it clear that he will \"permanently\" defend the pursuit of his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy.The North claims that it has succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, but Seoul and Washington said that Pyongyang's miniaturization technology has not been fully achieved.The newspaper report came as North Korea is engaged in a flurry of diplomacy apparently to drive a wedge in united fronts for imposing sanctions over the communist country's nuclear test and long-range rocket launch early this year.Ri Su-yong, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party, made a rare visit to China last week in an apparent bid to improve strained ties with Beijing following Pyongyang's nuclear tests.North Korea's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, also visited Equatorial Guinea last month to attend the inauguration ceremony of the president of the African country. (Yonhap)","809":"Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon is on the hot seat amid escalating criticism over his governing ability with regard to the recent deadly safety accident and prolonged conflicts with civic activists concerning city affairs. Park has 1 1\/2 years left in his second term.During a press briefing Tuesday, Park said that safety measures discussed in the past had mostly not considered the real conditions at work sites and had been \u201cempty talk.\u201dHe added, \u201cI will stop blaming the past and continue to think about how to build a safe system with thorough investigation.\u201d Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon speaks during a press conference on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The conference was held following the death of a 19-year-old subway mechanic on May 28 while repairing a screen door at a Seoul subway station. The death had sparked outcry against the \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of irregular workers.Despite Mayor Park\u2019s promise to amend the situation, public criticism continued and news reports accused Seoul Metro, operator of the subway lines, of a bureaucratic operation with executive members who were closely associated with Park. More than 40 percent of employees at Eunsung PSD, a company that had been subcontracted by subway operator Seoul Metro for screen door maintenance, were found to be the former staff of Seoul Metro. Kim was hired as a subcontractor for Ensung PSD.According to a payroll sheet by Eunsung PSD in 2015, a total of 38 former Seoul Metro staff had received an extra 90 million won in \u201cwelfare costs.\u201dThe revelation has sparked heated debate over the current operation of the city subway lines and even led to the coining of the word \u201cMefia,\u201d -- a combination of \u201cMetro\u201d and \u201cmafia.\u201dFollowing the fatal accident, about 180 executive officials of Seoul Metro on Sunday turned in their resignations.But the public still voiced concern over whether the organizational reshuffle of the company would fundamentally resolve the deep-rooted personnel practice and unfair working environment of employees at subcontracted companies. Others also called it mending the gate after the horse has bolted, pointing out that Kim\u2019s death was the third fatal accident of its kind to occur since 2013. Faced with criticism toward the revolving-door employment system that secures stable positions for retired city officials while neglecting the working environment of less well-paid workers, Mayor Park said during Tuesday\u2019s briefing that he would immediately delete the contract clauses which give Seoul Metro staff an advantage in being hired at subcontractor companies. The city will also run a direct company that handles the subway safety management system, he added.Park, who has often been dubbed as the likely presidential candidate for the opposition, has continuously underlined that he has a deep belief in the value of communication. \u201cCommunication is the greatest infrastructure,\u201d he said. He has also been an adroit user of social media, such as by airing the one-person media broadcast \u201cWon-soon\u2019s X-file\u201d every Thursday night. He said that it was to communicate better with citizens regarding sensitive issues in Seoul. As a popular politician among the liberals, Park\u2019s status as the mayor of the country\u2019s capital has been considered a sure ticket to gaining his presidential candidacy in the upcoming presidential race.\u201cRecent incidents surely caused damage to Mayor Park\u2019s political move, but it was something that Korea\u2019s entire political circle should feel responsible for. That\u2019s why Mayor Park needs to take the bull by the horns, by himself,\u201d Youn Tae-gon, a political analyst told The Korea Herald. \u201cPark will be able to come up with an answer by having more talks with media and citizens and he should resolve the issue in a calm manner,\u201d he added. According to a poll on some 3,000 adults here released by Real Meter on Sunday, Park held an approval rating of 6.7 percent, a 1.2 percentage point fall compared to the previous week. He particularly suffered a decline in ratings among young respondents within the past week, with an about 3.7 percentage point fall among those in their 20s and a 3.3 percentage point fall among those in their 30s. It is not Mayor Park\u2019s first time at the center of social conflicts. Another of them is a dispute with parents and civic group members of children with development disabilities who claim he has been ignoring their calls to talk. Parents and members of the Korean Parents\u2019 Network for People with Disabilities have been staging an all-night sit-in protest at the back gate of Seoul city hall since May 4. They have been urging Seoul City to accept their proposals to support housing facilities for those with developmental disabilities and a pension plan. Over the last month, the main entrances to the city hall have been ordered to be blocked to deter civic group members from entering the building.Last Friday, Park eventually made an appearance at the back gate for a two-hour long conversation. He reportedly recommended that protesters join the city-run task force and resolve the situation through talk.Seoul City explained that it was difficult for the city to accept the group\u2019s proposals. It added that supporting their proposal requires a lot of funding as well as in-depth discussion with the central government.Park has also been mired in an issue with residents and redevelopment association members of the Okbaraji Golmok in Jongno, where most of the buildings in the alley have been demolished for the redevelopment project.The alley was approved for redevelopment by Seoul Metropolitan Government in July 2015 after it was designated as a redevelopment zone in 2006, citing it as \u201csuitable for redevelopment considering the area\u2019s poor infrastructure and the age of the buildings.\u201dSome of the residents and civic groups have been resisting the demolition citing the site\u2019s historical value of having been the temporary home of activists that had fought for independence in the 1930s.Park visited the site three weeks ago after a physical dispute on May 17 between the resisting residents and a gang trying to vacate Gubonjang, one of the remaining buildings.\u201cEven if it costs me a compensation suit, I will block (forced evacuation) by all means,\u201d Park had said. While Seoul City has vowed to eradicate forced evacuations in the city\u2019s development projects since 2013, there are no ordinances to protect residents who are evacuated from their own homes in the course of redevelopment, nor can the mayor stop the demolition. Some viewed Mayor Park\u2019s actions to stop the forcible removal as belated.While the demolition of the remaining houses has been halted since then, Mayor Park proposed to have marathon talks with those involved to seek a solution. But it is undecided whether the discussion will be held due to protesters opposing the participation of the builder and the redevelopment association. Meanwhile, Seoul City announced Tuesday that it would speed up the follow-up investigation into the subway platform accident on May 28 by forming a committee comprised of city officials, Seoul Metro officials and experts. Kim Ji-hyoung, a former justice of the Supreme Court will head the committee and complete the fact-finding process by July.\u201cI will look for various methods to resolve the situation and for the better working environments of young workers, part-time workers and subcontractor workers,\u201d said Park at a press briefing.\u201cI will move on with a new attitude, disposing old habits and starting from the beginning, thinking that 1 percent in safety means 100 percent safety,\u201d added Park.

We're currently in the strategic and economic dialogue,\" Rhodes said, referring to the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue under way in Beijing.\"And (Treasury Secretary) Jack Lew, I'm sure, has been addressing this, among many other topics. So, what we're going to try to do in the near term is work with China so that they're cooperative in enforcing sanctions,\" he said. \"So that remains our preference. And, of course, we'll be able to evaluate going forward the strength of Chinese implementation.\"Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the North as a \"primary money laundering concern,\" a powerful sanction designed to cut off the provocative regime from the international banking system for defiantly pursuing nuclear and missile development.The designation means banks around the world could be blacklisted if found to be doing business with Pyongyang. The measure was largely seen as targeting China as the North is believe to be conducting most transactions through the neighboring nation.\"We have not stopped the advance of North Korea's nuclear program and the continued testing of both nuclear weapons and missile systems by the North Koreans is the most serious proliferation challenge that we face in the world today,\" Rhodes said.He noted that the U.N. Security Council has imposed the toughest sanctions on the North, and the measure, if implemented, will make \"a significant difference.\" The adoption of sanctions is a sign that the international community, including China, is taking North Korean provocations seriously, he said.

So we have limitations. If THAAD is deployed to U.S. forces in Korea, our capability will be dramatically enhanced.There are definite military benefits to this,\" Defense Minister Han Min-koo said in an interview with CNN.Han spoke in Singapore, where he attended the annual regional defense ministers' meeting. The so-called Shangri-La Dialogue highlighted a deepening row between South Korea and China over THAAD as China has explicitly expressed its opposition to Washington's move to deploy it to the South.Han said the North has sharply increased missile tests since leader Kim Jong-un came to power, conducting 25 tests in his four-year rule, compared with 18 tests carried out when his father and late leader Kim Jong-un was in power for 18 years.\"We assess Kim Jong-un is still in the process of establishing his leadership and influence,\" Han said.The minister also said the North's leader is \"rash\" and \"impulsive.\"\"Kim Jong-un was just 27 when he came to power with very little time to prepare. Add to that, he's very young. He lacks experience and he has a rash and impulsive character. We are very concerned,\" he said.Han said South Korea believes the North's nuclear warhead miniaturization capability has advanced to a great degree, but added that there is no solid evidence that the North has actually achieved it.Asked whether he believes the North is capable of putting a nuclear warhead on to a missile, Han said, \"At this point, our assessment is we don't believe they can.\"Should North Korea continue to make progress in its miniaturization technology, however, Han said that it may be possible for the North to deliver it \"in other ways, such as an artillery shell or in the form of a nuclear mine.\"Han stressed that South Korea, the U.S. and the international community won't recognize Pyongyang as a nuclear weapons state, and underscored the importance of keeping pressure on the North and implement sanctions to make it give up its nuclear weapons program.

The technologies in question were the AESA radar, radio frequency jammer, electronic optics targeting pod and infrared search and track system. South Korea has since announced it would develop the core technologies itself. The military last month selected Hanwha Thales as its priority negotiation partner in developing the advanced radar. The decision itself sparked another controversy as the Defense Ministry and other related government bodies had often referred to the radar developing experience of LIG Nex1 Co. to counter arguments that the country cannot develop its own AESA radar, leading many to believe that the company would be the obvious choice.A military official said that while LIG Nex1 was not inferior to its rival in technology, the overall score across all other categories including costs was in favor of Hanwha Thales. This indicated that the selection of Hanwha Thales may be more related to costs and other factors rather than technology itself.DAPA announced last week that it chose General Electronics as the preferred bidder to supply twin engines for the KF-X project, drawing complaints that the technology for the new fighter jets was \u201ctoo American.\u201dRep. Kim Jong-dae of the minority opposition Justice Party, pointed out that the U.S. was generally reluctant to transfer its military know-how, raising concerns about Seoul relying heavily on equipment from other countries. The U.S.\u2019 protective attitude was demonstrated in its refusal to transfer core technology from F-35.Lingering questions remain on the feasibility of the domestic development of the fighter jet technology. Another military official, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said that several high-ranking officials have had second thoughts on pushing ahead with the KF-X project, since the technology transfer plan has gone down the drain.A DAPA official said that the contingency plan would be to ensure the completion of the KF-X by its deadline. The agency plans to complete the basic design of the jets by 2018.In past cases, the military had also decided to buy equipment that they had originally planned to develop on their own.Domestic technology was to be used for the TAC-ELINT pod installed on the RF-16 tactical reconnaissance aircraft currently used by the Air Force.But an industrial source said that the development of one of the pod types -- originally to be completed by 2013 -- was delayed. The air force is currently using an Israeli-built pod for that particular type of reconnaissance.Frequent flaws have also cast doubts upon domestically developed military technology.The K-2 Black Panther tanks were also originally slated to be equipped with domestically-built power packs, which are the main components of a motor vehicle that generate power. But in 2012, a year before its mass production, the agency had said that it would use foreign-built power packs if the domestic equipment was proven to be faulty. The initial 100 tanks ended up with German-built power packs, indicating defects in the Korean power packs.The DAPA said on May 10 that defects were found in the homegrown Surion utility and that it would cooperate with related agencies to fix the problem.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","815":"The United States and China on Monday opened annual high-level talks amid tensions over China's aggressive island-building activities in the South China Sea as well as trade disputes between the world's two largest economies. \u00a0\u00a0 North Korea was also expected to be on the agenda for the two-day U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED;).

Japan pays us a small fraction of the cost, a very small fraction. I want them to pay us at least the cost,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN. \"It's actually less than 50 percent. But a general got on and said 50 percent recently. But, even if it was 50 percent, why aren't they paying us 100 percent?\"Trump was talking about Japan and made no mention of South Korea, but the 50 percent part appeared to be about Seoul's cost-sharing because the \"general\" Trump referred to is believed to be new U.S. Forces Korea Commander Vincent Brooks. In a Senate confirmation hearing in April, Brooks said that South Korea currently pays about half the cost, about $900 million a year, to help finance the stationing of some 28,500 troops, and that it would cost more to keep those troops stationed in the U.S. than it does in Korea.Trump insisted that 50 percent is far from enough.\"Of course they should pay 100 percent. You're talking about billions and billions of dollars, and you're talking about worse than that. You're talking about World War III. Somebody attacks Japan, and we end up in World War III,\" he said on CNN. He also reiterated that the U.S. should be prepared to end the protection of allies.\"You have to be prepared to walk from a deal. You can't go in there saying -- like Hillary said, 'We will never let our partners down. We will never, never, never.' OK, that's wonderful, except, you know what? If I'm Japan, I say good. We'll keep paying the 50 percent,\" Trump said.\"You have to be prepared to walk ... these are very smart people we're dealing with, OK? They've been ripping us off for a long time,\" he said.Trump has even suggested that South Korea and Japan develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense so as to reduce U.S. security burdens.On Sunday, Trump suggested he wouldn't oppose the allies going nuclear, saying \"That's up to them. It's not up to me. It's up to them.\"Maximizing U.S. interests through negotiation is the No. 1 point in Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy. Trump and aides have repeatedly emphasized the businessman is an excellent negotiator and is ready to use the skill to regain American interests lost under Democratic administrations.Trump has even expressed a willingness to negotiate with North Korea's leader, saying in a media interview, \"I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him.\" The remark also sparked criticism that a meeting with the North would end up bolstering the dictator.On Friday, Trump reiterated the willingness to talk to the North.\"They said, 'Would you mind having negotiations with North Korea?' No problem. Who the hell cares? You have a negotiation. I'm not going there. But you have a negotiation. They say, 'We will never talk; we will never talk.' How stupid are these people,\" Trump said during a campaign rally in California Friday.\"Who knows if the talks work. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. They probably will, if you want to know the truth,\" he said. \"I'm not talking from weakness, folks. I know all about negotiating from weakness and from strength.\"His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has strongly criticized Trump for belittling allies, stressing that the U.S. is stronger and safer thanks to the \"power of allies.\" She also accused Trump of having \"bizarre fascination with dictators and strong men who have no love for America.\" (Yonhap)","817":"President Park Geun-hye said Tuesday that North Korea could self-destruct unless it embraces change, the latest in a series of strongly worded warnings aimed at pressuring North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons program.Tensions have spiked on the divided Korean Peninsula as North Korea has ratcheted up its bellicose rhetoric in response to the massive military drills under way between South Korea and the United States.North Korea could \"trod the path of self-destruction by itself if it does not move toward the path of change while continuing its provocations and strong confrontation with the international community,\" Park said in a Cabinet meeting.Hours earlier North Korea announced its plans to carry out more nuclear warhead and ballistic missile tests.Pyongyang's move is widely seen as the latest sign of defiance against tough U.N. sanctions imposed on the communist country for its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and long-range rocket launch on Feb. 7.The sanctions call for, among other things, the mandatory inspection of all cargo going into and out of the North, and a ban on the country's exports of coal and other mineral resources to cut off North Korea's access to hard currency.Park called on the military to maintain readiness to retaliate against North Korea if Pyongyang stages provocations against Seoul.

Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to Tehran last Saturday, becoming the first international leader to visit Iran after the nuclear-related sanctions were lifted on Jan. 16. Beijing inked 17 agreements with Tehran for cooperation in energy, trade and other areas. China is currently Iran\u2019s largest trading partner with bilateral trade surpassing $50 billion in 2014, while the trade volume between Korea and Iran in the year dipped to $8.6 billion, less than half the trade volume recorded in 2011. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is also considering visiting Iran after its dispatch of a massive business delegation last year.

Seoul officials have expressed confidence in bolstering ties with Tehran, arguing that despite U.S.-led nuclear sanctions against Iran, South Korea has been struggling to maintain adequate bilateral economic relations.However, observers say that Seoul should do more to keep up with other nations, and that it needs to craft a more sophisticated, long-term diplomatic strategy toward the Middle East and reduce its excessive diplomatic focus on Northeast Asia and the U.S.\u201cSeoul\u2019s efforts are somewhat belated given that other nations have already been scurrying to court Tehran and boost their economic ties with it.

Suicide has become the fourth most common cause of death here.\u00a0 According to the report by the Health and Welfare Ministry, almost 90 percent of suicide victims had diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, but only 15 percent of them had received medical treatment regularly before taking their own lives.  A sign that says \u201clife line,\u201d a phone counseling service for those who consider committing suicide by jumping into the Hangang River, is installed at Seoul\u2019s Mapo Bridge. YonhapAlso, while only 25.1 percent of them had visited a psychiatrist at least once in the last 30 days of their lives, a higher proportion of them -- 25.6 percent -- visited a general physician or a traditional Korean doctor for symptoms such as indigestion or insomnia in the same period.\u00a0One of the victims featured in the report, a man in his 40s, visited a general physician after experiencing loss of appetite and weight loss. The physician diagnosed his condition as chronic fatigue and did not advise him to seek help from a mental health professional. According to researchers of the report, it is likely that his condition may have been depression. He took his own life a few months later.Jeon Hong-jin, a psychiatrist at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, said many studies have indicated that about 70 to 90 percent of all suicide victims worldwide have a psychiatric illness, including depression. What is unique in South Korea, he said, is the collective avoidance of psychiatric treatment which is deeply linked to the social stigma against people with mental illnesses. According to a report released by the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency last year, about 5.6 percent of the entire Korean population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 have suffered depression at least once. However, only 290,000 people sought medical help for the condition, as of last year, and an even smaller number of them, 150,000, chose to receive treatment regularly. \u201cA lot of people are unaware of their mental condition because people avoid visiting psychiatric clinics. But (being unaware of one\u2019s condition) can be dangerous,\u201d psychiatrist Jeon told The Korea Herald. \u201cWhen someone with severe depression doesn\u2019t know he is clinically depressed, it\u2019s more likely that he would find his situation hopeless and take his own life. Being diagnosed can give a sense of control, because once you are diagnosed you can learn that there are treatment options available for you to get better.\u201dThe report also showed that 40 percent of the 121 victims were drunk when they committed suicide. Also, 25.6 percent had faced legal, professional and personal conflicts resulting from alcohol abuse. At the same time, 54 percent of the victims had family members who had alcohol abuse problems. \u201cIt can be concluded that alcohol abuse is very closely associated with suicide cases in South Korea and that drinking control is necessary as an intervention measure for suicide prevention,\u201d the report said.South Korea is known for its culture of binge drinking. According to analysis by the global research firm Euromonitor International, South Koreans were the world\u2019s biggest consumers of hard liquor as of 2014, drinking 11.2 shots per week on average.Many overseas studies have shown that social isolation is one of the most significant factors that contribute to a number of mental health conditions, including depression, addiction, hoarding and social anxiety. According to the OECD data last year, 28 percent of Koreans said they have no meaningful social support at all - not a single person they can rely on - in times of crisis. This rate was the highest among the OECD nations. \u201cHuman beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we are happy and healthy, we\u2019ll bond and connect with each other,\u201d said British journalist Johann Hari who has researched and written extensively on addiction of all kinds, during TED talk last year. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t do that, because you are traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will go with something that will give you some sense of relief (such as drugs or alcohol).\u201dAccording to the World Health Organization, alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions worldwide, including cancer, road traffic crashes, violence, and suicides. \u201cBeyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at large,\u201d the WHO said in its factsheet on the harmful use of alcohol.The government report on suicide also found that 93.4 percent of victims exhibited some suicide warning signs, such as experiencing a change in sleeping and eating habits, but 81 percent of the victims\u2019 family members did not consider these signs as anything to be alarmed about.\u00a0By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","825":"South Korea voiced deep regret Wednesday that North Korea rebuked President Park Geun-hye for stressing the need to hand down stronger sanctions over the North's nuke test in her recent national address.North Korea's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, said Tuesday that the South Korean leader delivered a national speech to avert a political crisis, calling her a devil of this era indulged in a dictatorship.On Jan. 13, Park vowed to make all diplomatic efforts to ensure that the U.N.

But better late than never,\u201d said Chang Byung-ock, an Iran expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\u201cSeoul should strengthen its summit diplomacy with Tehran and devise a long-term, stable strategy to deal with crucial Middle East partners rather than keep making quick-fix solutions all of a sudden, whenever something transpires.\u201dAs part of its efforts to restore lost ground in the Iranian market, Seoul has been seeking to hold various consultations involving government officials, local banks and businesses.On Wednesday, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport held a meeting with bankers and entrepreneurs to discuss ways to support local businesses hoping to advance into Iran\u2019s infrastructure construction market.Seoul also plans to resume the bilateral minister-level economic cooperation panel meeting -- suspended since 2006 due to economic sanctions -- late next month or early March.\u00a0\u00a0 By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","827":"The Navy chief ordered maritime forces Tuesday to stand with full combat readiness for the possibility of unexpected military provocations by North Korea.\"The enemy has always launched provocations in manners and timings that are hard for us to predict,\" Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon vowed stern actions to root out employers\u2019 intentional, habitual delay in payment and exploitation of young workers during a meeting between the government and the ruling Saenuri Party at the National Assembly. The guidelines will include a ban on companies making interns work overtime, at weekends and on holidays. The internship period will also be limited to six months, Lee said.  Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kown delivers an opening speech at a meeting held with the ruling Saenuri Party at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapThe move came amid criticism that companies offer \u201cpassion pay\u201d to young job seekers desperate to find employment and gain work experience to brighten their job prospects. \u201cPassion pay\u201d refers to the practice of companies taking advantage of people\u2019s passion to work as an excuse to pay them very little, sometimes nothing. Last year for instance, controversy flared when prominent fashion designer Lee Sang-bong was found to have paid trainees 100,000 won ($83), including overtime pay, in monthly wage. Full-time workers earned 1.1 million won per month. The monthly minimum wage was set at 1.16 million at the time.Such practices have been more common in recent years amid the heightened competition for jobs among youth as companies have downsized on recruitments in the face of faltering economic conditions. The jobless rate among young people between 15 and 29 years old stood at 9.2 percent last year, much higher than the 3.6 percent unemployment rate for the country as a whole, according to government data. According to a survey of 5,219 young people aged between 19 and 34 by the Presidential Committee on the Young Generation released last year, about half of young people in South Korea said they have experienced \u201cpassion wages.\u201d Seven in 10 took home less than the minimum wage or worked for free, the study showed.Among those who responded that they had received substandard wages, 57.5 percent said they had done the same kind of work as regular employees for much less pay.In a separate survey on 1,204 job seekers in their 20s and 30s released last year by a job portal site Alba Heaven, 65.2 percent of the respondents thought they would put up with \u201cpassion pay\u201d and poor working conditions during their internship, with the majority considering the difficulties as part of their life experience. \u201cWe will announce guidelines on \u2018passion pay\u2019 so that the young can receive what they deserve,\u201d Lee said during the meeting. \u201cWe will also impose financial penalties right at the scene through stepped-up monitoring in the coming weeks.\u201d According to government data, a total of 296,000 employees across the country were not properly paid in due time last year, with the amount of overdue wages hitting a record high of 1.29 trillion won ($1.07 billion) in 2015.As part of its plan, the ministry will enhance its legal support for workers and consulting services for employees to make sure employees are paid their overdue wages. In the run-up to this year\u2019s Lunar New Year\u2019s holiday on Feb. 8, the ministry launched intensive monitoring Monday on workplaces to encourage companies to pay employees their due salaries in a timely manner. It mobilized 10 centers across the country to which laborers can report their overdue payment. Rep. Kim Jung-hoon of the ruling Saenuri Party said the party will make efforts and cooperate with the government to swiftly pass a set of related bills on wage defaulters and \u201cpassion pay.\u201dThe labor minister\u2019s comments also came in light of persisting controversy between the government and workers over government-led labor reform measures. The government has pushed for the market revamp to expand job opportunities for the young and create a virtuous cycle of outgoing and incoming workforce. But the nation\u2019s umbrella union groups have opposed the plan, viewing it as only benefiting businesses by making it easier to sack workers and hire more irregular workers.

That's why I'm going there: to hear their point of view, to share thoughts, to share ideas about how we can proceed -- all of us together -- in a smart and thoughtful way that could get a result,\" Kerry said.\"And I'm not going to get into the what ifs or things we may or may not do one way or the other. I think that deserves to be talked with them privately and carefully,\" he said.Kerry's visit to Beijing, set to begin on Wednesday, will be closely watched as a gauge of how strong a punishment China will mete out to the recalcitrant ally that China also considers a strategic buffer against the United States and its allies.China has condemned the North's nuclear test, but has been lukewarm about calls for stern responses. Analysts have long said that Beijing fears pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation next door.Chinese cooperation is key to putting together any meaningful punishment as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel for the impoverished North.On Sunday, a senior State Department official said that the U.S. wants China to cooperate not only in U.N. Security Council sanctions, but also take unilateral steps to punish Pyongyang \"as North Korea's lifeline, as North Korea's patron.\"The official also called for China to \"cut off avenues of proliferation and retard North Korea's ability to gain the wherewithal to advance its nuclear and its missile programs,\"saying Pyongyang is still engaged in illicit and proliferation activities through means involving transiting China.Kerry has made no secret of his conviction that there is \"much more that China can do by way of applying leverage,\" the official said, adding that the top American diplomat will be looking for practical and effective steps on the part of the Chinese.

The outside world suspects the test may have been a traditional atomic bomb or a boosted fission bomb, but, nonetheless, the test showed the communist country is advancing its nuclear capability.The U.S. has reportedly been seeking the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, but Seoul has officially maintained that nothing has been decided, a stance taken to fend off China's protest.Touching on North Korea's submarine-launched ballistic missile capability, Han said North Korea may deploy SLBMs for combat use in about three to four years or even earlier.\"North Korea is at the stage of completing the underwater ejection test,\" Han said, referring to the four stages of SLBM development: the tests of above-the-ground ejection, underwater ejection, flight and field deployment.\"For other countries it took three to four years to deploy (SLBMs) after underwater ejection tests, but it could happen more quickly if the North musters every possible effort,\" according to Han. The North was reported to have conducted its latest SLBM ejection test in December.The North is predicted to launch a variety of military provocations going forward, on which the North is relying for the consolidation of internal unity as the country is pushing for both nuclear and economic development, the minister said.\"On the strategic level, the North could conduct more nuclear tests of missile launches and on the tactical front, it could launch military provocations on frontline islands and military outposts or terrorist acts in regions in the back,\" he said.

Security Council adopted a new sanctions resolution on Pyongyang earlier this month in response to the North's nuclear and missile tests. The sanctions, the toughest ever to be imposed on Pyongyang, require mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North and ban its exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a key source of hard currency that accounts for nearly half of the country's total exports.The U.S. is putting together a package of unilateral sanctions against the North to carry out the Security Council sanctions and the recent congressional legislation tightening the screws on Pyongyang.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said an Eastar Jet B737-700 passenger jet with 149 people on board took off safely at 2:48 p.m. after ground service personnel cleared the runway and removed ice and snow from the aircraft.About 36 minutes later, a Korean Air B747-400 with 404 people on-board departed for Seoul's Gimpo International Airport.The resumption comes after heavy snow forced one of South Korea's busiest airports to go dark early Saturday evening, which resulted in flight cancellations and thousands of stranded travelers.Exact numbers have not been made public, but it is estimated some 86,900 people have been stuck, with 1,400 having been forced to stay at the airport terminal.The local weather service lifted the heavy wind and snow warnings earlier in the day as the sold high-pressure front that engulfed most of the country started to weaken.Airport authorities and the transport ministry said the 34 planes stuck at the airport will be cleared of ice and snow and be allowed to take off, although this can take some time.Passengers who had booked flights leaving the resort island have been contacted in advance to get ready for departure, although there may be some congestion in processing. Upwards of 7,000 people may try to leave at once, authorities predicted.The transport ministry said under normal conditions Jeju airport, with one main runway, can accommodate 34 takeoffs and landings per hour. The airport in the northern part of the island can process around 40,000 passengers daily.It said because so many people have been stranded and all want to get back home as soon as possible, flight operations at both Jeju and Gimpo airports will be pushed back temporarily past the normal 11 p.m. mark.The ministry said that in order to help people stranded on Jeju, airlines are expected to reroute more flights, in addition to regularly scheduled flights. This can add more seats and speed up departures. Korean Air, South Korea's No. 1 carrier, said it will operate an extra 60 flights to the island overnight that can ferry some 13,000 people off the island by 6 a.m. Tuesday. Asiana Airlines said it will send 43 flights that can handle 9,900 passengers.

After a series of negotiations, they reached a memorandum of understanding in May last year to push for the restoration project.The Seoul city government plans to use the sidewalk as a sightseeing destination to show the coexistence between the Korean and British cultures.Deoksu Palace is one of the capital's five palaces. The others are Gyeongbok, Gyeonghui, Changdeok and Changgyeong. Representing remarkable architectural achievements, the palaces were turned to near ruin during the Japanese invasion (1592-98) and colonial occupation (1910-45).In the late years of the Joseon Dynasty, Jeongdong, where the Deoksu Palace and its sidewalks are located, comprised the residences and embassies of Western powers and foreign missionaries.

Choi Jong-sam, head of the National Training Center in Seoul, said how the athletes prepare themselves in the next month or so will make or break their chances of reaching the podiums in Rio.\"For our athletes to be able to compete at a high level, they have to be well-conditioned,\" Choi said. \"It will help them take the next step. Many of our forefathers in sports have emphasized conditioning over skills and techniques. We're trying to steer our athletes in that direction.\"South Korea will be gunning for its fourth consecutive top 10 finish in the Summer Olympic medal table. Earlier this month, Infostrada Sports, a Dutch sports data analysis firm, unveiled its Virtual Medal Table (VMT) and projected South Korea to win 12 gold medals.It would fall just one shy of South Korea's all-time record of 13, set in Beijing in 2008 and matched in London in 2012.The projection may vary in the coming months with Olympic qualifications still under way in some sports.Archery, though, will almost certainly be a major goldmine for South Korea once again. South Korea has grabbed 19 gold medals since the start of modern archery competition in 1972, more than any other nation. It won three out of four archery gold medals in London, and the VMT predicts that South Korea will pull off a sweep of all four titles -- men's and women's individual and team events-- for the first time in Rio.Leading the way in London was Ki Bo-bae, who captured both the individual and team gold medals in the women's competition. The South Korean talent pool in archery is so deep that Ki actually missed the national team for the 2014 Asian Games -- the running joke in archery is that it's more difficult to make the national team than to win an Olympic medal -- but she has since found her groove again.Now she's attempting to make history -- becoming the first South Korean female archer to defend an Olympic individual gold medal.The 27-year-old said she won't look that far down the road just yet, knowing making the national team will be no easy task.\"Four years have gone by fast, and Rio is just around the corner. But I think it's premature to talk about winning back-to-back gold medals,\" she said. \"I have to get on the team first at the Olympic team trials in March.\"Moon Hyung-chul, head coach of the archery team, sounded decidedly more confident.\"Our goal is always to win every gold medal at stake,\" he said before flying to Rio last week for an early training session with the current national team. \"When we came up short in international competitions before, it wasn't because we lacked skills. We failed to adjust to the local climate and other conditions. We have to closely analyze our reasons for those close calls and get ready for the Olympics.\"Unlike Ki and other archers, Lee Dae-hoon in men's taekwondo won't have to worry about making the Olympic team. One of South Korea's projected gold medalists by VMT, Lee has been awarded an automatic berth based on his Olympic ranking position by the World Taekwondo Federation.The 23-year-old has won virtually every title a taekwondo fighter can win, except for an Olympic gold. He has two world titles, two Asian Games gold medals and two Asian championships under his belt but settled for silver in the 58-kilogram class at his Olympic debut four years ago.Lee will be competing in the 68-kilogram division in Rio, where he hopes to do one better on the podium.\"In London, I don't think I competed the way I am capable of,\" he said. \"It wasn't that I was disappointed with the silver.

I want to make sure things will be different this time.\"Lee said he will be up against \"taller and stronger\" opponents in the heavier weight class, but added, \"I will study and analyze them closely and prepare the best I can.\"Where Lee might have fallen short of expectations in London, South Korean fencers shocked the world with their monumental performance in the British capital, winning two gold, one silver and three bronze medals. Only Italy, with three gold, two silver and two bronze medals, picked up more fencing medals than South Korea.One of the South Korean gold medalists, Kim Ji-yeon in women's sabre, said she's trying to temper her own expectations, lest the pressure to repeat affect her preparations.\"If I set my goal too high, there will just be too much pressure,\" she said. \"I was only trying to enjoy myself in London, and I am hoping to have the same mindset going into Rio.\"She's battling some pains in her left hip area and said staying healthy is almost as important as conditioning and technical training.\"Compared to four years ago, my rivals have improved a great deal in terms of their techniques and tactics,\" Kim said. \"I am studying their videos closely to get a better sense of the competition.\"The other gold medal in London came from the men's sabre team event, with Gu Bon-gil leading the way. The 26-year-old said the Olympic gold has put a bull's-eye on the back of South Korean fencers.\"Ever since London, other countries have been keeping an even closer eye on us,\" said the former world No. 1, who is now the third-ranked male sabre fencer. \"But it's business as usual for us, as we get ready for the Olympics by competing in World Cups and Grand Prix events.\"In Rio, South Korean judokas will try to pull off some surprises of their own. South Korea has claimed at least one judo gold medal in each of the past three Olympics, and three up-and-comers will be looking to extend the winning tradition.An Ba-ul won his first world championship last August in the men's 66kg class, adding to his gold at the Summer Universiade a month earlier. The 21-year-old had earlier won the world junior championship in 2013, and an Olympic gold will cap off an impressive run of international victories.Gwak Dong-han also won both the world championship and the Summer Universiade gold last year in the men's 90kg class, climbing to the No. 1 spot in International Judo Federation's world rankings in his division. The 23-year-old also has an Asian championship to his credit.\"People may be expecting big things because I've done well of late, but I don't think I am yet good enough to be ranked No. 1 in the world,\" Gwak said. \"I have to study my rivals closely and train hard to do well at the Olympics.\"While An and Gwak both won their first world titles last summer, An Chang-rim in the men's 73kg class settled for bronze after bowing out to his main nemesis, Shohei Ono of Japan, in the semifinals.Ono has had An's numbers in recent meetings, having also beaten him at the Tokyo Grand Slam in December 2014 and at the Dusseldorf Grand Prix in May last year.An did win the Universiade gold and the Asian championship last year to rise to No. 2 in the world rankings, four spots ahead of Ono, but the South Korean said the rankings can be thrown out the window.\"I was disappointed to walk away with only the bronze medal at the world championships,\" An said. \"Obviously, Ono will be a strong contender. I will try to do better at the Olympics. I just have to get better and prepare as if this will be my last Olympics.\" (Yonhap)","844":"A war of nerves appears to be brewing between the allies -- South Korea and the U.S. -- and China over their approach to North Korea, spawning concerns that any discord would hurt the ongoing efforts to adopt stringent sanctions for Pyongyang\u2019s fourth nuclear test.Since President Park Geun-hye expressed skepticism over the efficacy of the long-stalled six-party talks and called for five-party talks -- excluding North Korea -- last Friday, the allies and China seem to be split with Beijing in favor of keeping the six-party format intact.The talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia have not been held since late 2008. Park thus proposed exploring \u201cvarious and creative ways\u201d including holding the five-party talks to tackle the North\u2019s nuclear conundrum, her aides said.Washington has offered support for Park\u2019s proposal for the five-party talks, while Beijing urged the early resumption of the six-party talks that it has hosted -- a move that observers say displayed its disapproval of the five-way formula.\u201cThe United States supports President Park\u2019s call for a five-party meeting. We believe coordination with the other parties would be a useful step in our ongoing efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula through credible and authentic negotiations,\u201d a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said in a statement to the local media.Amid Beijing\u2019s apparent opposition, Seoul said that its proposal for the five-party talks does not mean dismantlement of the six-way dialogue, and that the five-way talks can be held within the six-party framework.But Park\u2019s call for the five-party talks is largely seen as part of her move to pressure Beijing to support the efforts to draw up a U.N. Security Council resolution entailing harsher anti-Pyongyang sanctions, and to exert more influence to curb the growth of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program.In recent weeks, Park has tacitly raised pressure on Beijing to use its leverage to persuade its wayward ally to renounce nuclear ambitions, stressing the importance of Beijing\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d role in addressing the issue.To the chagrin of Seoul, Beijing has maintained a lukewarm position, calling on the concerned parties to show \u201ccaution and restraint\u201d in handling what the reclusive regime claims to be a hydrogen bomb test.Beijing\u2019s stance has triggered criticism here of Park\u2019s policy toward China, with some demanding that she reorient her policy toward China and put more stress on the importance of the security ally, the U.S. Detractors even called Seoul\u2019s policy toward Beijing a failure.Seoul\u2019s Second Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, however, said that it is inappropriate to evaluate the overall relations between Seoul and Beijing based on the latter\u2019s response to the North\u2019s nuclear test.\u201cThe South Korea-China relations are something we should upgrade harmoniously as we upgrade the Korea-U.S. relations,\u201d he said in a program on news channel YTN. \u201cEven if we invest in the (South Korea-China) relations today, we will not reap our investments right away.

Any future dialogue will be pursued on the foundation of trust and international standards, with denuclearization and military tension newly being added to the agenda. \u201cFor the time being, we will concentrate on sanctions and pressure, because North Korea must face due consequences for its peace-destroying activity,\u201d Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo said during a separate press conference, when asked whether the ministry will not take any bilateral dialogue offer unless Pyongyang agrees to multilateral denuclearization talks. \u201cEven when we feel the need to talk, the dialogue must not be for the sake of dialogue. The bottom line is that it should contribute to the normal development of inter-Korean relations and peninsula peace.\u201d On the envisaged task force, he said: \u201cThe situation has obviously changed, and inter-Korean dialogue and exchanges will be tremendously difficult to do if the nuclear problem isn\u2019t solved. So we\u2019ve decided to launch the team to devise ideas and policy alternatives for our part.\u201d Yet this year\u2019s policy outline failed to address fresh ideas and detailed action plans such as on how to rally lukewarm major stakeholders behind the sanctions drive. It instead centered heavily on blaming Pyongyang and simply repeated the need for strong penalties and pressure, in which Seoul has limited diplomatic leverage and policy options on its own. The latest briefing also barely touched on plans to improve inter-Korean dialogue and civilian exchanges and help resuscitate the idle six-nation denuclearization talks.Though Park expressed frustration with the forum\u2019s stalemate and called for a five-way meeting that excludes North Korea, its prospects remain dim, given the stark differences in positions between the camps of Seoul, Washington and Tokyo versus Beijing and Moscow.Beefed up miliary intelligenceOn the defense front, the militaries of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are expected to beef up their exchanges of intelligence on North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.

The ministry cited a violation of a labor law clause that bans dismissed education workers from joining trade unions.According to the Education Ministry, this is to ensure that teachers remain politically neutral.Citing the labor law clause, the appellate court said that the ministry\u2019s move against the KTU was a lawful administrative procedure. \u201cPrior to the ministry\u2019s notification, the KTU had decided to reject the government\u2019s request for it to not accept dismissed workers via a member vote, which clearly shows that the KTU is not recognized as a trade union by the labor law,\u201d the court said in its ruling, upholding a decision by the lower court on June 2014. \u201cOn the plaintiff\u2019s appeal that the labor law clause is unconstitutional, the Constitutional Court has already ruled that it does not infringe upon the basic rights. ...

FKTU chairman Kim Dong-man speaks at a news conference on Tuesday. Yonhap\u201cThe government and the ruling party have trampled on the Sept. 15 trilateral agreement, making it null,\u201d FKTU chairman Kim Dong-man said in a press conference.\u201cWe will henceforth renounce all efforts of negotiation and boycott the tripartite committee meeting.\u201dWith the FKTU\u2019s declaration, the confrontation surrounding the labor-related bills is expected to escalate as the presidential office and the ruling party brace for an all-out war against the labor unions and the opposition camp.The Sept. 15 deal, or the \u201cgrand compromise,\u201d refers to the trilateral deal signed last year by the labor, management and government representatives to come up with long-term measures to improve the nation\u2019s labor market. They include allowing companies to change employment guidelines and adopting a \u201cpeak wage\u201d system upon further consultation. Despite the epochal agreement, follow-up consultations have not run smoothly, with the labor side delaying discussion and the government unilaterally releasing measures.The union chairman pledged to file an injunction or an unconstitutionality suit against the government\u2019s labor guidelines and to conduct campaigns against ruling party candidates in the upcoming April parliamentary elections.The union will thus join the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a more progressive labor organization which has all along been protesting against the disputed labor bills.\u201cThe FKTU, by announcing its withdrawal from the trilateral deal, has declared to fight back the government\u2019s retrogressive labor policies,\u201d said KCTU spokesperson Park Seong-sik.\u201cIt seems that the two unions may possibly join forces and form a solidarity.\u201dAt the face of the disintegration of the three-way agreement, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her calls for the passage of the controversial labor bills.\u201cCompanies, whether conglomerates or small and medium-sized enterprises, have repeatedly appealed for the passage of the pending bills, but the National Assembly has neglected their needs,\u201d Park said at the Cabinet meeting.She thereby urged the nation to participate in a petition campaign led by economic organizations, which she referred to as a last resort to save the economy and boost employment.\u201cWould these businessmen and people have rushed out to the streets on this severe winter day (for the petition) if not for these pressing situations?\u201dThe president joined the petition campaign Monday after receiving the annual business reports and before delivering her New Year\u2019s greeting to the Korea Federation of SMEs. The Minjoo Party of Korea denounced the president for detouring due legislative procedure and siding with the conglomerates by joining their initiative.\u201cThe president is entitled to extensive legal power, yet Park decided to sign a petition instead of communicating and debating the issue,\u201d said the main opposition party\u2019s policy committee chief Rep.

Last month, the government announced draft guidelines to allow companies to formally sack underperforming employees and amend employment rules more easily even without consent from workers.The Federation of Korean Trade Unions that represents labor in the trilateral talks, however, has fiercely opposed the plan.

Citing the government's position adopted in 2007, he said the military was involved in setting up \"comfort stations\" -- a euphemism for military brothels -- hygiene control and transportation of the women, but not in their actual recruitment. That was done by civilian pimps at the military's request, he added.South Korea firmly refuted the claims.\"The forced nature of the Japanese military's mobilization of the comfort women is an undeniable historical fact and truth under any circumstance,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said during a press briefing.That statement is backed up by various international reports and studies as well as the victims' testimonies, he said.Asked whether the government has any intention to nullify the December agreement, the spokesman only noted the importance of faithfully carrying out its terms.Under the deal, South Korea promised a final resolution of the issue if Japan fulfills its commitments.\"It would be good to refrain from an atmosphere or actions and words that undermine the fulfillment of the agreement, and it is important to create an environment in which it can be properly carried out,\" Cho said.Seoul has delivered this position to Tokyo on numerous occasions, he added. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for the Japanese military during the war.

This incident has been thrown into a political row between Taiwan and mainland China.The center said in a statement that a \"16-year-old girl waving the national flag of her own country is very natural, but Park Jin-young forced her to make an apology under pressure from Chinese netizens.\"\"We will ask the National Human Rights Commission of Korea to investigate whether the apology was forced or not,\" it said, adding that it will bring the case to the prosecution if the apology was found to be coerced.\"This kind of incident can take place anytime in entertainment agencies which are blind to commercial interests and ignorant of multicultural and human rights,\" the center said.In the past two months, anger among Chinese SNS users over the flag incident forced JYP chief Park Jin-young to offer an apology to Chinese fans and Tzuyu to stop all of her current activities in China.\"Through this incident, I have once again deeply experienced that, to partner with a nation, there is a need to respect that nation's sovereignty, culture, history, and the people's emotions,\" Park said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"In the future, we will firmly put an end to having this kind of incident occur,\" Park said in a recent apology that appeared on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter.In an apparent move to calm controversy, Tzuyu finally came forward and expressed her own personal apology. \"I extended my apology belatedly as I did not know how to handle this situation,\" she said.Meanwhile, Park on Monday denied a news report that a Taiwanese business offered to undertake exclusive contracts for Tzuyu from JYP Entertainment.A source at the entertainment agency said they have never received such an offer for an exclusive contract from a Taiwanese magazine company at the price of 3.6 billion won.(Yonhap)","862":"The U.S. envoy to Korea visited the National Assembly on Monday to renew his calls for easing of restrictions on foreign law firms here citing the bilateral free trade pact, prompting criticism from Korean lawyers\u2019 groups over the envoy\u2019s \u201cintervention in domestic affairs.\u201dMark Lippert, the U.S ambassador to Korea, visited Rep. Lee Sang-min, head of the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee, to deliver a joint statement protesting the current bill on the opening of Korea\u2019s legal market. He allegedly said during the meeting that the bill fails to comply with the \"spirit\" of Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, voicing concerns over possible diplomatic dispute if the bill is passed without amendments.\u00a0 \u201cThe revision contains several terms restricting foreign law firms from setting up a joint venture here. We urge the parliament to adopt a bill opening Korea\u2019s legal services market more completely,\u201d Lippert and three foreign envoys representing the U.K., European Union and Australia said in the statement.\u00a0U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert sits for talks with Rep. Lee Sang-min (right), chairman of the parliamentary judiciary committee, over bills concerning the opening of the legal market at the National Assembly on Monday. YonhapThe four ambassadors have relayed complaints of their respective countries about Korea\u2019s regulations on foreign firms, largely taking issue with clauses banning foreign law firms from owning a stake of more than 49 percent in a joint venture with a Korean firm and requiring them to retain more than three years of experience in the local legal industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe believe from our own experience in the UK that having an open legal services market ultimately strengthens the sector. It creates jobs, attracts investment and enables all firms in the sector to compete regionally and globally. So would be a great benefit to the Korean economy,\u201d Nick Duvivier, a spokesperson for the U.K. Embassy told The Korea Herald. The foreign envoys\u00a0asked the parliament to seek a solution to satisfy all the parties involved through sufficient consultation before legislating the vote. As Korea agreed to fully open its market to the EU by July 2016 and the U.S. by March 2017, the Justice Ministry proposed a revised draft of the Foreign Legal Consultant Act last August to implement the final stage of the legal market liberalization under the free trade agreements with the countries. Under the revised bill, the foreign law firms are allowed to set up joint ventures with Korean counterparts, hire Korean lawyers and partially practice domestic law as the final step. But they are banned from representing clients in Korean courtrooms, owning a stake more than a Korean firm in the joint venture and handling domestic cases related to labor, inheritance and government affairs. A total of 26 law firms from the U.S. and U.K. have opened their offices in Seoul since the trade deals came into effect in 2012 and 2011, respectively, with most of them focused on offering consulting services for mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property, initial public offerings and cross-border litigation. According to sources in the legal community, South Korea\u2019s legal market is estimated to be worth around 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion), though the official figure is not available.The Justice Ministry maintained that the revision complies with the free trade agreements as the pact enabled Korean government to set conditions of the Foreign Legal Consultant Act.\u00a0\u201cThe Justice Ministry has sufficiently collected opinions from academia, domestic and foreign lawyers\u2018 groups to write the bill in accordance with the free trade agreement,\u201d an official from the Justice Ministry told The Korea Herald.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Justice Ministry imposed the condition of minimum experiences for foreign law firms to guarantee a minimal level of legal services quality for Korean consumers,\u201d the official said.\u00a0\"As Korea is in the initial stage of opening of the market, there should also be a platform for local firms to contribute to the legal services market.\"In response to the foreign envoy\u2019s visit to his office, Rep. Lee Sang-min said that he would take more time to review the bill in the committee to prevent possible diplomatic clashes arising from the bill. \u201cAcknowledging the complaints from the trade partner countries, I have not tabled the bill for a vote,\u201d Lee told reporters after the meeting. \u201cI asked the Justice Ministry to make efforts to minimize the diplomatic dispute after consulting the countries, foreign and industry ministries to map out a comprehensive stance at the national level.\u201d\u00a0Lee hinted that\u00a0he would pass the bill in the parliamentary committee within next month and submit it to the plenary session of National Assembly for a vote in May to legislate it. The Assembly is currently in deadlock over other economic related bills with the new parliament slated to be elected on April 13.Earlier\u00a0this month, Lee delayed putting the bill up for a vote at the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee upon complaints from\u00a0 the\u00a0ambassadors. But his decision to put off the vote triggered criticisms among lawmakers and lawyers\u2019 groups that the parliament caved in to foreign pressure which\u00a0was an intervention in the nation\u2019s sovereignty. \u201cThe protest visit made by four countries\u2019 ambassadors to Korea to protect their law firms\u2019 interests is clearly violation to South Korea\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d Korea Bar Association said in a statement. \u201cThey are forcing the parliament to discriminate against local law firms for the sake of foreign law firms, an action that is beyond their authority.\u201dAnother lawyers\u2019 group Seoul Bar Association aired similar concerns, vowing to send formal complaints to the foreign embassies later in the day. \u201cIt is an intervention in domestic affairs that ambassadors protested the National Assembly\u2019s legislative power citing diplomatic dispute.\" Refuting the accusations, Rep.\u00a0Lee said that it was \u201cold-fashioned\u201d to bring up the sovereignty issue when South Korea has signed free trade agreements with several countries. \u201cSome media reports suggest that I yielded to the foreign envoys\u2019 pressure, but it is not true.

Kim Moo-sung. The former prime minister-designate noted Mapo was a \u201cspecial place\u201d as he attended middle school there. Oh, on the other hand, said he decided to stick to his original plan of running in Jongno with sturdy conservative votes, despite chairman Kim\u2019s repeated offer for him to run in a constituency unpopular among conservative voters to compete with liberal bigwigs such as former main opposition leader Rep. Kim Han-gil.  Oh Se-hoon (Yonhap)\u201cWhen I returned to politics in April, I set up three principles -- contributing to the party\u2019s election victory, refusing to seek an easy win and running for a significant place. I think Jongno is the place that best serves my principles,\u201d said the former mayor in a press conference.Ahn\u2019s potential rival Chung is a veteran fifth-term lawmaker and had served as chairman of the Minjoo Party\u2019s forerunner Uri Party. Oh's prospective contender\u00a0Noh is the\u00a0second-term lawmaker and\u00a0incumbent representative of his constituency.The election bids, meanwhile, caused a backlash from other prospective candidates\u00a0Park Jin and Kang Seung-kyu, the former lawmakers who had previously been elected from Jongno and Mapo, respectively. Park and Kang are expected to challenge the two bigwigs during the in-house nomination contest.\u00a0Kang\u2019s supporters attended Ahn\u2019s press conference, shouting protests against his decision. Kang also held his own press briefing, accusing Ahn of choosing the easy way out by running on his turf and demanding the party leadership hold a strict internal primary to pick the candidate.\u00a0Park, who has been elected from Jongno three times, dismissed the former mayor\u2019s bid as a scheme to reinforce his status as a presidential hopeful and denounced Oh for making zero contribution to the constituents. Mindful of escalating tit-for-tat among the party\u2019s election candidates, the party leader Kim reiterated his rule on the nomination. He promised to forgo his authority to nominate the election candidates and allow voters themselves to determine the candidates.\u201cI respect each candidate\u2019s decision. The Saenuri Party will nominate candidates for the elections in accordance with the nomination rule and a fair and transparent competition among candidates,\u201d said Kim in a text message sent to reporters.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","870":"A total of 2,740 maritime accidents involving ships occurred last year, resulting in 112 deaths and missing persons, government data showed Wednesday.The number of accidents last year was double the annual average of 1,367 for the previous three years, according to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security.The ministry also said the number of deaths is higher than the annual average that ranged from 67-85 in the 2011- 2013 period.\u00a0It said, however, last year's fatality numbers were far lower than the annual average of 212 reached in the 2012-2014 period.\u00a0\u00a0In April 2014, more than 300 people died when the Sewol ferry carrying 476 people on board sank off the southwestern coast of the country. The disaster pushed up the national average.According to the ministry, the rapid increase in the number of maritime accidents is largely blamed on poor maintenance of vessels and equipment.Accidents from poor maintenance rose to 854 ships last year from 377 in 2014, while those due to using faulty equipment sharply increased to 676 ships from the previous year's 305.Also accidents involving vessels that drifted due to empty fuel tanks shot up to 224 from 104 the previous year.By type of vessel, fishing boats accounted for most of the accidents, at 1,566, followed by water leisure crafts at 324 incidents, and tugboats and barges at 145.With the rise in the number of maritime accidents, the safety ministry plans to organize what it calls a vessel safety consultative body to make prompt and follow-up measures after maritime accidents.Meanwhile, the Coast Guard will also start operating a mobile maritime safety corps by the end of May to crack down on vessels operating without properly working transceivers, navigating under the influence of alcohol and fishing in off-limit areas.

Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)Moon and Ahn failed to work out differences over how to reform their party, which led to Ahn\u2019s departure.Moon has since changed the name of the main opposition party to the Minjoo Party of Korea in an apparent move to improve its image before the general elections in April.Ahn, who is seeking to create a new political party, is trailing behind by receiving 13 percent of support in the poll while Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party, received 12 percent of support.The survey was conducted on 1,005 adults between Tuesday and Thursday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. (Yonhap)","872":"Ulsan\u2019s south district office mapped out a plan Friday to enhance the welfare of dolphins locked in the city\u2019s aquarium amid escalating criticism from environmental groups of its attempt to cover up their deaths.\u00a0(Yonhap)Apologizing for hiding a series of deaths of dolphins at the city\u2019s Whale Life Experience Museum, the office vowed to improve the living conditions for dolphins in captivity and temporarily suspend their import from Japan. Under the plan, it will make the conditions in the tanks similar to the wild by installing artificial rocks and marine plants. It will invest in developing a program to study dolphins\u2019 behavior and help them live as they do in the wild. Dolphin shows, in which spectators can feed the marine mammals, will be reduced in frequency from four times a day to three. It also promised to raise the number of dolphin trainers and enhance the animals\u2019 medical check-ups.But the district office refused to shut down the life experience museum, citing its role in educating children about the environment and promoting Jangsengpo, the heartland of Korea\u2019s whaling industry.Animal rights groups on Friday held a press conference in central Seoul, taking a swipe at the district office for offering \u201cinsufficient\u201d solutions to the problem. \u201cDolphins, which move about 160 km a day, are not animals that can be artificially trained and fed in small tanks. No matter how much the conditions of the tanks are improved, the dolphins cannot help but die young due to physical and mental stress,\u201d the Korea Animal Welfare Association said in a statement. \u201cHundreds of dolphins are cruelly slaughtered in the blood-covered sea to be sold to Korea. The district office should drop its bid to import more dolphins and make it clear that it will permanently stop importing dolphins from Japan,\u201d it added. The dolphins imported from Japan come from the town of Taiji, Wakayama, notorious for the fishermen\u2019s cruel methods of hunting whales. They allegedly pound on metal poles to disorient dolphins and herd them into shallow water to be killed. An estimated 2,000 dolphins are killed each year, according to animal rights groups. The district office\u2019s plan came after three environmental groups including Korea Animals Welfare Association and Hot Pink Dolphins filed a complaint with the prosecution against three officials respectively from the district office, whale museum and state-run city management organization for covering up the deaths of two dolphins inside the aquarium last year. \u201cBig Dolphins, which are on the brink of extinction, are monitored by the Ministry of Environment. The accused obstructed justice by not properly being aware of the dolphins\u2019 death and problems of the facilities,\u201d they said.\u00a0They also denied the deaths of dolphins to the local media fearing a public backlash, the groups said. Two dolphins imported from Japan died in 2010 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, a dolphin calf died 65 hours after birth. Last year, a young dolphin died of pneumonia on June 6, days after birth, and a male dolphin died of blood poisoning in August after it scuffled with a fellow dolphin.

Security Council to punish the North for its fourth nuclear test last week.Choi Kyung-soo, president of the North Korea Resources Institute in Seoul, noted the North's high reliance on trade with China.\"Coal exports account for nearly half of all North Korean exports to China,\" he said in a phone interview with Yonhap News Agency. North Korea earned $2.84 billion from exports to China in 2014, nearly 90 percent of the $3.16 billion earned in total, according to data from the institute and the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency.Coal made up some 40 percent of exports to China at $1.14 billion.If China boycotts North Korean coal, the North's leader Kim Jong-un will likely have trouble raising the funds necessary to run the country and build its nuclear and missile arsenal, Choi said.Without Chinese demand, North Korea's mining industry could also suffer, leading to the collapse of a major sector supporting the country's economy. This could fuel public unrest with many miners not being paid wages.\"It won't be easy for the Chinese government to decide to stop coal imports because it will have to find a substitute to prevent causing a disruption to the production of Chinese firms,\" Choi said.Still, China could cite its economic stagnation and stricter international environmental standards to ban or limit North Korean coal imports, he said.Despite China's stated goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, many analysts are skeptical that it will strengthen sanctions on the North because it wants to keep Pyongyang as a buffer against American troops in U.S.-backed South Korea.

Seoul and Washington have raised doubts about the credibility of the North's claim.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un awarded state commendations on Tuesday to nuclear scientists, technicians and officials for their contributions to \"demonstrating the dignity and might\" of North Korea, according to the Korean Central News Agency.The KCNA said Wednesday that Kim called for \"bolstering up both in quality and quantity the nuclear force capable of making nuclear strikes\" on the United States \"any time and in any space.\" (Yonhap)","877":"The chief nuclear envoys of South Korea and China are to meet in Beijing later Thursday as Seoul puts pressure on China to help punish North Korea over its recent nuclear test.Since the North's fourth nuclear test last week, South Korea has stepped up diplomatic efforts to win international support for a strong U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution.China has condemned the North's test but maintained its calls for restraint and dialogue in dealing with Pyongyang.Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea's special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, left for Beijing earlier in the day to meet with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei.\"China is a permanent member of the Security Council, with the largest influence on North Korea,\" he told reporters at Incheon International Airport before boarding his plane. \"I believe it's the most important country in responding to the current situation.\"The talks come a day after President Park Geun-hye publicly urged China to play a \"necessary role\" in drawing up strong sanctions against the North.China is believed to be the only country with power over Pyongyang, as it props up the ally's moribund economy.

The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods that, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make one bomb a year.The reactor has provided Pyongyang with weapons-grade plutonium that the regime used in its first three nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The North conducted its fourth nuclear test last week, claiming it successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.The reactor is believed to have been under retrofitting or upgrading in recent years.In addition to its plutonium program, the North has also built a uranium enrichment facility.ISIS said the enrichment plant is believed to be in operation as the imagery shows no snow on the roof of the plant. That is believed to be due to heating inside the building aimed at ensuring that the centrifuge functions correctly, it said.The North has also been building a light water nuclear reactor, but ISIS said that the satellite imagery showed no indications that it is in operation.(Yonhap)","880":"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pledged Wednesday to cooperate on the U.N.'s move to deal with North Korea's latest nuclear test, Seoul's foreign ministry said.Lavrov delivered the message in a telephone conversation with his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se.He was quoted as saying that Moscow agrees to the seriousness of the North's nuclear weapons development.He added Russia will actively participate in consultations at the U.N.

They also asked the court to order Park to pay 270 million won -- 30 million won for each of the victims -- in compensation for defamation. In February last year, the court ordered Park to delete a total of 34 sections in the book which \"defamed\" the surviving victims. The original version of the book had been banned from being sold since then. The professor, who attended college in Japan and received her Ph.D. in Japanese literature from Waseda University, has been claiming that she had no reason to defame the surviving victims, and that she wanted to give a more nuanced analysis of the particular history.Park is also on trial on the criminal charge of defaming the victims.

The broadcasts reportedly include messages promoting its leader Kim Jong-un and criticism of President Park Geun-hye.Though the reclusive regime\u2019s loudspeakers are too outdated to blare the message into the South, some cross-borders residents, such as those living on Gwanghwado Island, reportedly heard messages such as, \u201cThe power of the people and the military with a hydrogen bomb is unmatched.\u201dGiven that the North\u2019s loudspeakers are not clearly audible \u2014 they were said to make buzzing sounds \u2014 sources said that the loudspeaker campaign would also serve as a distraction for its own residents from anti-regime propaganda, such as the smearing of Kim Jong-un. Compared to the South\u2019s devices, whose sound output can reach as far as 20 kilometers beyond the border, the North\u2019s sound output is said to be half that. The North\u2019s loudspeakers were also said to be vulnerable to power outages.\u00a0 Marines in Gwanghwa island patrol along the cross-border region.

Seoul had halted the psychological campaign since last August upon the inter-Korean agreement that was reached after Pyongyang\u2019s land mine attack earlier in the month. Under the deal, South Korea agreed to suspend the loudspeaker broadcasts \u201cunless any abnormal situation takes place.\u201d The North had called the broadcast a threat to its regime as they contrast the North\u2019s economic suffering with the South\u2019s achievements in democracy and economy. \u201cUnder the Aug. 25 agreement, we are entitled to resume the loudspeaker campaign if the North engages in abnormal activities,\u201d spokesman Kim said in a media interview. \u201cI think we should continue the campaign until the North corrects its violations.

(Yonhap)","891":"Growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea have stirred debate in the United States about a topic that has long been considered too nonsensical to even talk about: South Korea going nuclear.American security experts have recently published articles making emphatic cases either for allowing Seoul to seek its own nuclear deterrent or for greater efforts to reassure the Asian ally so as to dissuade it from such a temptation. That appears to suggest that the U.S. may be beginning to feel real concern that Seoul's nuclear option can no longer be simply dismissed as nonsense as the North keeps pushing forward with its nuclear and long-range missile programs.\"Policymakers should consider the possibility of a nuclear South Korea,\" Doug Bandow, a Korea expert and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in an article contributed to the Huffington Post. \"Keeping America entangled in the Korean imbroglio as Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons is a bad option which could turn catastrophic. Blessing allied development of nuclear weapons might prove to be a better alternative,\" he said.Bandow warned that Washington's \"commitment to the much more populous and prosperous\" South Korea likely will decline as America's finances worsen and challenges elsewhere multiply, and that Seoul could find itself ill-prepared to deter the North.After the North's fourth nuclear test last week, some members of South Korea's ruling party called for deployment of nuclear weapons in the country. But the government dismissed the idea, saying it runs counter to the principle of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.Bandow said that public support in South Korea for a nuclear option is also on the upswing.\"Like Japan, the ROK could develop a weapon quickly if it chose to do so, perhaps in a matter of months,\" he said.Bandow also compared the situation in Northeast Asia to \"gun control in the U.S.: only the bad guys end up armed.\" China, Russia, and North Korea all have nuclear weapons while America's allies, Japan and South Korea, do not, and expect Washington to defend them, he said.\"South Korea and Japan are important international partners, but their protection is not worth creating an unnecessary existential threat to the American homeland,\" he said. \"Indeed, the potential price of initiating nuclear war actually reduces the credibility of Washington's commitment and thus its deterrent value.\"Faced with the prospect of Japanese and South Korean nuclear weapons, he also argued that China could come to see the wisdom of applying greater pressure on the North -- most importantly, cutting off energy and food shipments to the recalcitrant neighbor.He called late former South Korean President Park Chung-hee's pursuit of nuclear weapons \"prescient.\"\"Maybe it's time for the good guys in Northeast Asia to be armed as well,\" he said.Brad Glosserman, executive director of the Pacific Forum, a program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and senior fellow David Santoro, contributed an article to the Wall Street Journal, calling for greater U.S. efforts to end \"South Korea's nuclear temptation.\"\"South Koreans are frustrated. They feel powerless against yet another round of North Korean provocations, and their frustration has driven some mainstream politicians, with considerable public support, to champion a strategy once advanced only on the fringe: acquiring nuclear weapons,\" they said.In response, nonproliferation experts and officials only trot out the usual arguments that it's a bad idea because it will hurt the country's economy, security and international status, and further entrench the nuclear problem on the peninsula and could lead Japan or Taiwan to reconsider their nuclear options.\"Yet it's pointless merely to explain why these are bad choices. South Koreans need suggestions that would relieve their mounting frustration,\" they said. \"While no solution would be total, the only long-term remedy is the restoration of some South Korean control over matters involving their security and the diplomatic agenda.\"They stressed that Seoul should be allowed to take the initiative toward addressing the North Korean problem, saying it will make South Koreans feel that they are in control, rather than dependent on U.S. and Chinese decisions.Giving Seoul more leadership roles is the best way to quell growing calls for nuclear weapons, they said.\"U.S. strategists often mechanically seek to strengthen deterrence of adversaries like North Korea to reassure allies that they don't need their own nuclear weapons,\" they said. \"But a more sophisticated strategy is required, starting with a clearer understanding of why allies are tempted to begin with. Without that, U.S. allies may one day go nuclear, with South Korea leading the pack,\" they said.Bennett Ramberg, a security expert, said in a column contributed to the Reuters that a South Korean decision to go nuclear would pit the country against its crucial ally, Washington, which \"doggedly opposes nuclear proliferation whether by friend or foe.\"He also said that bringing tactical U.S. nuclear weapons back into the South would also raise a host of additional questions, such as whether it would enhance deterrence or make Pyongyang more trigger happy, whether it would provide Seoul enough reassurance to eliminate any inclination to go nuclear and how China will react to the re-deployment.\"These open questions deserve robust public debate in the United States and South Korea,\" he said. (Yonhap)","892":"Ending North Korea's nuclear programs remains the \"paramount goal\" of the U.S. policy on Pyongyang and will be the \"focus\" of any talks with the communist nation, the State Department said Tuesday.The statement clears up questions about the U.S. commitment to pursue denuclearization ahead of anything else, after spokesman John Kirby said last week the U.S. does not rule out the possibility of a \"parallel process\" by which it holds peace treaty talks with the North in tandem with denuclearization negotiations.Signing a peace treaty, which would replace the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War, has been one of Pyongyang's long-running goals, but the U.S. and South Korea have demanded the North abandon its nuclear program first.The issue resurfaced recently as China proposed to pursue peace treaty talks and denuclearization negotiations with North Korea at the same time as a way to defuse tensions heightened in the wake of the North's nuclear and missile tests.\"The paramount goal of U.S. policy on North Korea has been and remains the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner,\" State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams said in response to a query from Yonhap News Agency.Adams said the U.S. has consistently told Pyongyang that it remains open to authentic and credible negotiations based on the agreement reached with all members of the six-party talks in September 2005, in which the North promised to give up its nuclear program in exchange for political and economic concessions.\"We have insisted that denuclearization remain the focus of any talks, and we have made clear that the DPRK's complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization is our overriding priority,\" she said.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. The U.S. and South Korea have demanded that Pyongyang first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments in order for the talks to reopen, but the North has refused to do so.

You'd better straighten it out.' And, if you don't straighten it out, we're going to have trouble because we have power over China. We have trade power over China.\"Trump also said that while Iran is expected to have nuclear weapons due to what he calls a \"stupid agreement\" that the U.S. and other world powers concluded with Tehran last year, North Korea already has \"very dangerous weapons of some sort.\"In another FOX TV interview, Trump again said that China is the one that should fix the North Korea problem.\"People ask me a number of questions. They were asking me how do you solve North Korea? Well, China should be solving North Korea; they have total power,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"I say we can beat them so badly; we have such power over China with trade because we have rebuilt China. They have taken so much out of our economy in terms of money that we can -- we have a lot power over China. They should solve the North Korea problem,\" he said.Last week, Trump said that the U.S. should be very tough with China on trade unless it cooperates in reining in the North, even claiming that the U.S. can have China collapse \"in about two minutes.\"Trump again repeated his unfounded criticism that South Korea is getting a defense free ride from the U.S. while paying only \"peanuts\" for the upkeep of the 28,500 American troops stationed in the country to help defend against the North.\"I order thousands, and thousands of televisions a year. They're all made in South Korea, whether it's Samsung, LG; they're made in South Korea. Every time I order, South Korea gets huge checks, right?\" Trump said.\"They're a monster. They are absolutely a behemoth in terms of economics. An economic behemoth. Now, we're sitting there with 28,000 soldiers on our line between North Korea and South Korea. We get paid almost nothing. We get paid peanuts. We're not being paid,\" he said.The presence of U.S. troops in South Korea is a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula still technically at war, and Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces.\u00a0In 2014, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China. (Yonhap)","894":"Crimes committed by senior citizens are expected to increase this year mainly due to financial difficulties, despite the decrease in the overall crime rate, a police-affiliated think tank said Sunday.The Police Science Institute, operated under the state-run Korean National Police University, predicted that Korea\u2019s high elderly poverty rate would result in more crimes by underprivileged senior citizens aged 61 or older. According to \u201cPensions at a Glance 2015\u201d by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 49.5 percent of Koreans aged 65 or more are below the poverty line, by far the highest rate among OECD member states at more than quadruple the OECD average. The OECD defines the poverty line as half the median household income of the total population.\u201cAs poverty of the senior citizens persists, the \u2018subsistence crime\u2019 \u2015 committed by the underprivileged for the sheer purpose of survival \u2015 will continue to grow. There is also a high possibility that the increase in crimes will lead to more violent cases, such as sex crimes,\u201d the officials said.The report pointed out that the surge in the crime rate was most notable among the age group of 61 or more last year. Criminal cases by the senior citizens accounted for 15.4 percent of the total population in 2014, marking a steep increase from 11.8 percent in 2011. In terms of the number of criminals, 150,902 seniors were convicted of crimes in 2014, according to the National Police Agency. This marked a 35.4 percent jump from 111,453 in 2011. The officials recommended that the elderly people should be given opportunities to participate in various government-funded programs, while the authorities should carry out campaigns to raise the awareness of the senior crimes. But the report forecast the number of crimes in 2016 to be around 1.79 million, down from 1.85 million in the year before.In addition, the PSI also predicted an increase in the number of crimes by foreigners, who account for 3.5 percent of the country\u2019s 51.5 million population. Crimes committed by foreigners went up from 22,543 in 2010 to 30,684 in 2014, and slid to 28,114 as of September 2015. The number of foreigners had also increased by roughly 700,000 since 2009 to mark 1.82 million. The report pointed out that many foreign workers suffer from poor working conditions, being exempt from most welfare measures.It added that while the situation calls for a \u201ccustom-fit\u201d policy to counter the increase in crimes by foreigners, a special caution is needed against possible rise of xenophobia and contempt against foreign cultures in general. A report by Kim Jung-hyu, a professor of American Studies at Keimyung University, extrapolated from his study of 800 immigrants in Korea that distortion, discrimination and mistreatment were among the biggest factors that pushed the foreigners to crime.Among other crimes expected to surge this year were cases related to online feuds, as demonstrated by multiple libel cases involving an ultraconservative website \u201cIlbe\u201d last year, which included an Ilbe member\u2019s defamation of victims from 2014\u2019s fatal sinking of ferry Sewol. The PSI said that North Korea will likely attempt to sway public opinion during the general elections in April of this year, as it claimed that Pyongyang has schemed against certain parties and candidates in all major domestic elections It said Pyongyang\u2019s cyberoperations team would attempt to spread false rumors and propaganda against the major government policies such as labor reform and the government monopolizing publication of history textbooks, which has received heavy criticism from the opposition, labor circles and education circles across the country.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","895":"With fewer than 100 days until South Korea holds its April general elections, debates have erupted regarding whether or not the ruling party can seize a supermajority status in the National Assembly.The ruling Saenuri Party has reiterated that it would win 180 out of the 300 parliamentary seats, a number that allows the party to pass contentious legislation without reaching a consensus with the minor ones. According to the National Assembly Act Articles 85 and 86, pending bills cannot be put to a vote in the plenary session without the approval of three-fifths of the attending lawmakers. The Saenuri Party holds 156 seats and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea has 118.\u201cThough it sounds a bit ambitious, we should aim to secure more than 180 seats,\u201d ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung said last Monday. \u201c(This number) is needed to neutralize the parliamentary law that paralyzes the nation. \u2026 If the ruling bloc remains united, we will surely win the election,\u201d said Kim.\u00a0Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. YonhapHistory, however, has played out against the ruling party\u2019s hopes. Never in the past 20 years has a single political party gained 180 seats. The Grand National Party, the precursor to the Saenuri Party, took 121 and 133 seats in 2004 and 2000, respectively, before peaking at 153 seats in 2008 and, as the Saenuri Party, winning 152 seats in 2012. Meanwhile, the then-ruling Uri Party and Millennium Democratic Party won 115 and 152 seats in 2000 and 2004. A splintered liberal bloc took 89 seats in 2008 while the Minjoo Party\u2019s forerunner Democratic United Party gained 127 seats in 2012. But there is one big difference in the upcoming elections: the emergence of an undivided conservative bloc. Unlike in the past elections when the right wing was divided, the 2016 election is highly likely to pit the single conservative Saenuri Party against multiple liberal opposition parties.Mathematically, such conditions could set the stage for the Saenuri Party\u2019s supermajority. In the 2008 elections, conservative parties attracted a cumulative 197 seats. The number was well past the 180 mark and even near 200 seats, with which the majority party can unilaterally pursue constitutional change.The scenario was even cautioned by the opposition\u2019s presidential hopeful. \u201cOur primary goal is to prevent the Saenuri Party from seizing more than 200 seats,\u201d said Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, an independent lawmaker who seeks to create a third party that could rival the Saenuri Party in the elections.The National Assembly. YonhapSome experts noted that the Saenuri Party would secure 180 seats in the elections, if the ruling party remains united and the opposition remains fragmented.Since Ahn left the main opposition Minjoo Party last month, his up-and-coming party has threatened the Minjoo\u2019s foothold. According to the survey released by local pollster Realmeter on Monday, the Minjoo\u2019s approval rating is 23.6 percent with Ahn\u2019s party recording 17.3 percent. \u201cIt is all about how much impact Ahn\u2019s new party will have. If it grows as big as the Minjoo Party, the Saenuri Party can play both ends against the middle and come out the winner with more than 180 seats,\u201d said politics professor Yoon Sung-yi at Kyung Hee University.Bae Jong-chan, senior analyst of Research and Research, downplayed the likelihood of the Saenuri Party winning a supermajority. He noted that the 180-seat goal is hardly achievable, unless both the Saenuri Party and President Park Geun-hye\u2019s approval ratings rise above 50 percent and Ahn\u2019s new party\u2019s rating falls below 10 percent. According to the Realmeter poll, the Saenuri Party earned approval ratings of 38.6 percent while 42.5 percent of respondents described Park\u2019s job performance as \u201cpositive.\u201d Both the numbers are below the 50 percent mark that the analyst cites as a requirement for the 180-seat victory. Meanwhile, some Saenuri heavyweights urged the party to take a more cautious approach. The fifth-term lawmaker Rep. Lee Jae-oh said the voters are not \u201cnaive\u201d enough to give the ruling party an election victory with 180 or 200 seats.Lee Chung-hee, politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, echoed the warning. \u201cGiven the voter\u2019s frustration over the politics, the ruling party should tell them about its solution to address the issue. Touting the number of seats they want to get in elections doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d he said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","896":"Various diplomatic missions in Korea issued statements denouncing North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test last Wednesday, indicating their resolve to step up sanctions.

President Park Geun-hye speaks during a meeting with educational circles on Friday. (Yonhap)During their telephone talks last Thursday, the day after the North\u2019s self-proclaimed hydrogen bomb tests, President Park Geun-hye and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed to cooperate on pushing for \u201cstrong and comprehensive\u201d sanctions against the North.\u201cComprehensive\u201d sanctions underscored the allies\u2019 resolve to adopt stronger punitive measures against the North, considering that the international community has recently been favoring \u201csmart sanctions\u201d that target specific entities or individuals of a country, rather than applying comprehensive sanctions that could also have an impact on the general populace of the country.In line with their agreement to toughen anti-Pyongyang sanctions, the allies were seen stepping up diplomatic efforts to ensure that the U.N. Security Council adopts a fresh resolution of tougher sanctions.\u00a0\u00a0The new resolution is expected to strengthen the existing sanctions such as arms embargoes, interdiction of North Korea-related cargo, financial sanctions and sanctions on particular individuals or entities including North Korean enterprises.Given that the UNSC sanctions require the endorsement of 15 council member nations, possibilities remain that some members including a veto-wielding China, the North\u2019s traditional ally, could oppose an application of what they may regard as excessive sanctions.Seoul is thus expected to seek an application of tougher bilateral sanctions as well, in tandem with the U.S.\u00a0One of the bilateral sanctions the U.S. could impose is the so-called \u201csecondary boycott,\u201d which would sanction any businesses or financial institution of a third country that engages in financial transactions with the North.\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. had applied the secondary boycott to Iran to bring the Islamic Republic out for negotiations over its controversial nuclear program.The U.S. could also seek to relist the North as state sponsor of terrorism, subjecting it to a set of economic sanctions, observers noted.Expectations have also been raised that Seoul and Washington could push for the so-called BDA-type sanctions that the U.S. slapped on the North in 2005. Washington sanctioned the Macau-based Banco Delta Asia bank, which managed some $25 million for Pyongyang, for purportedly helping the North launder illegally earned money.Some observers, however, said the BDA sanctions might not work this time, as the North has altered the way it manages its leader\u2019s overseas funds to neutralize the effect of any such financial sanctions.Above all, the most crucial player for anti-Pyongyang sanctions is China, as it wields the greatest influence over the North that is heavily dependent on it for trade and various forms of aid including the supply of oil.\u00a0The trade volume between China and the North has accounted for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s overseas trade. The North is also known to secure 99 percent of oil from China through a pipeline linking Dandong in northeastern China and the North\u2019s border city of Sinuiju.China has so far opposed the North\u2019s latest nuclear test. But it has so far maintained that the nuclear issue should be settled through \u201cdialogue,\u201d particularly via the six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia, which have been dormant since late 2008.After the North\u2019s second and third nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013, China reportedly reduced its oil supply to the North. Following the second atomic test, China also suspended its trade with the North for four months from August 2009.\u00a0However, it remains to be seen whether China will take harsh steps that would potentially trigger a collapse of the North Korean regime. Beijing has long preferred to maintain stability in the North as any instability could undermine its own security interests and complicate efforts to address China\u2019s internal issues.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","898":"North Korea would be able to deploy a submarine-launched ballistic missile within three to four years -- one year earlier than previously expected -- as it has repeatedly conducted tests on the underwater weapons system, Seoul\u2019s military authorities said Saturday.But they noted that the video footage of a recent SLBM ejection test -- aired last Friday by the North\u2019s official Korean Central Television -- seems to have been manipulated.

We believe that they have yet to reach a stage where they can conduct a SLBM flight test.\u201dWith the North focusing its \u201cnational-level\u201d energy on developing the SLBM, the reclusive regime would be able to accelerate the development of the formidable weapons system, he added.\u00a0\u00a0Security allies Seoul and Washington have been closely watching Pyongyang\u2019s push for the SLBM development, which could pose a higher level of nuclear threat to the security on the peninsula and beyond.Pyongyang is seen to have conducted SLBM tests in May, November and December, through which it is thought to have upgraded the underwater weapons technology.\u00a0Fears about the SLBM stem from the North\u2019s potential \u201csecond-strike capability\u201d to launch a sudden nuclear retaliation if it suffers a \u201cfirst strike\u201d from enemy forces.The second-strike capability forms the basis of a condition referred to as \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d that maintained the \u201cbalance of terror\u201d between the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War. SLBMs are at the core of the capability as submarines can launch targeted surprise attacks on enemy forces.\u201cThe SLBM is the ultimate, the most formidable form of nuclear arms -- a reason why people call it a true game changer,\u201d said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.\u201cWhen the submarine carrying these missiles cruise deep underwater, it is virtually impossible to detect.

According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the ratio of flu-suspected patients per 1,000 outpatients in the country reached 10.6 from Dec. 28 to Jan. 2. This is higher by 1.6 from the previous week and about 3 points higher on-year. The disease control agency conducted an influenza sample test at 200 medical institutions on patients who showed symptoms of coughing, sore throat and fever of over 38 degrees Celsius. Unlike the common cold, flu patients have fever, chills, headache and muscle pain along with respiratory symptoms such as coughing and a sore throat. Based on the test results, the agency set the threshold of flu epidemic this winter at 11.3 patients per 1,000 individuals. If the ratio exceeds 11.3, it will issue a flu epidemic alert, the authorities said. Moreover, the ratio of flu-suspected patients aged between 7 and 18 already soared to 16.8, up by 28 percent in a week. Among those aged 20 to 40, the ratio reached 12.4. While the incidence of flu is currently limited to Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province, it is likely to further spread to other regions as the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus was officially detected last week at a hospital in South Jeolla Province, they added.Doctors normally recommend that people get vaccinated around October and November, a month before the flu season.The elderly aged 65 or older can get free vaccines at public health centers.

On Aug. 20, however, it fired shells at the South Korean side of the DMZ, which resulted in a brief exchange of fire between the two sides. (Yonhap)","901":"N. Korean leader Kim Jong-un says H-bomb test 'self-defensive'North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says its claimed hydrogen bomb test last week was an act of self-defense and a \"fair action that nobody can criticize,\" the North's state media said Sunday.The North claimed Wednesday it successfully conducted an H-bomb test for the first time, in defiance of United Nations' resolutions.\"The DPRK's H-bomb test, conducted at the outset of the year ... is a self-defensive step for reliably defending the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the regional security from the danger of nuclear war caused by the U.S.-led imperialists,\" Kim was quoted as saying by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency.DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.He was speaking to the Ministry of People's Armed Forces at an event for the new year, the KCNA said.South Korea and the U.S. say the blast observed last week is too weak to have originated from a full-fledged H-bomb.South Korea estimates the yield of Wednesday's test to be 6 kilotons, while H-bombs typically yield dozens, if not hundreds, of kilotons, according to nuclear experts.South Korea, Japan and the U.S. have said they will ramp up efforts to contain North Korea. China has also voiced its firm opposition to the North's test but denied responsibility in curbing its nuclear ambitions.\"The origin and frictions of the North Korean nuclear issue do not lie in China. The key to resolving the issue does not lie in China,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.On Friday, South Korea restarted its loudspeaker broadcasts against the North, which had been halted for about four months. South Korea had broadcasted anti-North messages along the inter-Korean border after an explosion of a land mine planted by the North maimed two South Korean soldiers in August. The broadcasts were stopped after the two sides reached a rare agreement to diffuse military tensions on the peninsula later that month. (Yonhap)","902":"South Korea restarted propaganda broadcasts Friday along its border with North Korea, two days after Pyongyang tested a nuclear bomb.Military tensions are expected to escalate on the peninsula as the North is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its leadership and system.Seoul's move came on the purported birthday of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, known to be in his early 30s.The South's military carried out the psychological campaign using loudspeakers for weeks last year in retaliation for the North's land mine attack.The North described it as an act of war and threatened direct strikes at related facilities.The crisis ended with the Aug. 25 inter-Korean deal calling for the South to halt the broadcasts in return for some of the North's conciliatory measures, including the reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.At that time, Seoul said it would resume the broadcasts in case of \"abnormal\" situations.The broadcasts began to blare sharp criticism of the Kim regime and its human rights abuses, as well as a narrative of South Korea's achievements and even K-pop songs, from 11 locations along the Demilitarized Zone. The messages reach North Korean regions more than 10 kilometers away in daytime and some 24 km at night, according to a defense source. South Korean officials expect their decision to demonstrate Seoul's resolve to deal sternly with the North's provocation, with the U.N. Security Council planning to impose additional sanctions on it.Pyongyang has not yet issued any formal response to Seoul's move.The South's Defense Ministry said it was maintaining the WATCHCON alert at the current level.The North's military is in a winter training period, and it is strengthening surveillance and its combat posture in some front-line areas, a ministry official said.If North Korea attacks the loudspeakers, we will immediately retaliate,\" he said, adding South Korea has deployed K-9 self-propelled artillery and short-range missiles near the loudspeakers.

They began their commercial operations in 2005.But they reported 50 safety accidents or defects last year, up from 32 cases in 2014.

(Yonhap)","905":"A newspaper published by China's ruling Communist Party on Friday blamed what it calls a \"hostile policy\" by South Korea, the United States and Japan toward North Korea for the North's fourth nuclear test. In an editorial, the state-run Global Times newspaper appeared to defend North Korea's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons, saying there will be \"no hope\" for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions unless South Korea, the U.S. and Japan change their policy toward the North. All eyes are on the role of China, which keeps North Korea's moribund economy afloat, after Pyongyang announced it conducted a \"successful\" test of a hydrogen bomb that marked the isolated regime's fourth nuclear test since 2006. The Wednesday test is seen as a diplomatic failure by Chinese President Xi Jinping of trying to rein in the key ally. While China has said it is \"firmly opposed\" to the nuclear test, Beijing's leadership has been reluctant to use more leverage over Pyongyang because it could lead to the North's collapse and instability on its border. \"The root causes of the North Korean nuclear issue are very complicated. For one thing, the North Korean regime has chosen the wrong path for security, and for another, the U.S. has persistently stuck to a hostile policy toward North Korea,\" the editorial reads. \"There is no hope to put an end to the North Korean nuclear conundrum if the U.S., South Korea and Japan do not change their policies toward Pyongyang,\" it said. \"Solely depending on Beijing's pressure to force the North to give up its nuclear plan is an illusion.\" During a telephone discussion on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, \"There cannot be business as usual\" after North Korea's fourth nuclear test. Kerry said he reached the agreement with Wang, after making clear to his Chinese counterpart that the latest nuclear test has proven that Beijing's approach to the North Korean nuclear issue \"has not worked.\"In return, Wang stressed that China \"remains committed to achieving the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula,\" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a brief statement. (Yonhap)","906":"Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio called Thursday for putting North Korea back on to the U.S. list of states sponsoring terrorism in response to the communist nation's fourth nuclear test.\"We have to do everything we can to ensure that they have less money to spend on these sorts of programs. So that's why a state sponsor of terror, they should be returned to that list,\" Rubio said in an interview with Fox Business Network. \"They were once on that list. They were removed from that list as a concession. They need to be put back on,\" he said.Rubio also called for measures to \"go after the assets\"overseas of the North's leadership.North Korea was put on the U.S. terrorism sponsor list for the1987 midair bombing of a Korean Air flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the administration of former President George W.Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks. (Yonhap)","907":"The foreign ministers of South Korea and China will hold phone talks later Friday to discuss North Korea's latest nuclear test, the Foreign Ministry said.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, are scheduled to speak over the phone at 7 p.m. (local time), after a previously arranged phone call on Thursday was postponed at China's request, the ministry said in a text message to reporters.They are expected to discuss ways to deal with North Korea after its fourth nuclear test Wednesday, which Pyongyang claims was its first test of a hydrogen bomb far more destructive than a conventional atomic bomb.The issue has been brought to the U.N. Security Council. As it plans to impose additional sanctions on Pyongyang, Beijing's cooperation is crucial in the process.China, North Korea's key ally and benefactor, has reportedly been in a dilemma over how to handle the issue. While the North's growing nuclear arsenal poses a security threat, punishing Pyongyang, which shares a border with China, could destabilize the regime and cause a headache for Beijing.In phone talks Thursday, Yun and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the nuclear test as an unacceptable challenge to the international community and agreed to respond sternly to any provocations.The South Korean minister has yet to discuss the issue with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, but the two sides are in talks to arrange a suitable time, according to officials here.Yun spoke with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida shortly after the test on Wednesday.The five countries are members of the currently stalled six-party talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program. (Yonhap)","908":"North Korea imported $2.09 billion worth of luxury goods for three years under the Kim Jong-un regime despite United Nations sanctions banning the transfer of such goods to the country, a South Korean lawmaker said Thursday, citing Chinese customs data.Luxury goods, including certain kinds of jewelry, precious stones, carpets, yachts, luxury automobiles and racing cars, have been banned from transfer to North Korea under three U.N. Security Council resolutions adopted in response to the North's nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, and 2013.Still, North Korea continues to buy luxury items from China, Europe and Southeast Asia, Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the ruling Saenuri Party said, citing Chinese customs data on two-way trade with North Korea from 2012 to 2014.\"No strong sanction can stop North Korea's series of nuclear provocations,\" Yoon said, referring that Pyongyang has repeatedly skirted the sanctions.Noticeably, nearly $800 million worth of goods, mostly electronic gadgets, were imported to Pyongyang in 2014, compared to $644 million in 2013 and $645 million in 2012, the lawmaker said.In recent years, the communist country has especially bought more liquor, watches, handbags, cosmetics, jewelry and carpets, leading to a doubling of imports of luxury goods under the current leader, Kim Jong-un, from an average of $300 million under his father and former leader Kim Jong-il, who died in December 2011.Yoon said increasing imports of luxury goods was Kim's way of impressing senior party and military officials who form the core class that preserves the regime.

Security Council can adopt a resolution for strong sanctions on North Korea over its hydrogen bomb test, Cheong Wa Dae said.The two leaders also shared the view that the international community must make sure that North Korea pays the corresponding price for a nuclear test, the South Korean presidential office said.The 20-minute telephone conversation came a day after North Korea claimed it had succeeded in conducting a hydrogen bomb test.The North's test prompted the U.N. Security Council to hold an emergency session on Wednesday and to agree to immediately start work on a new sanctions resolution against North Korea. The council \"strongly condemns\" Pyongyang's latest nuclear test.North Korea has already been under U.N. sanctions for its three previous nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.Obama also vowed to take all necessary measures for the security of South Korea. Park expressed thanks to Obama for reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the security of South Korea, according to Cheong Wa Dae.In Washington, the White House said Obama reaffirmed the \"unshakeable U.S. commitment\" to South Korea's security, and the two leaders agreed to work together to forge a united and strong international response to North Korea's latest reckless behavior.\"The two leaders condemned the test and agreed that North Korea's actions constitute yet another violation of its obligations and commitments under international law, including several U.N.Security Council Resolutions,\" the White House said in a statement.Park and Obama also shared the need of coordinating a stance with China in dealing with North Korea's hydrogen bomb test.Chinese support is crucial in adopting a new resolution for sanctions as it is one of the veto-wielding five permanent members of the council. The four other members are the U.S., Britain, France and Russia.China is a traditional ally of North Korea and is believed to have significant leverage over North Korea, but Pyongyang's latest nuclear test showed that Beijing's influence is limited.The bilateral ties -- once described as being as close as \"lips and teeth\" -- have been strained over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear ambition.Also Thursday, South Korea plans to hold a new session of the National Security Council at the presidential office, Defense Minister Han Min-koo said.

Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.\"Dictators like Kim Jong-un don't take time outs, they take advantage when the U.S. looks away,\" he said. \"As Iran prepares to gain billions in sanctions relief, North Korea surely thinks it can intimidate the Obama administration into the same.\"Royce called for greater pressure on Pyongyang.\"This rogue regime has no interest in being a responsible state. It continues to starve its people while it works to advance nuclear, missile and cyber weapons that pose a direct threat to the U.S. and our allies,\" he said.North Korea announced earlier Wednesday that it has successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test, claiming that the test means \"a higher stage of the DPRK's development of nuclear force\" and that the country \"proudly joined the advanced ranks of nuclear weapons states possessed of even an H-bomb.\"The latest test marked the North's fourth nuclear test following three previous ones in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Three of the four tests happened while Obama was in office. The Obama administration has been accused of ignoring the North's nuclear problem as it's preoccupied with Middle Eastern issues.\"I have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama stood idly by,\" Republican presidential hopeful and Sen. Marco Rubio said in a statement.\"If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy,\" he said. \"Our enemies around the world are taking advantage of Obama's weakness. We need new leadership that will stand up to people like Kim Jong-un and ensure our country has the capabilities necessary to keep America safe.\" Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific affairs, also criticized the Obama administration for ignoring the problems, calling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un a \"forgotten maniac\" and \"madman.\"\"Events like this are a symptom of a failed foreign policy. The Obama administration's stance on Russia, Syria, and especially Iran have sent a clear message to dictators and despots around theworld: if you act badly enough, for long enough, this administration will reward your behavior,\" Gardner said in a statement.The senator also said that the testing of a hydrogen bomb would serve as a reminder of the danger posed to the world by \"this often-forgotten maniac who leads a government that grips to power by fear, intimidation, and murder,\" he said.Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said the North's nuclear program should be shut down before it's too late.\"You have this mad man over there who probably would use it and nobody talks to him, other than, of course, Dennis Rodman talked to him. That's about it. But nobody is talking to him whatsoever,\"\u00a0Trump said on FOX News.\"We've got to close it down because he's getting too close to doing something. Right now, he's probably got the weapons, but he doesn't have the transportation system. Once he has the transportation system, he's sick enough to use it,\" he said.Trump also called for greater efforts to get China to work harder to rein in the North, saying Beijing has \"total control\"over the North. Unless China cooperates, the U.S. should make trade very difficult with China, Trump said.Republican presidential hopeful and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina also slammed the U.S. policy on the North as failure.\"Of course North Korea would conduct a nuclear test after watching Iran willfully violate an agreement they just made without consequence of any kind from this administration,\" she said in a Facebook message. \"North Korea is yet another Hillary Clinton foreign policy failure. America cannot lead from behind.\"Meanwhile, Democratic presidential front-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for increasing pressure on the North.\"North Korea's goal is to blackmail the world into easing the pressure on its rogue regime,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"We can't give in to or in any way encourage this kind of bullying.Instead, we should increase pressure and send Pyongyang an unmistakable message that its nuclear brinksmanship won't succeed.\"Clinton also said that North Korea must have no doubt that the U.S. will \"take whatever steps are necessary to defend ourselves and our treaty allies, South Korea and Japan.\"She also said China \"must be more assertive in deterring the North's irresponsible actions.\" (Yonhap)","911":"The White House expressed doubts Wednesday about North Korea's claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test, saying the \"initial analysis is not consistent\" with Pyongyang's claims.\"The initial analysis that's been conducted of the events that were reported overnight is not consistent with North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at a press briefing.Earnest said there is \"nothing that's occurred in the last 24 hours\" that has caused the U.S. government to change its assessment of the North's technical and military capabilities. Last month when the North claimed the development of an H-bomb, the White House said its information \"calls into serious question those claims.\"\"You've probably seen by now the extensive independent analysis that's been done in the United States and in other countries that includes significant and understandable skepticism of the claims of the North Korean regime,\" Earnest said Wednesday.Still, Earnest said that the North's test is \"provocative and a flagrant violation of\" U.N. resolutions.He also reiterated the \"rock-solid\" U.S. commitment to the security of allies South Korea and Japan. \"What we want the North Koreans to do ... is we want the North Koreans to end their provocative acts both in the form of missile tests and nuclear tests, to commit to de-nuclearization and to demonstrate a commitment to pursuing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,\" Earnest said.\"We're not asking them to do that out of charity, we actually also believe that that would be in the interests of the North Korean people and certainly the broader region. And that was the goal of the six-party talks,\" he said.Earnest also said U.S. President Barack Obama plans to speak by phone with President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \"Obviously, consulting with our allies in the region and reiterating our steadfast commitment to their security is a priority at this time, and it's something that the president will do personally in his conversations with those two leaders,\" he said.National Security Advisor Susan Rice met with Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai to discuss the issue, and Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken will also be traveling to the region next week to discuss the situation with partners in the region, the spokesman said.\"I think all of it underscores what I was describing earlier, though, which is that the international community is united in our belief that the North Koreans need to end their provocative actions and commit to de-nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula,\" he said.U.S. nuclear experts also doubted North Korea's claims, saying its yield is too low to believe that such an advanced bomb, way more powerful than conventional nuclear weapons, has been detonated.\"It is likely that this was not a test of what in the popular literature is interpreted as an H-Bomb, namely a two -stage fission-fusion weapon developed by the major nuclear-weapon states capable of obtaining explosive yields of hundreds or thousands of kilotons,\" said David Albright, a nuclear expert heading the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington.South Korea's spy agency believes that the yield of Wednesday's test is 6 kilotons and a 4.8-magnitude temblor was detected. In comparison, the yield of the nuclear device North Korea tested in2013 was 7.9 kilotons and it caused a 4.9-magnitude earthquake.\"If North Korea had indeed tested this type of H-bomb, the device's yield would be expected to be many tens of kilotons, at least,\" Albright said.

It is a problem for all of us. It is a painful history to be remembered, not to pass on to the next generation,\u201d Rep. Choo told the crowd. \u201cI condemn the government that tries to erase the history and forces the victims to forget their pain.\u201d Portraying the deal as \u201ca disaster resulting from hopeless diplomacy,\u201d Rep. Shim of the minor Justice Party blasted the government for pushing for a settlement without consulting the National Assembly and the victims. In the diplomatic deal confirmed as \u201cfinal and irreversible\u201d by both countries, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered an apology and promised Japan would pay 1 billion yen ($8.4 million) to a foundation for the 46 surviving victims. In return, Seoul promised not to raise the issue again on the world stage if Japan fulfills its commitments, which sparked criticism that the deal did not properly represent the interests of the victims. Wada Yoshihiro, a 31-year-old Japanese student studying literature at Yonsei University, watched the demonstrators from a distance to signify his opposition to his own government. \u201dThe deal only reconfirmed how Japan has ignored the victims\u2018 voices. Japan argues the issue is now over, but it is not,\u201d he said, shivering in the biting cold. \u201cMy country committed wrongdoings and it should make an apology.\u201d\u201cRegardless of my nationality, I am here because I don\u2019t want to live in a world where this kind of humanitarian issue is ignored.\u201dThe Wednesday rally was joined by scores of separate demonstrations in 45 cities in 12 countries by those opposing the Korea-Japan deal across the globe. Earlier in the day, an association of 13 university student councils issued a joint statement slamming the authorities for ignoring the victims\u2019 demands. Some 32 heads of municipalities also called for renegotiations with Japan in a joint declaration. Since New Year\u2019s Eve, a group of students has staged an all-day sit-in outside the Japanese Embassy to prevent the authorities from relocating the comfort women statue. Under pressure from Tokyo, Seoul agreed to consider relocating the symbolic statue as part of the settlement.  (Yonhap)Some 40 members from six right-wing groups held a rally on the other side of the road in the afternoon to urge the comfort women and their supporters to accept Japan\u2019s apology, but there were no major clashes. \u201cThe comfort women issue was finally resolved. It is a diplomatic fruit to heal the scars of history and President Park Geun-hye\u2019s brave, future-oriented determination for the nation\u2019s interest,\u201d they said in a statement. The council for the victims, meanwhile, launched a campaign to collect signatures and donations to set up a statue representing comfort women in museums across the world in commemoration of the victims. It said it would continue to rally every Wednesday in front of comfort women statues across the nation until the victims\u2019 demands are properly addressed.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","915":"The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Wednesday it will embark on projects to restore and beautify a neighborhood of traditional Korean houses in central Seoul.The city government plans to build historic cultural streets in Seochon, or \"western village,\" which stretches out from the western wing of Gyeongbok Palace and stretches all the way up to the base of Mount Inwang.The plan is to enlarge the pedestrian passages from 1 meter to 4 meters, repave roads and restrict building heights in the area to maintain the view of the mountain.The metropolitan government also said it will introduce a certificate system for well-made hanok, or traditional Korean houses, this year with an aim to prevent the traditional assets from disappearing in the city.The city government said it plans to certify three hanoks as well as a total of 27 master artisans -- three each from nine different sectors -- related to the traditional housing style every year. The city said it will earmark 50 million won ($42,000) for the project.\"With the introduction of the certificate system, (we) will be able to lead the environment for high-class and high-quality hanok construction by providing exemplary models of Seoul's hanoks and inspire confidence and responsibility in artisans and those who possess certified hanok,\" the municipal government said.It will start developing the certification mark and standard for selection this month and complete the selection before the end of this year. (Yonhap)","916":"South Korea unveiled a slew of its own punitive measures against Pyongyang Tuesday, including blacklisting scores of North Koreans and entities suspected to be linked the North's weapons of mass destruction.The set of measures is a follow-up to newly-imposed United Nations Security Council sanctions in response to Pyongyang's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch last month, the Prime Minister's Office said.\"The government will cooperate with the international community to change North Korea by toughening our own sanctions against the country and by faithfully carrying out the UNSC resolution,\" Lee Suk-joon, the top official in charge of government policy coordination at the PMO, told reporters.Seoul's sanctions include blacklisting 38 North Korean officials and two foreigners, as well as 30 organizations, including 24 based in Pyongyang, that are involved in the North's nuke and missile programs.Noticeably, scores of people and entities involved in developing or transporting the WMDs, such as trade firms, were additionally added to the blacklist, marking the first time Seoul has taken such a step.\u00a0Among those on the list is Hong Sung-mu, deputy director handling munitions in the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, who is believed to have spearheaded the North's Jan. 6 nuke test.Kim Yong-chul, former director of the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau and allegedly responsible for the sinking of a South Korean warship and the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island, is also on the list.The Seoul government said the measure would ban people and organizations from making financial and property transactions with South Korean banks and freeze their assets here as well.Other punitive actions include prohibiting vessels that have traveled to North Korea in the past 180 days from entering South Korean waters.A total of 66 ships that visited North Korea subsequently sailed into South Korean ports last year, mostly carrying steel, the premier's office said.The move is aimed at faithfully enforcing the toughest-ever UNSC sanctions imposed last week that call for mandatory inspections of all cargo going into and out of North Korea and a ban on the exports of mineral resources, a major source of hard currency for the cash-strapped country.Seoul's list includes the individuals and entities already on separate lists of the U.S., the European Union and Japan.Also, the government will clamp down on North Korean products entering the country in line with Seoul's already imposed sanctions in May 2010 to punish the North for the sinking of a South Korean warship.The government said it will advise its citizens to not visit North Korean restaurants abroad, as the communist regime operates them to earn hard currency.\"The government will continue to make efforts to sanction and put pressure on North Korea by cooperating with the international community,\" Lee said. (Yonhap)","917":"South Korea has put its military on alert and beefed up surveillance of North Korea Wednesday after the communist country announced it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. \"Currently, our military is strengthening our vigilance and surveillance posture against North Korea,\" the Ministry of National Defense said in a brief note to the press.Earlier in the day, North Korea announced on its state-run broadcasting channel that North Korea's \"first hydrogen bomb test was successfully conducted.\" The news came about two hours after a 5.1-magnitude earthquake was registered near North Korea's nuclear test site in the northeastern region. \"Regarding the situation, South Korea and the United States are closely cooperating,\" the ministry said.In a 10-minute telephone conference with United States Forces Korea commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti earlier in the day, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lee Sun-jin ensured close collaboration with the U.S., a ministry official said.They plan to have another online meeting later in the day, he said. The ministry added it has also launched an emergency crisis management body over what could be the North's latest and fourth nuclear test. Meanwhile, a military expert well versed in the North's nuclear program questioned the validity of the country's claim of the hydrogen bomb test, citing seismic data.\"The scale of the latest nuclear test fell short of that of the third nuclear test (in 2013),\" the expert said. The local meteorological administration put the magnitude of the tremor resulted from the test at 4.8, which is less than the 4.9 magnitude registered in the previous nuclear test three years ago.The explosive power of a hydrogen bomb is up to 1,000 times stronger than that of an atomic bomb, and North Korea cannot afford a hydrogen bomb test inside the country, the expert stressed. Even if the tested bomb included hydrogen, it must have been a very low-end bomb, he said. (Yonhap)","918":"The failure by Seoul and Washington to curb the growth of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program drew heavy criticism Wednesday after the communist regime claimed to have successfully conducted a hydrogen bomb test.Seoul and Washington have so far focused on applying sanctions against Pyongyang\u2019s development of nuclear arms and missiles, and persistently called for \u201csincerity\u201d in its denuclearization commitments. President Barack Obama. AP-YonhapBut such a hardline stance has hitherto failed to lure Pyongyang for meaningful talks to at least freeze the regime\u2019s nuclear activities, allowing it to continue upgrading its nuclear technology, critics said.\u201cSo far, Seoul and Washington have focused on applying sanctions and putting pressure on the North, believing that it is unlikely to abandon its nuclear program,\u201d said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University.\u201cThey have also persistently demanded that the North should take pre-steps for the reopening of the denuclearization talks, although Pyongyang has itself suggested talks and made many fence-mending gestures.\u201d The U.S. has so far maintained a policy of what analysts called \u201cstrategic patience,\u201d which some derided as \u201cstrategic ignorance\u201d or even \u201cstrategic coma.\u201d Washington has been increasingly reluctant to engage with the North amid the deterioration of bilateral ties.After the breakup of the 2012 \u201cLeap Day\u201d deal between Washington and Pyongyang, the bilateral relationship was caught in a downward spiral. The deal, under which Pyongyang agreed to put a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests in return for 240,000 tons of nutritional assistance, was breached after the North fired a long-range rocket less than two months later -- an incident that deepened mutual distrust. Bilateral friction further increased in late 2014 when the U.S. blamed the North for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, and imposed fresh sanctions against it in retaliation for the alleged hacking.U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s abrupt mention of the collapse of the North Korean regime early in January 2015 fueled bilateral animosities, which analysts said made Pyongyang further step up efforts to secure what it calls self-deterrence measures.Amid the deterioration of ties, Pyongyang was seen moving to restore its ties with the U.S. through a set of proposals. Last year, Pyongyang called on Washington to stop its military exercise with Seoul in return for its moratorium on a nuclear test. But it was spurned by Washington.Pyongyang has also called for talks over a peace treaty with the U.S. to replace the current Armistice Agreement. But Washington has dismissed it as insincere, apparently viewing the proposal with suspicion that the reclusive regime might take advantage of it to expel U.S. forces in the South.With the presidential election slated for November, the U.S. policymakers are unlikely to pay more attention to the North Korean issue, analysts say, highlighting the need for Seoul to make more efforts to engage with the North and prevent it from further developing its nuclear program.In line with the U.S., Seoul has also maintained a tough stance over the North, calling for more sincerity from Pyongyang instead of its verbosity about improving bilateral ties. It has continued to maintain economic sanctions against the North and ratcheted up pressure on the North to give up its nuclear ambitions in cooperation with the U.S., China and other major powers.Seoul has so far focused its energy on the unification policy, but critics argue that the policy has given an impression that the South seeks to forcibly absorb the North into its democratic system, rather than seeking coexistence with the North. Pyongyang has called the policy \u201cill-intended.\u201dExperts say that Seoul should be more active in contriving more creative ways to bring the North out to the dialogue table and to resume the denuclearization process.\u201cSeoul has not been active enough to tackle the nuclear issue so far. The centerpiece of the North Korean problem is the nuclear issue, but it has not been effectively addressing the issue,\u201d said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.\u201cSeoul has long called for Pyongyang\u2019s sincerity. But the North cannot be trusted and has to be managed or taken care of. It should exert more efforts to persuade China and the U.S. to work out a coordinated resolution to the North Korean conundrum.\u201dSince early last year, Seoul has called for unconditional \u201cexploratory dialogue\u201d with Pyongyang, as the latter has rejected the offer for official multilateral denuclearization talks -- as Seoul and Washington have demanded that Pyongyang take sincere denuclearization steps.But the efforts have also failed due to bilateral distrust.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","919":"The U.S. Geological Survey reported Tuesday that an earthquake has taken place near North Korea's nuclear test site.USGS said the magnitude-5.1 quake occurred 49 kilometers from the North's northeastern city of Kilju, where the country's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is located, at 1:30 a.m. GMT on Wednesday. (Yonhap)","920":"Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se convened an emergency meeting Wednesday amid reports of an earthquake in North Korea seen as a possible nuclear test.China's earthquake center said the 4.9-magnitude earthquake is suspected to have been an explosion, raising the possibility the North conducted its fourth nuclear test.\"The Foreign Ministry is currently holding a meeting presided over by the minister to immediately determine the situation following the reports,\" a ministry official said. (Yonhap)","921":"North Korea conducted another ejection test of a ballistic missile from a submarine last month, but it was apparently unsuccessful, a South Korean military official said Wednesday.\"We have determined that North Korea conducted a submarine-launched ballistic missile ejection test last month,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.It seems that the test ended up a failure, he said, adding that it is expected to take \"considerable time\" for the secretive communist country to master the SLBM-related technology.Earlier in the day, the Washington Free Beacon reported that North Korea succeeded in the underwater test of a KN-11 missile near the eastern port of Sinpo on Dec. 21, citing unidentified U.S. defense officials.It followed a Nov. 28 test in which a KN-11 missile failed to leave the water. The failure damaged the North's first missile submarine, identified by officials as the Gorae, which means whale in Korean, the report said.The report provided no further details, not even if the missile's engine ignited after the ejection or whether the missile took flight.But it quoted an unidentified official as saying that based on the latest successful ejection test, North Korea could be as little as a year away from deploying a submarine armed with a nuclear-tipped missile. However, the South Korean military official played down the North's SLBM capability, arguing that Pyongyang would need more time before deploying SLBMs, although it is continuing relevant tests.The North remains silent about the reports of its SLBM test and the Pentagon refused to confirm it.Meanwhile, the North Korea-monitoring website, 38 North, also said that the reports of last month's SLBM test appear to be true and supported by new commercial satellite imagery of the Sinpo South Shipyard. Despite November's failed test, the North is continuing to actively pursue its SLBM development program, it said.Satellite imagery shows activity at the secure submarine area of the shipyard that is similar to the level of activity that has been previously seen prior to an SLBM test in May, 38 North said.In addition, 38 North said that the structure used to support a rocket engine, missile or launch tube, which is usually present either immediately prior to or shortly after a test is conducted, is in place. Also, the Sinpo-class submarine docked at the secure boat basin was seen with netting concealing ongoing work. \"North Korea's development of an SLBM and associated ballistic missile submarine has the potential to present a significant threat in the future. However, the development of an operational system will be an expensive, time-consuming endeavor with no guarantee of success,\" 38 North said.In May, North Korea claimed it successfully carried out an SLBM test underwater, renewing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The North's SLBM capability, if fully developed, would pose a serious threat because its mobile nature would make it very difficult to detect preparations for a launch.But experts said it was believed not to be a full-scale test, but an \"ejection\" test conducted in an early stage of developing SLBM capabilities. U.S. officials said the North also exaggerated progress and is many years away from developing an SLBM.Under U.N. resolutions, the North is banned from any ballistic missile activity.

(Yonhap)","925":"South Korea\u2019s labor minister renewed his calls for the passage of labor market reform bills Monday in his New Year\u2019s speech, amid growing resistance from the labor bloc and political wrangling over the pending bills at parliament. With the National Assembly\u2019s extra session expected to end Friday, Lee Ki-kwon, the minister of employment and labor, underscored the need for bills to revamp the nation\u2019s labor market to create jobs for the young and reduce job uncertainties. Members of the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions announce this year\u2019s plan to fight the government\u2019s push for labor market reforms near the statue of Jeon Tae-il, a deceased labor activist, along the Cheonggyecheon Stream in central Seoul, Monday. (Yonhap)\u201cLast year, we established a foundation for labor market reforms. This year, we need to bear the fruits,\u201d Lee said, referring to the \u201cgrand compromise\u201d made last September among management, labor and government representatives. \u201cSome labor unions are only focusing on improving their labor conditions, ignoring the spirit of trilateral compromise to create a fairer labor market structure,\u201d he said, calling the passage of market reform bills a \u201csafeguard\u201d for the workers on the edge of society. After months of debate over the labor market revamp, a tripartite committee of labor, business and government agreed on a series of reform measures, including clarifying employment guidelines and adopting the peak wage system on the condition of \u201csufficient\u201d consultation before pushing for such policies. While the government pushes ahead with the easing of labor regulations to boost the sluggish economy and add jobs for the young, the nation\u2019s labor unions have fiercely opposed the plan, viewing them as expanding temporary jobs and making it easier for employers to dismiss workers. Enraged by the government\u2019s announcement of a draft of guidelines on employment guidelines on Dec. 30, the Federation of Korea Trade Unions, one of the negotiators of the trilateral agreement, hinted at a plan to withdraw from the trilateral deal.\u201cExcluding the labor bloc, the government unilaterally revealed a draft of guidelines on easier dismissals and change of company rules,\u201d Kim Dong-man, head of the nation\u2019s largest umbrella union, said in a statement. The draft includes the government\u2019s administrative guidelines to ease restrictions for employers to fire underperforming workers and change company rules without unions\u2019 approval. The prospects for the passage of the key reform bills also remain bleak, as the rival parties have continued to lock horns over the embattled reform plan. As part of the Park Geun-hye administration\u2019s drive for labor market reform, the ruling Saenuri Party presented five bills related to labor conditions in September following the three-way agreement. The bills stipulate a reduction in working hours, improvements in benefits for the unemployed, extension of hiring contract workers, expansion of sectors that can employ temporary workers and adoption of the peak wage system.But the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea has refused to pass the bills through the National Assembly, mindful of the votes of the 1.4 million workers comprising the two largest umbrella labor unions. National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa expressed his hope to pass the embattled bills before the extraordinary session expires Friday. He remains reluctant to exercise his authority to put the bills to a vote without the rival parties\u2019 consent, citing the rule of law.Earlier in the day, the KCTU announced this year\u2019s plan to resist the government\u2019s push for labor market reforms in central Seoul, vowing to stage a strike Friday after the extra parliamentary session ends.

Under the deal with South Korea announced on Dec. 28, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologized to the Korean victims and Tokyo agreed to provide 1 billion yen (US$8.3 million) to a fund for the victims.\"We briefed the Chinese side on the comfort women deal at the request of the Chinese side,\" the South Korean diplomatic source said, using a euphemism for the victims who were forcibly mobilized at front-line Japanese military brothels during World War II.The deal paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to solve one of their thorniest issues. It was also in line with diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a united front with South Korea and Japan against China's increasingly assertive behaviors and North Korea's defiant pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons.While the deal was welcomed in Washington, China's state-run media cast a wary eye on the deal, calling it insincere.According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also China and other parts of Asia, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during the war.

The deal would allow companies to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming.No follow-up parliamentary measures have been taken.South Korea \"cannot get out of difficult times if we fail to make changes and reform,\" Park said in a new year meeting with officials, noting the country's future is at stake.Still, National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa renewed his opposition to invoking his authority to take a set of economic bills to the floor and put them to a vote.Under the National Assembly Act, a National Assembly speaker can table a bill to a plenary session for a vote in the event of a natural disaster, state emergency or under an agreement between rival parties.Chung said he told Park's chief of staff Lee Byung-kee at the meeting that economic bills and the issue of redrawing the electoral constituency map are two separate issues.Chung said he would table the issue of redrawing the electoral constituency map to the floor for a vote, without giving a specific time frame.The current electoral map became invalid by the end of last year.The rival parties are required to redraw electoral districts as the Constitutional Court ruled in October 2014 that the electoral map was unconstitutional, citing unequal representation.No opposition lawmakers attended the meeting at the presidential office.

Ahn Cheol-soo (Yonhap)But the party\u2019s key members lashed back at what they saw as Ahn\u2019s stubborn attitude, claiming that the party should do whatever it takes, including an inter-party merger, to deter the ruling conservative party\u2019s victory in the forthcoming April general elections.\u201cOne of our core tasks is to block the ruling party from taking a decision-making majority in the parliament,\u201d said election policy committee chairman Rep.

Stennis (CVN-74), a nuclear-powered submarine, aerial tanker aircraft and reportedly the B-2 stealth bomber during the annual springtime exercises. From the South Korean side, some 300,000 troops will take part. Military sources said the exercises will newly incorporate the allies' recently-signed operational plan, OPLAN 5015, which stipulates allied operations to launch precision attacks on North Korea's top leadership and its nuclear and missile arsenal in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula.The allies are also known to be integrating their new \"4D\" anti-North operational plan into the exercises, which details the allies' pre-emptive military operations to detect, disrupt, destroy and defend against North Korea's nuclear and missile arsenal. \"The focus of the exercises will be on hitting North Korea's key facilities precisely,\" one military official said.Key Resolve will run through mid-March, while Foal Eagle will continue until late April.Also on Monday the allies kicked off their biennial joint amphibious exercise, Ssangyong, involving more than 5,000 South Korean marine and Navy personnel along with 7,000 U.S. marine troops.Mobilizing more than three U.S. Navy ships, including the amphibious assault vessel USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), the drill will train forces on special operations and landing combat forces near critical North Korean targets, according to officials. North Korea is likely to respond to the massive joint exercises with retaliatory military action.During last year's exercises, North Korea fired short-range ballistic and surface-to-air missiles in protest of what they denounced as a prelude to an invasion of the North. \"We are keeping close watch for the North Korean military's further provocations that could come in the future,\" one military official said, asking not to be named. (Yonhap)","937":"Economic cooperation projects between North Korea and China were omitted from China's five-year economic plans, a document by Beijing's top economic planner showed Monday, an indication that may represent China's displeasure over Pyongyang's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. The document was presented by China's National Development and Reform Commission at the opening of the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, on Saturday. According to the document reviewed by Yonhap News Agency, there was no mention of North Korea in China's five-year economic projects with foreign countries. With regard to economic projects in China's northeastern provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, the document proposed business projects with Russia, South Korea, Japan, Germany and Israel, but it stopped short of mentioning North Korea. Last week, the United Nations adopted a raft of tougher sanctions against North Korea following the North's fourth nuclear test and rocket launch this year. The new U.N. sanctions came as a result of an agreement between the U.S. and China, North Korea's economic lifeline. The Chinese provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, which border North Korea, have also scaled back their economic cooperation projects with the North, according to their documents published in January.A diplomatic source in Beijing said the moves by the Chinese provinces were likely to be reflected by the Chinese central government's decision to join the new U.N. sanctions.Winning China's cooperation is key to ensuring the effectiveness of U.N. sanctions against North Korea because China accounts for nearly 90 percent of the North's foreign trade.Still, China is unlikely to vigorously implement sanctions on North Korea because a sudden collapse of the regime could spark a refugee crisis at its border and lead to a pro-U.S., democratic Korea on its doorstep, analysts say.

Seoul and Washington have said such exercises are purely defensive in nature.The North's bellicose rhetoric is routine at the time of the Seoul-Washington drills, but the North has ratcheted up the tone of its threats amid the international community's move to slap it with sanctions over its nuclear and missile tests.The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a fresh resolution to punish North Korea for its provocations.It calls for mandatory inspections of all cargo going into and out of North Korea and a ban on exports of mineral resources, a major source of hard currency for the cash-strapped country.North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6, followed by a long-range rocket launch last month, a move which outside experts view as a cover for a ballistic missile technology test.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered his military on Thursday to make nuclear weapons ready for preemptive attacks at any moment.Kim made such remarks when he inspected the test-firing of what the North says was a new multiple rocket launch system. Seoul said the North fired off six short-range projectiles into the East Sea in an apparent expression of anger over the U.N. sanctions.Experts said the North's military rhetoric appears to target its domestic audience to elicit allegiance in the face of the tougher sanctions and ahead of a major party event.North Korea plans to hold the first congress of its ruling party in more than three decades in May, pushing its people into working hard in its \"70-day campaign of loyalty.\" (Yonhap)","940":"The Bulgarian embassy last week marked the country\u2019s Liberation Day amid deepening ties with Korea that reached a \u201ccomprehensive and future-oriented partnership\u201d last year.

According to the Press Association of the U.K., more than 1,300 disclosures of criminal records had been made across England under the law, as of last year.In South Korea, statistics released by a number of think tanks and private agencies have been suggesting that dating abuse is a serious problem in the country. According to 2014 research by Duo, a leading matchmaking agency, 72.3 percent of the 491 surveyed single male and female Koreans in their 20s and 30s said they had been abused by a romantic partner. Further research by Lee Hwa-young at Korea Women\u2019s Hot Line -- a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence -- showed that up to 50 percent of Korean women said they had been physically abused by a romantic partner. Almost 90 percent of the participants said they had been either physically or emotionally abused within the context of dating or courtship. According to the police, the largest number of the reported cases last month, 61.9 percent, were cases of physical abuse, while 17.4 percent involved confinement and blackmailing. Meanwhile, sexual violence including rape accounted for 5.4 percent of all reported cases in February. By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","946":"South Korea will announce its own North Korea sanctions this week after the United Nations Security Council voted to impose stronger sanctions on the belligerent nation, a South Korean official said Sunday.The sanctions will likely include banning the entry of ships to South Korean ports from third-party countries that have been to North Korea and blacklisting more organizations and personnel related to the North's weapons of mass destruction, the official said on the condition of anonymity.The measures will be made public by the Prime Minister's Office of the South early this week, the official added.The UNSC unanimously adopted Resolution 2270 on Thursday, tightening the screws on the communist nation that sparked global outrage with its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and its long-range missile launch on Feb. 7 in violation of U.N. rules.South Korea has used practically all its cards that could pressure the North toward abandoning its nuclear program, the most notable of which is the shutdown of the inter-Korean industrial complex in Kaesong last month. Still, expanding sanctions on the North could lead more countries to cut trade with the communist nation, the official said.\"The most important effect we're expecting is publicizing that these organizations and personnel are problematic to the world,\" the official said. \"The North will of course be banned from trading with us. That will limit its trade internationally.\"Prohibiting third-party ships from entering South Korea via the North follows the same measure imposed by Japan on Feb. 10.The addition will likely nullify the Najin-Hassan Project, which has allowed Russian cargo to be transported to the South via the North Korean port of Najin.In addition to U.N. sanctions, South Korea has imposed its own financial sanctions on four Taiwanese and Syrian organizations and three individuals as being related to the North's nuclear activities. The new set of measures will likely add more.Among the likely subjects is Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who is known to be in charge of the North's foreign-exchange reserves. South Korea has recently claimed that 70 percent of the income earned by North Korea through the Kaesong Industrial Complex has ended up in the hands of the North's ruling Workers' Party of North Korea.Other potential subjects include the North's National Defense Commission and Kim's right-hand man, Hwang Pyong-so.

The UFG is another combined military exercise conducted by South Korea and the U.S.Meanwhile, this year's Ssangyong exercise will also be the largest-ever, involving more than 5,000 South Korean marine and Navy personnel, 7,000 U.S. marine troops and five maritime prepositioning ships. It runs from Monday to March 18.During the exercise period, the allies will strengthen their monitoring of the North for any signs of pre-emptive attack.\"We will carry out these exercises while keeping tabs on signs of North Korean provocations,\" a South Korean official said. \"If the North provokes us during this exercise, the U.S. and our troops will retaliate with an attack ten-fold stronger.\"The warning was made after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered his military on standby for pre-emptive nuclear strikes earlier this week.

The sides are co-headed by the South Korean ministry's Director General Maj. Gen. Jang Kyung-soo and U.S. Forces Korea's Maj. Gen. Robert Hedelund.After years of speculation over the local deployment of the U.S.-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, the allies announced last month that they will start discussing the U.S.-proposed deployment of the defense system in South Korea to better counter North Korea's growing missile threats.Friday's official talks were launched after the two sides signed terms of reference in forming the joint working group earlier in the day.The working level body will discuss an array of issues, including the military effectiveness of THAAD, appropriate sites for the deployment, timeline, cost-sharing, and the impact on safety and the environment, the ministry said.\"North Korea has continued its nuclear tests and long-range missile provocations and defied South Korea and the international community's deterrence efforts,\" the ministry said on the background of the deployment talks.\"The THAAD system to be operated by USFK will contribute to the defense of South Korea from North Korea's increasing nuclear and missile threats,\" it also said. North Korea demonstrated its growing nuclear and missile capabilities with its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6, which the communist country said was of a hydrogen bomb.On Feb. 7, it launched a long-range rocket to put a satellite into orbit, but the outside world regarded it as a cover for testing its intercontinental ballistic missile technology.The allies unveiled the deployment plan hours after the latest North Korean long-range rocket launch last month.The military has said the allies are seeking to deploy one THAAD battery \"at the earliest time possible,\" which is made up of a fire control unit, high-tech radar, six mobile launchers and 48 interceptor missiles. Inside South Korea, the deployment is highly controversial.Tentative candidate cities for hosting the defense system voiced opposition to deploying it to their neighborhoods, citing safety concerns involving electromagnetic wave emissions from the radar. China has shown explicit irritation over the missile interceptor to be operated by U.S. forces in South Korea, which they say could spy on China's military posture.The allies had postponed the joint working group's launch, which was initially set for Feb. 23.

A peace treaty replacing the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War has long been a key demand from Pyongyang.The U.S. and South Korea have already rejected the proposal, saying denuclearization must be the priority.On Thursday, however, Kirby appeared to be putting more of the focus on leaving open the possibility of a parallel process than on denuclearization, even though he stressed that nothing has changed in the U.S. position on the issue.\"I don't think we're in a position to rule out possible discussions on a peace process. But we're not going to decouple that in any way from what really needs to happen, which is complete denuclearization and adherence to the six party process,\" Kirby said.When the North proposed peace treaty talks last year, Kirby said that the U.S. \"made it clear that we weren't even going to begin to have that discussion until denuclearization was factored in.\"\"But nothing has changed on our policy that denuclearization has to be a part of this. And the six party talks is the process and the vehicle to do that,\" he said. (Yonhap)","951":"Park Myeong-eun (not her real name), an office worker in her 30s in Seoul, was devastated when her father abruptly collapsed and lost his consciousness back in 2012. She and her family took him to the nearest general hospital, where he was admitted to its emergency facility, which was packed with patients. Her father soon awoke, but he had to wait more than five hours to get an x-ray done. \u201cIt was really frustrating,\u201d she told The Korea Herald. \u201cWe were just repeatedly told that we needed to wait. No one explained to us anything.\u201dMore than three years have passed since Song\u2019s experience, but the latest report released by the Health Ministry showed that not much has changed.\u00a0 123RFThe report, written after inspecting a total of 414 general hospitals -- government-certified institutions with more than 500 patient beds -- last year, showed that at 27 hospitals a patient may need to wait at least 10 hours at emergency units to receive further treatment. The long waiting times and crowd at the nation\u2019s emergency centers were pointed out as one of the biggest contributing factors to last year\u2019s Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. About 50 percent of all confirmed MERS patients contracted the virus at Samsung Medical Center\u2019s emergency unit. \u201cIt has always been a problem,\u201d said Jeong Jae-su from the Korea Health and Medical Workers\u2019 Union. \u201cThe biggest problem is that while general hospitals are supposed to focus on treating inpatients with serious conditions, they also rely on outpatients for their profit. They are not sending back the kind of patients who don\u2019t need treatment at general hospitals. And this is why the emergency units are always crowded.\u201dGeneral hospitals not collaborating enough with smaller clinics is also cited as one of the causes, despite bigger facilities being advised to send patients with mild conditions to seek professional help from local and smaller services.\u201cWhen a patient is new to the hospital -- which many of the emergency patients tend to be -- most of the time they are asked to receive examinations for the diagnosis. So the more new patients a hospital receives, the more medical examinations they can perform. And more money comes out of that,\u201d Jeong said.Among the inspected hospitals, VHS Medical Center, a hospital for veterans and their families, had the longest waiting times for patients in critical conditions at its emergency unit -- an average of 23 hours. Busan Paik Hospital had the second longest waiting time, an average of 21.2 hours. Meanwhile, a patient would have to wait an average of 20 hours in order to receive further care after receiving urgent treatment at its emergency unit, the government report showed.\u201cGeneral hospitals are supposed to keep a certain amount of their beds empty for emergency patients who need to be hospitalized right away,\u201d said Seo Min-soo from the ministry\u2019s emergency healthcare division. \u201cBut a lot of the times the beds are occupied by outpatients.\u201dSeo stressed that while only 6.6 percent of the patients who were admitted to the most crowded 20 emergency medical centers last year spent more than 24 hours at the facilities, they occupied 43.4 percent of all patient beds available. The Health Ministry plans to retract government certification from general hospitals if the institutions house too many patients for more than 24 hours at emergency units, instead of giving them the necessary medical treatment or procedure as soon as possible, he said. A nurse who works at one of the most crowded hospitals anonymously said there are also many cases in which emergency patients are released without receiving sufficient care as inpatients. Once, a patient who just underwent a surgical procedure was given a meal even before passing gas, so she can be released as soon as possible, the nurse said. \u201cThis was done in order to have as many new patients as possible,\u201d she said \u201cAnd a number of such inpatients returned to the emergency unit as they weren\u2019t treated properly post-surgery.\u201d\u00a0 By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","952":"The chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee called for aggressive enforcement of new U.N.

Seoul Metropolitan Government said Wednesday it will expand its stray cat neutering project such as by providing subsidies of up to 75 million won ($61,000) per civic organization which carries out the \u201cTrap-Neuter-Return\u201d project. The TNR is a project that captures and sterilizes free-roaming cats to control their numbers. The TNR costs about 130,000 won per surgery, which has added burden to the budgets of civic groups.  (Yonhap)As of this year, about 250,000 cats are estimated to live on the street, with only about 11 percent neutered.Stray cats can be easily exposed to various viruses or diseases such as herpes virus or feline panleukopenia. As public complaints escalated over stray cats, the city has taken various measures to reduce their numbers. Starting from November last year, the city has run dozens of cat feeding spots in four regions to attract and capture animals for the TNR. It is considering expanding feeding places across the city.As of January, about 50 percent of stray cats in the feeding spots have been neutered. The city is seeking to raise the neutering rate by 70 percent by June, the authorities said. With 750 million won of budget, the city aims to neuter about 8,000 stray cat this year with the help of civic participation. The city neuters about 6,000 stray cats per year, officials said.The city also vowed to quarterly hold TNR Days on which veterinarians conduct on-site TNR for 50 cats in a day. To better attract the stray cats, the city will work with those who regularly feed the animals and are familiar with them. \u201cTo seek the harmonious coexistence of people and animals, the number of stray cats must be cut, and neutering is the most effective measure to do so,\u201d said Kim Chang-bo who is in charge of the public health affairs at Seoul City. Animal rights activists, however, have expressed skepticism over the project\u2019s effectiveness, citing the characteristics of cats. \u201cSince cats are colony animals, the surgery is not effective unless 70 percent of each colony cats are captured and neutered at one go,\u201d said Park So-yeon, the president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth, told The Korea Herald. \u201cAfter neutering, it is also important to return the neutered cats to their original colonies and not to random ones. If not, the un-neutered cats are likely attack the neutered cats, which have elevated aggression levels, causing them to run away from colonies. This will only lead to inflow of new stray cats.\u201dMeanwhile, organizations interested in the city\u2019s neutering subsidies should submit applications from March 17-18 at http:\/\/ssd.wooribank.com\/seoul.

Ahn Cheol-soo, who left the Minjoo camp late last year amid conflict with then-leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.\u201cThat (Moon Jae-in) leadership, which many quoted as a key reason of their defection, is no longer in power, which should now make it easier (for defectors) to come back,\u201d Kim said.The party chief also alluded that his idea of unity involved a formal unification of the two parties and not just inter-party solidarity, implying that the People\u2019s Party should integrate back into the Minjoo Party.\u00a0Kim Jong-in, interim chief of The Minjoo Party of Korea, attends the party\u2019s leadership meeting Wednesday. YonhapKim\u2019s eyebrow-raising proposal for unity is taken as an attempt to overcome the multiple challenges currently faced by the party, including supporters\u2019 spreading disappointment over the sudden suspension of the filibuster.\u201cWe have made every effort to share the details of the antiterrorism bill and to revise the inappropriate clauses,\u201d Kim said. Kim had reportedly been the most eager to persuade party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul on Monday to consider halting the filibuster to prevent any backlash, such as from deterring the passage of the revised public election bill to confirm the reallocation of the nation\u2019s constituencies.\u201cBut in consideration of various political agendas, most of all the nearing April 13 elections, we have decided to adjourn the filibuster and move on to urgent pending issues,\u201d he added.The filibuster was deemed the opposition\u2019s last resort to block the ruling conservative Saenuri Party\u2019s enforcement of the disputed bill, so the termination will eventually lead to the bill\u2019s passage, Kim admitted.\u201cBut we will by all means win a parliamentary majority in the elections and then revise the law,\u201d he suggested.The rival parties had agreed earlier last week to put the constituency bill to a floor vote, but follow-up legislative procedures were held off once the opposition kicked off the unlimited parliamentary relay talk on Feb. 23.The leadership\u2019s decision to voluntarily end the filibuster was welcomed by the rival Saenuri, which also took time to slam Kim\u2019s proposal for a reunion with defectors.\u201cI do not understand why (the Minjoo Party and People\u2019s Party) would reunite at this point in time, after all the fuss they made about their differences in policies,\u201d the Saenuri Party\u2019s floor leader Rep.

Notably, the number of male sex abuse victims aged 19 or above, who visited the centers for support, increased significantly in the last two years, from 72 in 2014 to 120 last year.Also, a total of 464 men also sought help for domestic abuse at the centers. The proportion of male domestic abuse survivors who visited the centers also increased by 1.4 percent points from the year before, from 6.9 percent to 8.3 percent. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of this as more men are being abused nowadays than in the past,\u201d said Hong Mi-ga from the Gender Ministry. \u201cWe think male survivors have always existed. We think more survivors are realizing there is help available and that it\u2019s okay to seek support.\u201dMeanwhile, the number of male children sex abuse victims \u2013 those aged 13 or under \u2013 dropped last year from the year before, from 545 to 433.In total, 1,019 male survivors were treated at the centers nationwide in 2015. Still, they only accounted for 5 percent of all 20,218 sex abuse survivors who sought help at the centers. The Gender Ministry last year released a report on sex abuses cases against men for the first time. The report contained research by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, which surveyed South Korean men who were sexually abused while serving their military duty, their perpetrators, as well as their witnesses. Majority or 74.7 percent of the surveyed survivors said they were abused for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, 72.9 percent of the perpetrators, as well as 76.8 percent of the witnesses, claimed the victims became subject to violence because they \u201clooked or behaved in a feminine manner.\u201dIn 2014, a male army conscript surnamed Yoon died after six male colleagues allegedly hit him in the chest while he was eating which led him to choke on his food. According to the Military Human Rights center, Yoon had been constantly sexually assaulted by the bullies, on top of being physically and verbally abused on a daily basis. Some 470 military same-sex sexual abuse cases were reported in 2013, but only 39.5 percent ended with convictions, according to the organization. While such military same-sex sexual violence prevails, the Gender Ministry currently has no statistics on the gender ratio of Korean perpetrators who have sexually abused men. According to data from the National Police Agency, a total of 25,223 Koreans were arrested for sex abuse charges. Among them, only 1.7 percent were women.South Korean law currently does not acknowledge same-sex rape or any forms of sexual penetration other than vaginal as rape. Accordingly, same-sex rape is defined as \u201crape-like\u201d by Korean law and carries lighter penalties. According to Gender Ministry\u2019s report last year on male sex abuse victims, 41.6 percent of the survivors said they took no action after being abused. Among them, 42.8 percent said they did not do anything as they did not acknowledge the assault as a form of violence.Among survivors, 60 percent of them experienced sexual harassment, such as being touched inappropriately or being kissed or held in ways that caused discomfort, while 20 percent of them were raped by the abusers. The report also revealed that male survivors who had been abused by same-sex perpetrators often developed self-loathing and anxiety disorders. One of the survivors interviewed by the government researchers said he volunteered to join the Marine Corps after being sexually assaulted, to prove to himself that he is not \u201cweak.\u201d \u201cI heard that the training at the Marine Corps is the toughest in the country,\u201d he told researchers.

Lee was the first to propose and push the filibuster as a way to block the majority ruling party from endorsing the controversial bills designed to give stronger surveillance power to the National Intelligence Service and fortify preventive measures against terrorist attacks.Lee consequently planned a press conference at 9 a.m. on Tuesday to declare the end of the filibuster, though it was delayed at the last minute.The party planned a general assembly later in the evening to further discuss their options.\u201cWe delayed the (formal announcement of ending the filibuster) in order to hear from the members who oppose the decision ... the decision to suspend it will not be overturned,\u201d said chief deputy floor leader Rep. Lee Choon-suak.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, welcomed the decision, perceived as a triumph for the party in the drawn-out tug-of-war over the controversial counterterrorism bills.\u201cWhile it is extremely regretful when we think about the hours wasted at the National Assembly through the filibuster, it is a relief that the Minjoo Party came to such decision,\u201d said Saenuri\u2019s chief spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul reiterated that no changes will be made to the counterterrorism bills that the opposition claims will seriously damage civil rights.\u201cAfter the opposition\u2019s filibuster is suspended, we will be voting on the antiterrorism bills tomorrow. ... There will be no further revision to the bills as we have reflected the demands from them over the past three months.\u201d\u00a0By Yeo Jun-suk\u00a0\u00a0(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","959":"South Korea will elect new National Assembly members in a general election on April 13. The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the fourth installment. -- EdWhen former Samsung Electronics executive Yang Hyang-ja announced in January that she would enter politics as a candidate for the main opposition party, the high-school graduate tried not to hype up her past achievements in breaking the glass ceiling.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say to those who want to succeed that working like me will bring them success,\u201d said the 49-year-old mother of two children. \u201cWe must build a society in which hard work is reciprocated by appropriate rewards and success,\u201d she said. . Yang, who became the first female executive in the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerate in 2012, is one of the potential candidates aiming to bring diversity to the stereotypical occupation profile of the established parties -- professional politicians with academic or legal backgrounds.\u201cIt is common to see that lawmakers coming from certain professions represent their interests. So it is fair to say that the more diverse the National Assembly becomes, the better it can represent diverse groups\u2019 interest,\u201d said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University The National Election Committee\u2019s data shows that out of 300 lawmakers elected in previous 2012 general election, some 70 percent were those that have been making a trade of politics, followed by 8 percent of those with academic background and about 6 percent of those with legal career. A similar trend is expected to unfold in the upcoming elections. The election watchdog statistics showed last week that among 1,460 potential candidates, some 36 percent were professional politicians, followed by 9 percent and 8 percent of those with legal and academic background, respectively.The mainstream parties\u2019 incumbents are also heavily lopsided toward members with legal expertise.Aside from professional politicians, former legal professionals are the most common occupations held by the members of the ruling Saenuri Party and the second most common jobs in the main opposition. The lawyers constituted 15 and 20 percent of the ruling and opposition party, respectively. \u201cOur party\u2019s chronic problem is that we have so many members with legal backgrounds,\u201d said Rep. Lee No-keun of the Saenuri Party. \u201cI am afraid that it would undermine the party\u2019s efforts to achieve diversity and keep up with changes,\u201d he said.Favored occupation has also varied slightly among the mainstream parties. While lawyers have been dubbed the most desirable professionals to join the conservative parties, liberal blocs have had their own favorite: civil activists who led the pro-democracy movements. The National Assembly saw a massive inflow of pro-democracy activists since 1992 when Korea held its general election after toppling the authoritarian government. The trend reached its peak in 2004 when the late President Roh Moo-hyun was in power. The number of activists who took the seats surged to 70, about seven times as many as those elected in previous elections.Yang Hyang-ja (Yonhap)One of the most common ways to improve diversity is the proportional representative system. In the 2012 elections, 52 were elected through proportional representation and their job profile ranged from poet to naturalized immigrant.But those with unique backgrounds have struggled to join mainstream politics, mainly because they are first-termers with little say in legislative affairs. The main parties\u2019 regulations mandate that proportional representation seats should only be given to those who have never been elected as a way of providing opportunity to fresh faces.Some of them, like Rep. Lee Jasmine of the Saenuri Party has constantly faced hurdles of racial and cultural discrimination in Korean politics and society which remains largely exclusive.Her legislative efforts, such as making laws to protect the education of illegal immigrants\u2019 children have been ostracized by conservatives as an \u201cattempt to help lawbreakers,\u201d with some not hesitating to use insulting slurs against the minority politician.The parties\u2019 dubious selection process of the proportional representatives have also shed light on the negative aspect of the decades-old system. In the 2008 election, a 30-year-old lawmaker elected through proportional representation lost her seat after being convicted of giving money to then fifth-term lawmaker Seo Chung-won. \u201cOne of the system\u2019s biggest problems is that it fails to bring diversity. When it comes to choosing the candidates, the parties consider political calculations and factional interest, not the expertise the potential lawmakers could bring,\u201d said Hyun Taek-soo, sociology professor at Korea University.Aware of the challenges, the political parties have been moving to compensate the shortfall with separate recruiting efforts to expand their political spectrum. The Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party of Korea have lately competed to announce new faces with unique backgrounds. The Minjoo Party, for instance, recruited political aspirants whose job profile does not traditionally fit with the liberal party. Aside from former Samsung executive Yang, they brought in video company Webzen chairman Kim Byung-kwan and Hanwha Investment & Securities CEO Chu Jin-hyung. Its recruitment of current interim leader Kim Jong-in, a conservative economist and former campaign strategist for President Park Geun-hye, has also been perceived as the party\u2019s fresh attempt to highlight economy, although the decision was also criticized both in and outside of the party for running counter to its liberal identity.The Saenuri Party is also trying to recruit high-profile figures to join the race to spruce up its image, although their efforts so far have been mediocre in the face of escalating in-house power struggles over nomination. They include 9-dan professional Go player Cho Hun-hyun, climber Um Hong-gil, and former labor union chief of Ssangyong Motor Kim Kyu-han. All three have reportedly turned the offer down.\u201cI understand it won\u2019t be easy, but the parties should have a system to train high-profile figures and teach them about politics. Those who are good at their jobs are not necessarily good at politics,\u201d said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy.Lee Jasmine\u00a0(Yonhap)While acknowledging the outreach efforts, experts pointed out that lawyers would continue to be the most sought-after background for those who pursue political career due to their professional expertise and job flexibility. \u201cAbove all, the Assembly is the place where people make laws. The expertise from those with legal backgrounds can be put to a great use when they gather to propose, revise and enact the bills,\u201d the Minjoo Party\u2019s former lawmaker Choe Jae-chun wrote in an op-ed. Professor Kim Min-jeon noted that the widespread job transition from a legal professional to politician also reflects the reality of the Korean politics.\u201cIn South Korea, it is hard for politicians to return to their jobs if they lose elections. Since lawyers are relatively less worried about losing their livelihood, they are more likely to take the risk and enter politics than other professionals,\u201d said Kim.By Yeo Jun-suk(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","960":"Military law allowing heavier penalties for insulting the head of state is constitutional, Korea\u2019s top law court said Tuesday.In a 7-2 decision, the Constitutional Court decided that the tougher punishments for soldiers who affront the president is constitutional, as the president is the commander-in-chief, making him or her the highest position in the military command system.\u00a0 (Yonhap)An army sergeant, whose information was withheld, filed a constitutional appeal after he was sentenced to a six-month jail term with one year probation for posting nine messages criticizing former President Lee Myung-bak on Twitter in 2011. Current military rules stipulate that soldiers insulting a superior can be punished by up to three years in jail. This is heavier than similar charges for civilians, which can be punished by up to one year in jail or a fine of 2 million won ($1,600).He had claimed that the concept of \u201csuperior\u201d was ambiguous and too broad, and that it excessively breaches the freedom of speech.The court, however, ruled that the president is his superior with the right to command.\u201cThe Constitution clearly stipulates that the president is the commander-in-chief, and the military commanding law also specifies that the president and soldiers are in a relationship of command and obedience,\u201d the verdict said. The court also recognized the necessity of a separate penalty rule for soldiers, noting: \u201cIn criminal cases, the punishment is impossible once the complaint is withdrawn. (If such cases happen in the military) this can lead to indiscipline risk for the military command system, thereby putting national safety at risk.\u201dThe two dissenting judges said the regulation breaches the freedom of speech, as the scope of \u201cinsulting\u201d in the rule is too comprehensive and, therefore, limits the chances to fairly settle community problems.

Security Council is set to vote on a new resolution early Wednesday morning, officials said Tuesday, raising the possibility of a unanimous adoption of strengthened sanctions against North Korea.The vote will be held at 5 a.m. Korean time and all 15 members of the council are expected to endorse the resolution, according to an official from the South Korean mission to the U.N.In this Oct. 10, 2015, photo, missiles are paraded in Pyongyang, North Korea during the 70th anniversary celebrations of its ruling party`s creation. (AP-Yonhap)The U.S. presented the draft measures to the council on Thursday last week after reaching an agreement with China. While initially anticipated to be adopted as early as Friday, the resolution hit a snag after Russia requested more time to review the text. As Russia is one of the five permanent council members with veto rights, winning its support has been crucial to imposing sanctions on North Korea.Moscow has stressed that the sanctions should not inflict damage upon legitimate ties by foreign partners or deteriorate the humanitarian situation in the North. North Korea sparked international furor with its Jan. 6 nuclear weapons test and Feb. 7 rocket launch, which violated previous resolutions barring it from nuclear and ballistic missile development.President Park Geun-hye, calling the U.N. resolution \u201cpowerful and effective,\u201d vowed Tuesday that international pressure on North Korea would continue until the North undergoes changes. She has continued taking a hard-line approach toward Pyongyang, even mentioning the collapse of the Kim Jong-un regime during a Feb. 16 speech. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said that the new sanctions will be the \u201cstrongest imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades.\u201dAccording to a draft resolution, the new sanctions include binding comprehensive arms embargo as well as inspections on all shipments passing through member state\u2019s waters to or from North Korea to search for illicit cargo.Transfers of any items to North Korea that could contribute to the capabilities of the country\u2019s armed forces will be banned, and assets of any of its state or ruling party-related organizations that are involved in banned activities can be frozen.The new measures will block all mineral exports from the North, except for \u201clivelihood purposes\u201d and will suggest sanctions on all supplies of jet and rocket fuel.While the gist of the draft resolution is expected to be the same, one diplomat was quoted as saying that there had been \u201cminor changes to the text,\u201d although he did not elaborate.But some experts have pointed out that the sanctions have limits in pressuring the North, given that it does not have effective limitations on cross-border trade with China. In addition, they do not require China -- Pyongyang\u2018s biggest trading partner -- to cut off oil exports or limit North Korean workers working in countries like China, Russia from sending home their earnings.Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University, said while the sanctions may inflict damage upon North Korea, it may not be enough to make it abandon its nuclear ambitions.\u00a0By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","962":"The main opposition leadership\u2019s decision to suspend the record-breaking filibuster Tuesday sparked intense pushback from the party\u2019s hard-liners, displaying intraparty tensions amid persisting legislative deadlock.\u00a0\u00a0 An independent lawmaker filibusters at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Filibusterers, many of them within the hawkish wing of The Minjoo Party of Korea, urged the party\u2019s whip Rep.

This is the third installment. -- Ed.A police officer teaches children how to report child abuse cases at a school in Gwangju on Feb. 23. (Yonhap)Child abuse counselor Lee Tae-ho remembers when he and other police officers were dispatched to an apartment in Seoul in October 2014 after a neighbor reported the sounds of a child being beaten on the floor below.They found a mother in her 40s hitting her 10-year-old daughter with a rice paddle for not getting a perfect score on a school exam. When Lee tried to intervene, the mother resisted, claiming it was her way of disciplining her child.Corporal punishment, or \u201crod of love,\u201d remains the most common justification behind what escalates into child abuse, according to the counselor.\u201cThe mother, after several rounds of counseling, said she used to think of her daughter as her possession, not as an individual person. Her unrealistic expectations for her child led to child abuse in this case,\u201d said Lee, who works for the National Child Protection Agency.A total of 10,027 cases of child abuse were reported in 2014, according to the latest statistics available at the Health and Welfare Ministry. From 2004 to 2013, a total of 95,622 child abuse cases were reported to child protect agencies, the Korean Institute of Criminology\u2019s report shows, with more than 55,000 cases confirmed. This indicated that an average of 15.2 child maltreatment cases happened daily.Of abuse cases reported from 2004-2013, 83 percent were perpetrated by the parents. Such cases rose sharply, by 72 percent overall from 3,167 in 2004 to 5,454 in 2013. Separate data from the government also showed that a total of 148 children died of abuse from 2001 to the first half of last year. Discipline or child abuse?A 47-year-old pastor (left) and stepmother (center) are taken into custody for beating their 13-year-old daughter to death and hiding the body for 11 months in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 4. The deceased girl\u2019s aunt (right) is also charged with abusing the child. (Yonhap)Physical punishment is considered a traditional method of discipline in South Korea.While most municipalities have banned corporal punishment in schools since 2008, physical punishment at home is still debated here -- whether parents have the right or whether the form of discipline is even effective or constructive.\u201cTraditional Confucian culture has emphasized the parents\u2019 duty to teach and discipline their children for a better future, whereas the children\u2019s rights as individuals have not been respected,\u201d said Lee Bae-keun, president of the Korea Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.\u201cSuch social consensus over parents\u2019 rights and duty to discipline their children has silently allowed them to physically punish the children with the so-called \u2018rod of love,\u2019\u201d said Lee.Experts pointed out that despite the prevalent discipline culture, there is a clear difference between discipline and abuse.\u201cAlthough the line may be ambiguous, child abuse is usually repetitive and persistent, unlike discipline. The intensity of the punishment is also much stronger. Children who get punished sense for themselves first whether they are being abused or disciplined,\u201d said social welfare professor Kim Jun-hwan of Chung Cheong University.Lee of KAPCAN noted, \u201cThe discipline is only successful when empathy is shared first. Children must be persuaded as to why they are being punished.\u201dThis year, a series of extreme child abuse cases leading to the death of the children at the hands of their parents reignited the debate as to whether Korean society\u2019s relatively lenient attitude toward physical discipline runs counter to the protection of the young from violence.Last month, a 42-year-old mother surnamed Park in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province, was arrested for allegedly beating her 7-year-old daughter to death and leaving the child tied to a chair overnight. The mother claimed she had attempted to discipline the child for damaging the furniture. Police decided to charge the mother for violating the child protection law, killing the victim and abandoning the body. Prosecutors are currently looking into adding a murder charge.\u201cMany parents do not realize that small physical punishment is the start of child abuse. Once the abuse continues over three years, it is difficult to stop it,\u201d said NCPA counselor Lee. Physical punishment at home has been banned in 48 countries, starting with Sweden in 1979, Finland in 1983 and Norway in 1987.As part of efforts to better protect children\u2019s rights, the Korean government revised the Child Welfare Act in February last year and banned any kind of \u201cphysical, verbal or mental abuse against children.\u201d \u201cAlthough the regulation now legally prohibits physical punishment, civil law still leaves room for potential physical child abuse. There\u2019s a social consensus that physical punishment is justifiable for \u2018child discipline,\u2019\u201d said lawyer Sin Su-kyung of the NCPA. Article 915 of Korean civil law, which stipulates parental authority, allows for a person with parental authority to protect and educate children, or \u201ctake necessary disciplinary action\u201d against children. Public obsession with parental rights\u00a0Police officers recover the body of a 7-year-old who was beaten to death by her 42-year-old mother and buried in a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 15. (Yonhap)It is only recently that the South Korean government has started acknowledging cases where children must be protected from their parents.In September 2014, the government allowed prosecutors to restrict or take away parental rights of parents if they habitually abuse their children or cause serious injury. It also strengthened the penalty for child abuse to a minimum five years of prison and up to life imprisonment if the abuse leads to death. Once child maltreatment is confirmed on the spot, police officers and child protection officials are allowed to separate children from their parents and temporarily restrict the parental rights. Public child protection agencies automatically become guardians for the children. The parental rights restriction, however, has seen very limited use due mainly to the cultural obsession with parental rights, experts pointed out. \u201cMany Korean parents misunderstand \u2018parental rights\u2019 as their right to \u2018possess\u2019 their children. But it actually exists to mandate the parents to \u2018protect\u2019 their children. If parents fail to protect their children, it is reasonable to restrict the rights until they are ready to protect them. But many consider restricting parental rights as cutting the blood relationship,\u201d Sin said. \u201cAs parental rights have been a symbol of the blood relationship, authorities have been cautious of strictly taking restriction measures.\u201d According to the Supreme Court\u2019s data in 2014, parental rights restrictions or separation measures were only imposed on 37 child abuse cases in the first year the measure was introduced. This accounted for 0.9 percent of the total child abuse cases of the year.\u201cKoreans must abandon the \u2018fantasy\u2019 about parental rights. Parental rights restriction does not mean the end of their ties. Temporary restriction just means that public agencies will have the representative authority to protect the children,\u201d Sin said.Limited anti-child abuse measures Amid growing awareness over child abuse upon a series of heinous crimes committed by parents against their children, the government has been toughening anti-child abuse measures.The police vowed last month to expand the number of child abuse investigators, while the Seoul Central District Court installed a new justice department dedicated to child abuse cases. To better uncover hidden child abuse cases, the Education Ministry mandated schools report whenever a student is absent for more than three days consecutively.To broaden the search for victims of child abuse in blind spots, the ministry also vowed to cooperate with district offices to find children who had never been registered for school.The Welfare Ministry announced Thursday it would conduct on-site monitoring of infants who do not have medical checkup records in order to look into cases of parents neglecting their health care duty. While the government has stepped up efforts to better expose and curb child abuse cases with tougher punishments, other steps must be carried out in conjunction in order to effectively root out child abuse, experts said. \u201cMost of the state\u2019s child abuse programs are victim-oriented, such as psychological counseling. As important as the treatment programs are for the victims, those for child abusers are crucial, as many offenders were once victims,\u201d professor Kim said. According to the Welfare Ministry, 536 of 10,000 child abuse offenders in 2014 were previously victims of child abuse. About 33 percent of the offenders responded that they did not know correct parenting skills.\u201cOther than physical punishment, most offenders are ignorant as to how to discipline their children. In terms of the whole society, there\u2019s a need to have an education infrastructure to train proper parenting skills for all parents,\u201d Sin added.

However excluding those not receiving private lessons, the actual amount spent per student rose to 355,000 won.The survey was based on interviews with 43,000 parents of elementary, middle and high school students enrolled across 1,244 schools nationwide. The budget for private education was mostly proportional to the age of the students, the data showed. The average for elementary school students inched up 0.1 percent on-year to 286,000 won, while that for middle and high school students rose 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent, to 397,000 won and 471,000 won respectively.Elementary school students were the most reliant on private education, with nearly 81 percent taking extracurricular lessons, followed by middle school students at 69.4 percent and high school students at 50.2 percent. Elementary and middle school students spent the most time on private tutoring. They spent 6.4 hours per week, while high school students spent 4.1 hours. Meanwhile, the nation\u2019s total amount of spending on private education saw a 2.2 percent decrease from the previous year at 17.8 billion won, on the back of a drop in the number of students. The number of students dwindled from 7.23 million to 6.08 million over the period 2010 to 2015.The data also showed a widening gap in spending on private education between high-income and low-income families. Households that earn less than 1 million won only invested 66,000 won in private education. In contrast, families that earn more than 7 million won a month spent 420,000 won on their children\u2019s private lessons. By subject, monthly spending on major subjects like Korean, English and mathematics saw a 0.3 percent decrease, or 1,000 won, to 190,000 won, compared to a year earlier. Spending on sports, arts and music in the private sector increased by 5.4 percent to 53,000 won. By region, Seoul spent the most (338,000 won), followed by Gyeonggi Province (265,000 won) and Daejeon (254,000 won). South Jeolla Province invested the least in private education per person (165,000 won) for the second consecutive year.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","971":"The U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea's human rights situation urged Russia Friday against implementing an extradition treaty with North Korea, saying it could lead to the forced repatriation of North Korean workers in Russia.Marzuki Darusman expressed alarm at the deal signed earlier this month, noting it calls for \"transferring and readmitting individuals 'who have illegally' left their country and stay 'illegally' in another's territory.\"About 10,000 North Koreans are estimated to be working in Russia, mostly in the far eastern region. Some of them stay there after their contracts end in order to seek asylum.\"Given the practice of the DPRK to send laborers to Russia who often work in slave-like conditions, it is feared that such a treaty could also be used to capture and repatriate workers who attempt to seek asylum,\" Darusman said in a statement released through the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\"I strongly urge Russia to respect the principle of non-refoulement and not to implement the treaty,\" he said.North Koreans forcibly repatriated to their homeland are often subjected to torture, arbitrary detention, summary execution, forced abortions and other sexual violence, the rapporteur added, citing a 2014 report by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry.\"I also note that the signing of the treaty took place against the context where the DPRK continues to commit deliberate belligerent acts, such as nuclear testing followed by the latest missile launch,\" he said. \"Such acts adversely impact on the constructive efforts to address the ongoing gross human rights violations in the country, and reinforce even further the international community's resolve to pursue political and legal accountability.\" (Yonhap)","972":"Police said Friday they have decided to prohibit their officials from using private email accounts on office computers as tension rises over North Korea's possible cyber attack.The move came about two weeks after the National Police Agency announced that North Korean hackers allegedly sent massive amounts of spam emails to South Korean public organizations last month.It was the latest in a series of hacking attacks on domestic public organizations in recent years, amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula following North Korea's fourth nuclear test. Police said they will block access to the accounts at every office computer in the country's police stations starting next month, except for some departments, including investigative teams. Other officers will use the official email addresses given to them.\"We followed written advice sent by the National Intelligence Service,\" an official said.North Korea has a track record of waging cyber attacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.

Nine lawmakers were excluded from the tally as they either lost their parliamentary seats or disbanded their supporters' clubs.The 2015 tally is 28.2 percent down from the previous year, when lawmakers raked in 50.4 billion won in total donations, or 168.6 million won on average for each lawmaker. An upper limit of 300 million won was set for political donations in 2014 because it was an election year.The splinter opposition Justice Party received the highest amount of political donations on average for each lawmaker of 158 million won, followed by the Minjoo Party and the ruling Saenuri Party with 126 million and 122 million won per lawmaker, respectively.By individual, Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the Justice Party earned the most with 173.4 million won, while Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, the head of the ruling party's nomination committee for the April general elections, earned the least with 12.6 million won.Political analysts attributed a fall in donations to continuing public dissatisfaction with the performances of sitting lawmakers whose four-year terms expire on May 29.South Koreans are set to go to the polls in April to elect new lawmakers. (Yonhap)","974":"A debate is heating up over whether South Korea should pursue nuclear armament after North Korea has fueled security jitters here by conducting a fourth nuclear test last month.Experts and politicians are sharply divided as they contemplate the potential benefits and perils of the South's nuclearization, which they say is bound to reshape the contours of regional politics and security. The Seoul government has said that its vision of a nuclear-free peninsula will remain unchanged with the U.S.' security backing, and that it would abide by its obligations under an international non-proliferation regime.Calls for a nuclear deterrent resurfaced after what Pyongyang claims to be a hydrogen bomb test on Jan. 6. A recent survey, commissioned by Yonhap News Agency and local broadcaster KBS, found more than 50 percent of South Koreans were in favor of their country's nuclear armament.Proponents have been calling for Seoul to either develop its own nuclear weapons or ask its ally, Washington, to redeploy tactical nuclear arms that were withdrawn from the peninsula shortly before an inter-Korean denuclearization accord took effect in 1992.\"We cannot borrow the (nuclear) umbrella whenever it rains. We, ourselves, should have a sturdy rain coat,\" Rep. Won Yoo-chul, the floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, said during his parliamentary speech earlier this month.His remarks followed the repeated argument by former ruling party leader Chung Mong-joon that Seoul should call for the redeployment of tactical U.S. nuclear arms here. \"Seoul can no longer deal with a neighboring rogue state armed with a machine gun when it has only a stone to hurl,\" he has said.Supporters for nuclearization argue that the South should secure reliable deterrence by creating a \"balance of terror\" with the North -- a condition under which one dares not initiate nuclear warfare that would lead to mutual annihilation. Others claim that a nuclear-power status would enable the South to bolster national pride, reduce its security reliance on the U.S., secure a more balanced relationship with the superpower ally and curtail heavy expenditures on its conventional military buildup.They also say nuclear weapons would serve as a bargaining chip to pressure the North to denuclearize when the communist regime does not regard the non-nuclear South as a legitimate negotiating partner.\"Time has come for Seoul to consider nuclear armament from the standpoint of self-defense rather than relying only on the U.S. nuclear umbrella or U.N. Security Council sanctions,\" Cheng Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the state think tank Sejong Institute, said in his contributing article to Shindonga, a local magazine.Arguments in favor of going nuclear reflect growing misgivings about U.S.' security commitment to the South, analyst said. As the financially-strained U.S. employed a \"retrenchment\" policy of reducing international engagement and expenditures, security concerns here have increased.\"Calls for nuclear arms here send a strong message to the U.S. that the South has doubts about the U.S.' security guarantee in the event of a contingency on the peninsula,\" said Yang Wuk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defense and Security Forum.\"From the U.S.' reluctance to promptly intervene in the cases of Crimea, Libya and Syria to its ongoing moves to transform the U.S. troops in Korea into an expeditionary force from a hitherto static force wholly responsible for deterring the North, all these have stoked the misgivings.\"Those against nuclearization warn of serious military, diplomatic and economic ramifications. They said the pursuit of nuclear weapons would trigger a regional nuclear arms race and deal a serious blow to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- only to infuriate the U.S. to the extent that it wants to terminate the alliance treaty with the South. \"The NPT has been a major vehicle for limiting nuclear proliferation. The withdrawal of a major U.S. ally from the NPT would be a major embarrassment for the United States, and cause many other countries to question whether they should also withdraw,\" Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the U.S.-based Rand Corp., said.\"Therefore, there would be considerable pressure both within the United States and internationally for the country to punish South Korea for this action, in part to discourage other countries from withdrawing from the NPT.\" Bennett added that the cancellation of the alliance would mean the withdrawal of U.S. troops and all of their military equipment from the peninsula, which would seriously compromise the South's defense capabilities.\"(The South's nuclearization) could well lead to the termination of the alliance -- the United States withdrawing its forces from South Korea and shedding the infrastructure that allows U.S. forces to flow to Korea if a conflict develops,\" he said. \"In short, if U.S. forces leave, they are unlikely to come back, even if South Korea is invaded by the North.\"Balbina Hwang, a political scientist at American University and former U.S. State Department official, said that a decision to go nuclear would make the South as much a \"pariah state\" as the North. She stressed the decision should be based on serious contemplation and rational considerations, \"not hysteria or emotion.\"\"The decision to become a nuclear weapons state would crucially jeopardize the entire future of the Republic of Korea, and endanger its current status as an acknowledged, respected, and even admired leading member of the global community,\" she said.The scholar highlighted the enormous economic ramifications of international sanctions for nuclearization, saying the export-driven South Korean economy would collapse \"immediately.\" Exports contribute about 70 percent of South Korea's annual economic growth. \"Can the ROK economy bear the economic costs of international sanctions and economic isolation? Absolutely not, as the South Korean economy is still highly dependent on its open ties to the international economy,\" she said.Some analysts repudiated the claim that the South's possession of nuclear arms would enable the nuclear \"balance of terror\" with the North. They said such a Cold War-era deterrence strategy would only work based on the premise that a potential adversary would think \"rationally\" and would not risk a nuclear exchange.\"The balance of terror is a very unstable condition in light of the fact that we can't expect the North to think rationally. North Korea is particularly dangerous given that its unpredictable leader Kim Jong-un calls all the shots,\" Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University, said.\"On top of this, a war could be precipitated due to miscalculations and misperceptions, which would make it difficult to expect peace from the balance of terror.\"Some point to practical concerns such as finding storage facilities for nuclear arsenal, which would likely be placed in the crosshairs of Pyongyang's nuclear forces.\"I have to ask: which South Korean community or communities will volunteer to become the storage locations for South Korean nuclear weapons?\" said Bennett of the Rand Corp. \"They would do so knowing that they would become nuclear target number one of at least the North Korean nuclear weapons.\" (Yonhap)","975":"The United States and China have agreed on a U.N. resolution on North Korea, the White House said Wednesday, with reports speculating that the new expanded sanctions would call for blacklisting three key state agencies overseeing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi agreed during a meeting \u201con the importance of a strong and united international response to North Korea\u2019s provocations, including through a U.N.

The U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on it in January last year for the hacking attacks, but the agency has not been sanctioned by the Security Council.The Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry and the National Aerospace Development Administration are in charge of the North\u2019s nuclear weapons development and its long-range ballistic missile program, respectively. A U.N. panel of experts has recommended adding them to the sanctions list.Negotiations on the draft resolution began six weeks ago after North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and claimed it was a thermonuclear device.A council diplomat described the draft resolution as a \u201csignificantly substantive text\u201d while another diplomat said it contained \u201ca large number of very tough measures,\u201d as well as names to be added to the sanctions black list.Among the toughest measures, the United States has been pushing for a ban on North Korean ships in all ports, but that was met with strong resistance from China.Beijing has been reluctant towards backbiting sanctions that take aim at North Korea\u2019s already weak economy, due to concerns that the isolated state could collapse, unleashing chaos on China\u2019s border.The council has imposed four sets of sanctions on North Korea since it first tested an atomic device in 2006.(From news reports)","976":"A significantly higher number of South Korean drugs were approved for phase 3 clinical trials last year, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced Thursday.Phase 3 clinical trials are the final testing of drugs on patients to assess efficacy and safety before they are distributed to the public.The ministry said that the largest number of newly approved drugs were anticancer medicine.\u00a0 Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (Yonhap)Clinical trials involving new drugs in Korea are commonly classified into four phases -- phases 0, 1, 2 and 3.

(Yonhap)","981":"Drinking up to two cups of coffee a day can significantly reduce the risk of osteoporosis, a bone disease that can lead to higher risk of fractures, a South Korean study showed Wednesday. Organized and published by the Seoul National University Hospital, the research only analyzed symptoms among menopausal women. It conducted research on 4,066 menopausal women who had been tested for bone density between 2008 and 2011. According to the study, those who drank less than a single cup of coffee daily had a 21 percent lower chance of developing osteoporosis compared to those who did not drink coffee at all. Notably, menopausal women who drank a single cup of coffee a day had a 33 percent lower chance of developing the condition. Those who drank two cups of the beverage had a 36 percent lower chance of developing the disease.Drinking too much coffee had previously been said to rob the body of necessary nutrients, such as calcium, needed to maintain bone health. But Dr. Park Sang-min, who organized the research, said drinking coffee can improve a woman\u2019s bone health as long as she does not drink it too much. \u201cIt is unlikely that a woman would develop osteoporosis by drinking coffee unless she drinks more than three glasses (600 ml) daily,\u201d he said.Menopause is known to increase a woman\u2019s risk of developing osteoporosis, as the drop in estrogen levels during and after menopause results in higher bone loss.

The rival parties have agreed that they will finalize the rule before the Assembly plenary session Tuesday, a day before overseas Koreans start their voter registration. \u201cIf we fail to reach an agreement before Tuesday, we may have to postpone the general elections slated for April 13,\u201d said Assembly Speaker Rep.

Under the administrative guidelines to be proposed by the Korea Communications Commission, Web users will be able to demand that Web portals remove personal information that they do not want online. \u201cWe have studied the rights to be forgotten for more than a year through a group composed of legal, academic and industry experts,\u201d an official from the media watchdog said. \u201cWe plan to introduce the guidelines in the first half of the year.\u201d  (123rf)The European Court of Justice already set a major precedent in 2014 when it ruled in favor of the right to be forgotten by upholding a complaint made by a Spanish man who asked Google to remove search results relating to the forced sale of his house. The court said that the erasure of the information was considered \u201cirrelevant\u201d given the time lapse. Under the new guidelines, ordinary people will be allowed to demand that search engines remove online information relating to themselves, even if the data was legally posted. Decisions on whether information should be removed from search engines will depend on factors such as the nature of the information. For instance, the information should not be about public figures, such as high-profile officials and lawmakers, neither should they be newspaper articles and academic research that are in public interest.Controversy can surface over the criteria and standards for the removal of such personal data. Hence government officials and experts have to juggle between an individual\u2019s privacy and the public\u2019s right to know. The media watchdog said it will map out the guidelines in a loose, self-regulated form, given ongoing controversy over censorship and the public\u2019s right to know. One sticking point is whether to give the right to ask for deletion only to those who write the posts in question. Also, it has yet to be decided whether the guidelines will only apply to large search engines or even include smaller Web platforms. The communications regulator is also mulling over whether to set up a separate body to determine what data can be removed. The current information communications network act stipulates that only illegal information is subject to deletion. This includes the nation\u2019s confidential data, harmful content, lewd videos and photos as well as data that tarnishes one\u2019s reputation and privacy. In 2007, the government introduced a rule called \u201ca temporary measure\u201d under the information act, which allowed online users to ask for the removal of search results that damage reputation.The rule compelled the nation\u2019s largest portal sites Naver and Daum to block access to the information in question for the first 30 days and then to permanently delete it later. In 2014, Naver and Daum received requests to delete 337,923 and 116,261 posts, respectively. Both agreed to remove nearly 95 percent of them, according to the media monitoring agency.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","997":"A Seoul district court said Sunday it will become the first court in the country to create a division solely dedicated to trying child abuse cases after a series of extreme cases of violence against children surfaced around the country.The Seoul Central District Court said three of its criminal justice panels will be changed to try only child abuse cases starting Monday. The three will be comprised of a single-justice panel, a group panel and an appeals panel.The move has been taken to reflect the growing societal concerns over violence against children, the court said.The number of child abuse cases in the country nearly doubled over the past 10 years, according to the Korea Institute of Criminology. In 2004, there were 6,998 cases of violence against children. In 2013, the number soared to 13,076 cases. Over the past decade, an average 15 cases of child abuse were reported every day.The Seoul court isn't technically the first South Korean court to create a panel dedicated to child abuse cases.

In Seoul, 720 cases were reported in 2012 and this increased to 815 in 2013, 954 in 2014 and 532 in just the first half of 2015.Most of the offenders are parents. According to the Welfare Ministry, 45.2 percent of all reported child abuse cases in 2014 were committed by biological fathers and 32.0 percent by biological mothers.Laws on punishing child abuse crimes have been revised over the past year to obligate teachers, public servants dealing with child care and welfare policies, medical staff and employees at child care facilities to report any suspicious case of child abuse. Failure to make a report will mean they can be fined up to 5 million won. However, so far no such penalties have been meted out yet.

Ock Hyun-ju\/The Korea Herald\u201cI know that some people think it is racist policy, we really do feel bad,\u201d the 20-something bouncer said.Another English teacher, 24, from New Zealand, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the \u201cweird\u201d sign would be illegal and offensive back home. \u201cKorea is vastly developed in technology and economic pursuits but still a little underdeveloped in cultural acceptance and knowledge of the outside world,\u201d he said.According to several foreign residents The Korea Herald contacted, Korean-only bars are not a general trend, but they exist across the nation, creating perpetual controversy over racism.AU, the biggest club in Daegu, a city near one of the U.S. Army bases, said it decided to restrict foreign patrons\u2019 entry after several cases of theft and sexual harassment by foreign patrons. \u201cOnce the club starts receiving foreign customers selectively, it could become really complicated,\u201d a manager at the club said. \u201cSo we deny entry for all foreigners to the club as a preventive measure.\u201dA manager of another club in Busan said that it enforced a ban because foreign customers did not respect club rules. \u201cWe refuse foreigners who do not respect the dress code. We also reject Koreans for the same reason. It is just that Koreans understand what we say and do not challenge the policy,\u201d the manager said. \u201cBut foreigners who cannot speak Korean fail to get the point, get mad and keep resisting the rule. They just do not listen.\u201d A 33-year-old American, who lived in Korea for eight years, said that the longer foreigners live here, the more they can understand it is not usually Koreans trying to discriminate.\u201cBars and clubs are a social business. They have a certain motivation to go after an atmosphere they want for their business,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when there\u2019s something you want, but you cannot get it, it is much easier to say \u2018racism\u2019 than to understand why.\u201d (Online Community)But a 30-year-old woman from the U.S., who was turned down at one of the dating bars around Konkuk University last December, berated the bars for generalizing. \u201cOn any given night of the week, I see Koreans behaving pretty badly as well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the entire race of Koreans should suffer the consequences.\u201d Korea, a largely homogenous country until the recent rise in number of multicultural families, still lags in catching up to international standards in terms of racism and diversity. There is still no law mandating equal opportunity or preventing people from being discriminated against based on race, religion or sexuality.The bars and clubs excluding foreign patrons cite freedom of private businesses to decide which customers they serve at their venues.\u201cI know that a few clubs in Hongdae refuse to accept foreigners, especially American soldiers, based on their past experiences. They have suffered from the U.S. soldiers getting into brawls and creating a ruckus,\u201d said Kim Jung-hyun, head of the Hongdae Tourism and Culture Association. \u201cBut it is not a matter of racism. It is up to business owners to determine who to let in.\u201d (Online Community)According to police data, the number of crimes committed by the U.S. soldiers in Hongdae stood at 19 in the first half of last year. In comparison, some 150 crimes were committed by Koreans against foreign visitors in Busan in a 10-day-period earlier this month, according to the district police. They included theft, fraud and assault.Ordinary Koreans were split over the decision by bars and clubs to keep foreigners out, with some calling it an embarrassment while others blamed it on cultural differences. \u201cAs someone who has seen foreign men getting into fights on the streets, I understand why some bars ban them from entering,\u201d said a Lee Jin-hee, a 22-year-old student, looking for a bar in the clubbing area of Hongdae. \u201cIf they spoke Korean, or at least tried to learn Korean culture and manners, they would not be denied.\u201dBut many Koreans like a 29-year-old office worker, surnamed Choi, see such Korean-only policies as shameful. \u201cI would feel bad if I was refused entry because of my race,\u201d Choi said after seeing a group of foreigners being denied entry to the bar. \u201cUnder any circumstances, discrimination should not be allowed.\u201d Some observers said such a policy may reflect intentional racism, but could also be simply out of ignorance.\u201cKoreans are often not aware of what can amount to racial discrimination,\u201d an official from National Human Rights Commission of Korea said.The state-run watchdog has received a few complaints about discriminatory practices in the nightlife scene and opened investigations into the cases. \u201cBanning foreigners from a bar because of negative perceptions is not a reasonable reason for discrimination,\u201d the NHRC official said. \u201cSuch discrimination could be considered a human rights violation and racism.\u201d (Online Community)In 2014, a pub in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by foreigners, caused controversy after posting handwritten signs that read, \u201cWe apologize but due to the Ebola virus, we are not accepting Africans at the moment.\u201d The signs went viral on Twitter and Facebook, drawing fury from the expat community.\u201cRacial diversity is a relatively new concept in Korea and therefore xenophobia is not effectively punished,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut when the businesses owners learn it could be seen as discrimination, they quickly correct themselves.\u201d Bills such as an antidiscrimination law aimed at rooting out bigotry on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion have been submitted to the National Assembly since 2007 to uphold the Korean Constitution\u2019s value of equality. But they remain deadlocked in the face of Protestant groups\u2019 fierce resistance to equal rights for sexual minorities.\u201cWithout an antidiscrimination act, the human rights commission only has restricted power to fix discriminatory practices based on race,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enactment of the law could raise people\u2019s awareness of racism.\u201dAs of December 2015, 1.47 million foreign nationals reside in Korea, about 2.9 percent of the entire population of 51 million. \u201cKoreans get enraged about bars and clubs abroad discriminating against Asians. Somewhere else, we are also foreigners and outsiders. Everyone in Korea, whether poor or rich, Asian or white, is subject to freedom of choice,\u201d said Yang Eun-sun, public engagement manager at the Korea office of Amnesty International. \u201cBut we should be careful with the enactment of the antidiscrimination law because its loopholes could end up offering grounds for \u2018legal\u2019 discrimination.\u201d\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","1000":"The South Korean military said Saturday it has completed collecting debris from the three-stage rocket North Korea launched earlier this month, successfully collecting two pieces of debris presumed to be from the launch.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is difficult to collect other debris as they are dispersed in small pieces throughout the water.

She was 89.\u00a0\u00a0 A spokeswoman for Harper Collins in New York said Lee passed away peacefully late Thursday. The Pulitzer-winning author shunned the spotlight and spent her final years living in seclusion in Monroeville, Alabama, where she was born.\u00a0\u00a0 \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is considered one of the great classics of 20th century American literature, and is standard reading in classrooms across the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Published in 1960 and drawn from Lee's own experiences as a child, it came to define racial injustice in the Depression-era South. \u00a0\u00a0 It tells the story of a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman and the courageous lawyer, Atticus Finch, who defies his community to defend him.\u00a0\u00a0 The novel sold 30 million copies and earned huge critical acclaim, winning Lee a Pulitzer prize in 1961 and thrusting her into an avalanche of publicity.\u00a0\u00a0 Her fame was sealed when the novel was adapted into a Hollywood film that won three Academy Awards in 1963, including an Oscar for Gregory Peck for his portrayal of Finch, one of the best-loved characters in American fiction.\u00a0\u00a0 Former US president George W.

Her father was a lawyer and a direct descendant of Civil War general Robert E. Lee.\u00a0\u00a0 Lee grew up during the Great Depression in a remote village where the few available books provided the only entertainment. She never married, and books remained forever her first love.\u00a0\u00a0 Known as a tomboy as a child, she counted author Truman Capote among her childhood friends -- and often stood up for him when he was picked on as a sissy.

She also showed an early flair for writing even though her family hoped she would follow her father into law.\u00a0\u00a0 After a spell as an exchange student at Oxford University in England, she quit law school at The University of Alabama and headed for New York in 1949 to follow her dream of being a writer.\u00a0\u00a0 She worked for a while as an airline reservation clerk, until one Christmas when friends gave her enough money to live for a year without working so she could concentrate on writing.\u00a0\u00a0 Completed before \"Mockingbird,\" the draft she released last year as \"Watchman\" tells a similar tale of small-town racism but recounted from a different perspective.\u00a0\u00a0 While her famous novel is told through the eyes of Finch's young daughter, Scout, \"Watchman\" is narrated from the perspective of a grown-up Scout living in New York and coming home to the South for a troubled visit.\u00a0\u00a0 But critics pointed to a number of troubling inconsistencies between the two -- most notably that the hero Finch is portrayed in the manuscript as a man who harbors racist opinions.\u00a0\u00a0 The manuscript's release sparked a furious backlash -- partly because so little was known of Lee, who lived in a nursing home with a strictly controlled visitor list and who refused any request for interviews.\u00a0\u00a0 She did however quietly attend annual award ceremonies held by The University of Alabama for a writing contest inspired by her work.\u00a0\u00a0 Her sister, Alice, who was her gatekeeper until she died two years ago aged 103, explained in 2002 why her sister never seemed to make headway with a new work.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I'll put it this way.

It also hacked South Korea media organizations in March 2013, a month after its third nuclear test.North Korea carried out a fourth nuclear test last month, followed by a long-range rocket launch earlier this month.North Korea also has a track record of staging terror attacks against South Korea in the past few decades, including the 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Air flight that killed all 115 people aboard.

On Monday, Rep. Won Yoo-chul, the party's floor leader, called for nuclear armament, stressing that Seoul should start considering a \"strategy for survival\" to cope with Pyongyang's growing nuclear threats.Calls for nuclear armament have also been resonating in academia.Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute, enumerated a series of benefits from the South's nuclear armament in his contribution to Shindonga, a local monthly magazine.He argued that the South's nuclear armament would help address the North's nuclear threats and disparities in the inter-Korean military balance. It would also secure more autonomy in the hitherto asymmetric South Korea-U.S. alliance system and reduce defense spending and secure more money for the public welfare.\"There are more benefits than losses should South Korea be armed with a nuclear arsenal,\" he said in the contribution.\"In the face of North Korea's growing nuclear threats, time has come for the South to consider the issue of nuclear armament for self-defense -- rather than only relying on the U.S.' nuclear umbrella and U.S. Security Council resolutions of sanctions.\"Seoul has said that it is not considering nuclear armament.

Asked if he was speaking based on circumstantial assumptions without evidence, he conceded, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never stated that there were certain materials or evidence but did say that such concerns have been raised.\u201d But the testimony ran counter to his previous remarks. Appearing on a KBS show on Sunday, the minister reiterated that \u201cthere were various concerns and related materials\u201d but cannot disclose them because of intelligence matters. He even newly unveiled that about 70 percent of the Gaeseong proceeds was \u201cconfirmed through various channels\u201d to have been funneled into two offices run by the ruling Workers\u2019 Party to fund its nuclear and missile programs. Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee also said that the government has been monitoring through various channels and analyzing signs of the Gaeseong wages being siphoned off but refused to elaborate. \u201cThere have been concerns that the Gaeseong park wages were redirected for developing weapons of mass destruction. However, the international community has acknowledged the significance and effectiveness of the industrial park.

While the businesses operating in Gaeseong face bread-and-butter problems at hand, opposition lawmakers and experts demand sources of information, alleging a leap in logic and arguing that if the government does have proof, it would mean that it has in effect breached international resolutions banning support for Pyongyang\u2019s illicit military projects. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable he is now insisting that he has not claimed to have the documents,\u201d Kim Yeon-chul, a unification studies professor at Inje University, wrote on Facebook following the session.\u201cIt was already apparent that the government did not have the data, as seen through Hong\u2019s inconsistent remarks during last week\u2019s news conferences.

The network can be used wirelessly from North Korean territory, according to police.It is the same Internet network behind a cyberattack on South Korea's nuclear power operator in 2014, according to Kang. North Korea is suspected of orchestrating the attack, though it has denied the charges. Police said similar emails pretending to be from the presidential office or other government bodies have been sent from June 2015 to a total of 759 people.After probing into 460 of the recipients' occupations, police said 87.8 percent have jobs related to North Korea.\"Looking at the probe results, there is a trace of an intentional and deliberate targeting process that cannot be deemed as a coincidence,\" Kang said.Police also said some words in the mails are used only in North Korea.Although South and North Koreans speak the same language, South Koreans do not understand some North Korean expressions.The police chief said no major damage to national security has been confirmed due to the attack. Police said they are planning to conduct an international joint investigation as they found two European servers used to send other spam mails disguised as a notice from a major South Korean portal site.North Korea has a track record of waging cyber attacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.The latest hacking attempt came amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea claimed in January that it successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test.In response, South Korea is working with the U.S. and other regional powers to punish the communist country for its nuclear test and long-range missile launch that shortly followed the January provocation.\u00a0(Yonhap)","1021":"The international community should slap \"bone-numbing\" sanctions on North Korea over its nuke and missile provocations, the head of a South Korean presidential advisory panel said Monday.Yoo Ho-yeol, executive vice chairman at the National Unification Advisory Council, also stressed the importance of China's role in pressing Pyongyang into giving up its nuclear weapons development.\"Above all things, the international community should push for sanctions that will inflict severe pain to North Korea. Efforts to press China to join this effort are necessary,\" Yoo said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency.The U.N. Security Council is working on a fresh resolution for tougher sanctions against North Korea over its Jan. 6 nuclear test. On Feb. 7, the North launched a long-range rocket carrying what it claimed was a satellite, a move which Seoul and Washington view as a covert test for intercontinental ballistic missile technology.Yoo dismissed the view that sanctions imposed against the North so far have not been effective in reining in North Korea's reckless behavior. The North is already under a series of U.N. sanctions for its three nuke tests.\"It is a short-sighted view. If we slap sanctions against the North, unexpected effectiveness can be produced,\" he said, citing Washington's financial sanctions that hit Pyongyang hard in 2005.The U.S. blacklisted the Macau-based bank Banco Delta Asia for alleged counterfeiting and money laundering by North Korea. The move froze about $24 million worth of funds in North Korea's accounts at the BDA.Yoo said China needs to play a more active role in pressing the North into abandoning its nuke aspirations as Beijing's joining of the sanctions will effectively cut off a lifeline for North Korea.Touching on the North's leader Kim Jong-un, he warned that a \"serious\" security crisis can crop up as Kim is so erratic that he can pose a real threat to the Korean Peninsula.Yoo took office last month, replacing Hyun Kyung-dae who resigned in December amid allegations that he received illegal political funds.

We need to have a raincoat and wear it ourselves,\" Won said during a speech at the National Assembly.He was referring to the nuclear umbrella that the U.S. provides to South Korea after pulling its tactical nuclear weapons out of South Korea in 1991.In 1991, the two Koreas agreed to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free in a landmark deal, though North Korea has violated it by pursuing nuclear weapons programs.Won said North Korea's four nuclear tests, including the one last month, have rendered the denuclearization principle \"meaningless.\"Won's comments underscored growing calls among some conservative South Koreans to develop the country's own nuclear armaments amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.Won also supported the government's decision to shut down a factory park that South Korea had run jointly with North Korea in the North's border city of Gaeseong in response to the North's latest nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch.\"North Korea is obsessed with advancing its nuclear and missile programs with cash that had been flown\" through the factory park, he said.On Sunday, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo said he believes that North Korea has used wages paid to its workers at the factory park to develop nuclear and other military weapons.More than 120 firms annually provided about $100 million in total to North Korea for their workers' income. The cross-border project had served as a major legitimate revenue source for North Korea.The floor leader also called for parliamentary approval of a set of bills mean to revitalize the economy and reform the labor sector as the nation's economy faces a crisis.

No. 1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States,\" Rubio said.The No. 2 threat is the Middle Eastern problems, including the threat of the militant group Islamic State, and the third challenge is to rebuild and reinvigorate NATO in Central and Eastern Europe, where Russia is threatening the territory of multiple countries, Rubio said.Rubio is considered most active on North Korea issues among all U.S. presidential candidates. He has made a series of strong remarks on the communist nation since Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test followed by a long-range missile launch.The Florida senator co-sponsored a North Korea sanctions bill led by Sen.

Announcing a pullout from the Gaeseong industrial park last Wednesday, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo singled out Pyongyang\u2019s siphoning of its proceeds as the main rationale behind its decision. Since the compound\u2019s launch in 2004, South Korean cash totaling 616 billion won ($510.1 million) has been transferred chiefly to pay wages to North Korean employees, he noted.\u00a0Patriot missile system stationed at the Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. YonhapThe Unification Ministry went further Sunday, saying their salaries and other costs were delivered in U.S. dollars initially to North Korean authorities, which in turn meted out part of the funds to the workers in coupons. \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed through various channels that about 70 percent of the money has been handed over to the office of the secretary of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. The ministry\u2019s assertion was made to rationalize its decision to shut down the complex despite vehement opposition from the Gaeseong businesses and growing skepticism from the opposition and progressives over the timing and efficacy of the measure that was considered Seoul\u2019s last resort.During an appearance on broadcaster KBS earlier in the day, Hong also said the organization, together with the party central committee\u2019s \u201cOffice 39,\u201d is in charge of managing foreign currency to be spent on military and other prohibited purposes. \u201cWhen North Korea\u2019s party, government and military gets foreign currency, they would send it to the party secretary\u2019s office, or Office 39, which will then be used for nuclear and missile development and luxury goods purchases,\u201d he said. While diversion concerns have persisted for a while, the ministry\u2019s unveiling fueled fiery debate as it has now conceded to having knowingly infringed upon U.N. Security Council sanctions by publicly raising the connection between the Gaeseong earnings and Pyongyang\u2019s armament initiative. Resolution 2094, imposed after the communist state\u2019s third atomic experiment in February 2013, bans bulk cash transfers and requires states not to provide public financial support for trade \u201cif there is a link to North Korea\u2019s illicit programs.\u201d Hong\u2019s remarks also represented an about-face in the ministry\u2019s longstanding position that employee wages could not constitute a violation of the \u201cbulk cash\u201d article. A ministry official reaffirmed the stance to reporters even after Pyongyang\u2019s fourth nuclear test early last month. The assertion, coupled with its decision on the district\u2019s closure, would undermine the legitimacy of the Park Geun-hye administration\u2019s own policy that the factory park bears \u201cthe special nature of inter-Korean relations\u201d and thus should operate \u201cregardless of the political situation,\u201d experts say. In addition, as explained by its text and the U.S., the \u201cbulk cash\u201d clause was primarily designed to warn North Korean officials from working as \u201ccash couriers,\u201d such as using diplomatic pouches and their own briefcases. Critics also alleged a jump in logic and demanded the sources of the information, though Hong said during a news conference last Friday the government has \u201cvarious related materials, but could not tell everything,\u201d citing intelligence matters. \u201cThe ministry\u2019s argument lacks understanding of the North Korean finance structure. U.S. citizens are allowed to travel there and pay for food, lodging and other services in dollars, many of which are provided by the party and military, and the money will return to the facilities in kind or North Korean currency,\u201d Kim Yeon-chul, a unification studies professor at Inje University, wrote on Facebook on Sunday. \u201cAccording to the ministry\u2019s rationale, the U.S. government, too, may maintain that some of the dollars were diverted to the party secretary\u2019s office. But instead it has never barred its citizens from visiting North Korea. In international law, the concept of diversion doesn\u2019t apply the way the ministry thinks.\u201d Chong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy research at the Sejong Institute, said the party offices oversee incomes from numerous sources and the Gaeseong funds, if any, could only account for a fraction. \u201cGiven North Korea\u2019s total trade volume is about 70 times the revenues from Gaeseong, it will be a tremendous mistake to think that shutting down the complex would crush its nuclear ambitions,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than make the regime pay a \u2018severe price,\u2019 it will most probably deal a major blow to the 55,000 North Korean workers in Gaeseong, the 124 South Korean businesses, their 5,000 partner firms and all the 124,000 employees here.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1026":"The Sri Lankan Embassy held a National Day reception in early February to celebrate the 68th anniversary of independence from Britain and the development of ties with Korea.

This memory really hurts. It makes me very sad,\u201d said Kim, who described blueberry yogurt as the patient\u2019s favorite food.\u00a0 Three nurses, who treated MERS patients at the Seoul National University Hospital last year, pose for a photo during the interview. The interviewees asked that their names not be specified in the picture. Claire Lee\/The Korea HeraldIt has been more than six months since South Korea declared the de facto end of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak -- which infected 186 and claimed 38 lives here -- but nurses like Kim who cared for MERS patients are still feeling its impact. A number of her colleagues have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. A colleague, Hyun Jin-ah (not her real name), has had to take antidepressants and her condition has even led to her sending her eldest child to therapy sessions. The nurses plan to file industrial accident claims for the emotional damages they suffered during and after the outbreak. \u201cThere were no detailed guidelines. We were all new to the whole situation and I did not feel like I was being protected.\u201d Hyun told The Korea Herald. \u201cWe were not given any safety training before caring for MERS patients. Throughout the outbreak I barely slept and ate -- I constantly worried about what would happen to me if something went wrong, or if the situation got worse. Not knowing what to do and not having any guidelines to rely on made me incredibly anxious the whole time.\u201dIn the early stages of the outbreak, Kim, Hyun and their colleague Choi Eun-young were asked to care for MERS patients without proper protective gear, even when the patients were receiving aerosol-generating procedures. The procedures are known to expose health care workers to respiratory pathogens, thereby increasing the risk of contracting the associated infectious diseases. However, the nurses were told that wearing a facial mask would be enough. Kim found out a month later that when using nebulizers -- a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs -- on MERS patients, medical staff are actually required to use power air purifying respirators with a hood or helmet according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in the U.S. \u201cNo one told us anything,\u201d Kim said. \u201cOften I felt I could get infected at any minute and end up dying.\u201dThere were many situations in which the nurses did not feel safe. The nurses claim that the hospital did not do enough to protect its own staff. For instance, there was an incident in which a MERS patient threatened to kill the patient whom he had contracted the virus from. He would violently throw things when he was quarantined and felt frustrated about his condition. In another case, a stressed patient experienced a violent stroke. As it was crucial that he had to keep his intubation tube in -- he could have died if it fell out -- Hyun went into his room and tried to hold on to the tube until someone else came in to calm him down. She was kicked by the patient several times and was badly bruised. When she told her superior about this, she was told in return, \u201cYou knew (something like that would happen). So why did you go in (the room) in the first place?\u201d\u201cI did not know what to say to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWas I supposed to leave the patient alone knowing he could die if the tube fell out?\u201dDuring the outbreak, the nurses had to be separated from their families. As the hospital had seemingly made no plans to ensure their safety, the nurses had volunteered to stay away from their children and spouses. For two and a half months starting from June, they stayed in nonresidential rooms that had previously been used for research in the hospital. They were only given dehumidifiers and had no access to washing machines. \u201cWe would hand wash our clothes and cry before going to bed,\u201d Kim said.MERS patients had to be quarantined and nurses even had to take on responsibilities that were usually performed by other caregivers. On top of their usual daily duties, nurses had to perform extra tasks, such as cleaning rooms and washing patients\u2019 hair. They had to maintain reports of patients\u2019 medical histories, carry out treatments, administer medications and provide emotional support to patients. And as if this was not hard enough, fighting MERS literally made the nurses break into a sweat because of the protective gear they were required to wear. \u201cYou sweat a lot in the protective suit. You would be soaked in sweat after wearing it for 30 minutes,\u201d Kim said. \u201cOnce you wear the goggles, you can barely breathe. We would spend more than an hour in each patient\u2019s room. When you get out, you are completely dehydrated and extremely dizzy. When I tried to take a shower to maintain my personal hygiene (after taking the gear off), my superior said showers were not necessary.\u201dBeing cut off from their families was also not easy, and the nurses had to deal with social stigma against their family members. One nurse was contacted by her child\u2019s school teacher who suggested the child stay at home as his mother works at a hospital with MERS patients. \u201cWe were already separated from our families, and getting such text messages were hurtful,\u201d said Hyun. Upon returning home after two and a half months of staying in the hospital, Hyun found herself unable to control her emotions. She could not sleep either.\u201cI was always angry,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when my children were just being children -- running and laughing -- I would scream at them to be quiet.\u201d Hyun\u2019s youngest child, who suffered stress from being separated from her mother, would cry every morning when she tried to leave home for work. This lasted for two months. Her eldest son, 9, started to develop unusual habits, such as constantly rubbing his palms against one another. Hyun sought professional help and was diagnosed with PTSD. Her 9-year-old was diagnosed with a stress disorder. She was treated by a psychiatrist at the hospital where she worked, but her employer did not offer to pay for her or her son\u2019s treatment. Hyun\u2019s colleague, Choi, has had to deal with another kind of trauma. She felt that the MERS patient who was the 80th confirmed case in Korea had been unfairly treated. This patient had been suffering from cancerous lymphoma prior to contracting the virus. He was diagnosed with the virus on June 7 and was released from a quarantine facility on Oct. 3. Prior to this, he had tested negative for the virus twice consecutively.However, he was hospitalized on Oct. 11 at Seoul National University Hospital after experiencing symptoms once again. There, he was tested again for MERS. Choi claims that the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had held a press conference about the patient\u2019s positive test results on Oct. 12 before even informing the patient and his family. The KCDC told The Korea Herald that they are unable to confirm whether or not Choi\u2019s claims are true. \u201cIt was such a disrespectful thing to do,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThe patient learned about his test results on TV.\u201dOn Oct. 13, Choi went into the patient\u2019s room to check on him. He told her he had found out about his results by watching the news. He also mentioned that acquaintances who had met him in person before his hospitalization had called him to ask what they should do about their safety after finding out about his condition via the TV news. Choi remembers that the patient had looked visibly hurt. \u201cAnd then he told me it was his birthday,\u201d she said.As the patient was in quarantine, Choi was the only person who could visit him. She left the room and returned again with a birthday cake and a lit candle. Clad in protective gear, with the cake in her hands, Choi sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to the patient. He died about a month later on Nov. 25. He had wanted to see his 4-year-old son before his death, but his wish was never fulfilled. The South Korean government declared a formal end to the MERS outbreak on Dec. 23. \u201cThe memory of the patient\u2019s birthday pains me. I keep getting flashbacks. I still vividly remember his facial expressions that day,\u201d said Choi. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","1028":"Controversy is snowballing after Seoul claimed that the majority of its investment in a joint factory park has been funneled into North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, which critics say virtually marks a confession to its years-long self-contradictory breach of international resolutions. Announcing a pullout from the Gaeseong industrial complex last Wednesday, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo singled out Pyongyang\u2019s siphoning off of its proceeds as the main rationale behind its decision. Since the compound\u2019s launch in 2004, South Korean cash totaling 616 billion won ($511.4 million) has been transferred chiefly to pay wages to North Korean employees, he noted. The Unification Ministry went further Sunday, saying their salaries and other costs were delivered in U.S. dollars initially to North Korean authorities, which in turn meted out part of the funds to the workers in coupons. \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed through various channels that about 70 percent of the money has been handed over to the office of the secretary of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\u00a0 Officials standby at a support center set up by the Unification Ministry to offer help to businesses that operated at Gaeseong industrial park in Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)The ministry\u2019s assertion was made to rationalize its decision to shut down the complex despite vehement opposition from the Gaeseong businesses and growing skepticism from the opposition and the progressives over the timing and efficacy of the measure that was considered Seoul\u2019s last resort.During an appearance on broadcaster KBS earlier in the day, Hong also said the organization, together with the party central committee\u2019s so-called Office 39, is in charge of managing foreign currency to be spent on military and other prohibited purposes. \u201cWhen North Korea\u2019s party, government and military gets foreign currency, they would send it to the party secretary\u2019s office or Office 39, which will then be used for nuclear and missile development and luxury goods purchases,\u201d he said. While diversion concerns have persisted for a while, the ministry\u2019s unveiling fueled fiery debate as it has now conceded to having knowingly infringed upon U.N. Security Council sanctions by publicly raising the connection between the Gaeseong earnings and Pyongyang\u2019s armament initiative. Resolution 2094, imposed after the communist state\u2019s third atomic experiment in February 2013, bans bulk cash transfers and requires states not to provide public financial support for trade \u201cif there is a link to North Korea\u2019s illicit programs.\u201d\u00a0 A man walks past the portraits of the late North Korean leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, at the Kim Il-sung Square on Sunday in Pyongyang. (AP-Yonhap)Hong\u2019s remarks also represented an about-face in the ministry\u2019s longstanding position that employee wages could not constitute a violation of the \u201cbulk cash\u201d article. A ministry official reaffirmed the stance to reporters even after Pyongyang\u2019s fourth nuclear test early last month. The assertion, coupled with its decision on the district\u2019s closure per se, would undermine the legitimacy of the Park Geun-hye administration\u2019s own policy that the factory park bears \u201cthe special nature of inter-Korean relations\u201d and thus should operate \u201cregardless of the political situation,\u201d experts say. In addition, as explained by its text and the U.S., the \u201cbulk cash\u201d clause was primarily designed to warn North Korean officials working as \u201ccash couriers\u201d such as using diplomatic pouches and their own briefcases. Critics also alleged a jump of logic and demanded the sources of the information, though Hong said during a news conference last Friday the government has \u201cvarious related materials but could not tell everything,\u201d citing intelligence matters. \u201cThe ministry\u2019s argument lacks understanding of the North Korean finance structure. U.S. citizens are allowed to travel there and pay for food, lodging and other services in dollars, many of which are provided by the party and military, and the money will return to the facilities in kind or North Korean currency,\u201d Kim Yeon-chul, a unification studies professor at Inje University, wrote on Facebook on Sunday. \u201cAccording to the ministry\u2019s rationality, the U.S. government, too, may maintain that some of the dollars were diverted to the party secretary\u2019s office. But instead it has never barred its citizens from visiting North Korea. In international law, the concept of diversion doesn\u2019t apply the way the ministry thinks.\u201d Chong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy research at the Sejong Institute, said the party offices oversee incomes from numerous sources and the Gaeseong funds, if any, could only account for a fraction. \u201cGiven North Korea\u2019s total trade volume is about 70 times the revenues from Gaeseong, it will be a tremendous mistake to think that shutting down the complex would crush its nuclear ambitions,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than make the regime pay a \u2018severe price,\u2019 it will most probably deal a major blow to the 55,000 North Korean workers in Gaeseong, the 124 South Korean businesses, their 5,000 partner firms and the entire 124,000 employees here.\u201dBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1029":"Rep.

This memory really hurts. It makes me very sad,\u201d said Kim, who described blueberry yogurt as the patient\u2019s favorite food.\u00a0It has been more than six months since South Korea declared the de facto end of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak -- which infected 186 and claimed 38 lives here -- but nurses like Kim who cared for MERS patients are still feeling its impact. Three nurses, who treated MERS patients at the Seoul National University Hospital last year, pose for a photo during the interview. The interviewees asked that their names not be specified in the picture. (Claire Lee\/The Korea Herald)A number of her colleagues have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. A colleague, Hyun Jin-ah (not her real name), has had to take antidepressants and her condition has even led to her sending her eldest child to therapy sessions.\u00a0The nurses plan to file industrial accident claims for the emotional damages they suffered during and after the outbreak.\u00a0\u201cThere were no detailed guidelines. We were all new to the whole situation and I did not feel like I was being protected.\u201d Hyun told The Korea Herald.\u00a0\u00a0\"We were not given any safety training before caring for MERS patients. Throughout the outbreak I barely slept and ate -- I constantly worried about what would happen to me if something went wrong, or if the situation got worse. Not knowing what to do and not having any guidelines to rely on made me incredibly anxious the whole time.\u201dIn the early stages of the outbreak, Kim, Hyun and their colleague Choi Eun-young were asked to care for MERS patients without proper protective gear, even when the patients were receiving aerosol-generating procedures.\u00a0The procedures are known to expose health care workers to respiratory pathogens, thereby increasing the risk of contracting the associated infectious diseases. However, the nurses were told that wearing a facial mask would be enough.\u00a0Kim found out a month later that when using nebulizers -- a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs -- on MERS patients, medical staff are actually required to use power air purifying respirators with a hood or helmet according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in the U.S.\u00a0\u201cNo one told us anything,\u201d Kim said. \u201cOften I felt I could get infected at any minute and end up dying.\u201dThere were many situations in which the nurses did not feel safe. The nurses claim that the hospital did not do enough to protect its own staff.\u00a0For instance, there was an incident in which a MERS patient threatened to kill the patient whom he had contracted the virus from. He would violently throw things when he was quarantined and felt frustrated about his condition.\u00a0In another case, a stressed patient experienced a violent stroke. As it was crucial that he had to keep his intubation tube in -- he could have died if it fell out -- Hyun went into his room and tried to hold on to the tube until someone else came in to calm him down. She was kicked by the patient several times and was badly bruised. When she told her superior about this, she was told in return, \u201cYou knew (something like that would happen). So why did you go in (the room) in the first place?\u201d\u201cI did not know what to say to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWas I supposed to leave the patient alone knowing he could die if the tube fell out?\u201dDuring the outbreak, the nurses had to be separated from their families. As the hospital had seemingly made no plans to ensure their safety, the nurses had volunteered to stay away from their children and spouses.\u00a0For two and a half months starting from June, they stayed in nonresidential rooms that had previously been used for research in the hospital. They were only given dehumidifiers and had no access to washing machines.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe would hand wash our clothes and cry before going to bed,\u201d Kim said.MERS patients had to be quarantined and nurses even had to take on responsibilities that were usually performed by other caregivers.\u00a0On top of their usual daily duties, nurses had to perform extra tasks, such as cleaning rooms and washing patients\u2019 hair. They had to maintain reports of patients\u2019 medical histories, carry out treatments, administer medications and provide emotional support to patients.\u00a0And as if this was not hard enough, fighting MERS literally made the nurses break into a sweat because of the protective gear they were required to wear.\u00a0\u201cYou sweat a lot in the protective suit. You would be soaked in sweat after wearing it for 30 minutes,\u201d Kim said. \u201cOnce you wear the goggles, you can barely breathe. We would spend more than an hour in each patient\u2019s room. When you get out, you are completely dehydrated and extremely dizzy. When I tried to take a shower to maintain my personal hygiene (after taking the gear off), my superior said showers were not necessary.\u201dBeing cut off from their families was also not easy, and the nurses had to deal with social stigma against their family members.

Sources said it indicates North Korea has inched closer to fielding the road-mobile ICBM. The KN-08 missile seen at a military parade held in Pyongyang on April 15, 2012. YonhapLast week, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said North Korea \u201chas already taken initial steps toward fielding this (KN-08) system, although the system has not been flight-tested.\u201d Clapper also said Pyongyang was committed to developing \u201ca long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat\u201d to the United States.The KN-08 was first unveiled in a military parade in April 2012 celebrating the 100th birthday of Kim Il-sung, the North\u2018s founder.Strategic Forces now commands four strategic and tactical missile units. With North Korea apparently bolstering its missile programs, the commander of the Strategic Forces, Kim Rak-kyom, was promoted to the rank of four-star general late last year.The KN-08 is believed to have a range of at least 10,000 kilometers. In its annual report to Congress, the Pentagon said Friday if the KN-08 is properly designed and developed, it could be difficult to track because of its mobility.Elsewhere in its arsenal, North Korea is said to have produced more than 300 Nodong Missiles with a range of 1,200 kilometers, and about 30 Musudan missiles that can travel some 3,000 km. They are said to be capable of reaching the U.S. military bases in Japan and in the Pacific island of Guam, a U.S. territory. (Yonhap)","1032":"South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reached the consensus that the U.N. Security Council and the European Union should impose strong and effective sanctions on North Korea, an official said Saturday.Mogherini said the EU will join the international community's efforts to put pressure on North Korea and that it will consider tightening its own sanctions on the communist country, according to the South Korean official.Yun was in Germany for the Munich Security Conference. He also held back-to-back meetings with his counterparts from the U.S., China, Russia and Britain on the margins of the annual security conference.The four countries are crucial in adopting a resolution for sanctions as they are permanent veto-wielding members of the Security Council along with France.The meetings came as the Security Council has been working on a resolution to slap sanctions on North Korea over its recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.North Korea claimed the rocket was meant to put a satellite into orbit as part of its space development program. Still, South Korea, the United States and other regional powers view the North's satellite launch as a cover for testing its ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.South Korea has shuttered a factory park it had jointly run with North Korea in the North's border city of Kaesong following the North's rocket launch.The move is designed to cut off a major legitimate revenue source for North Korea and illustrated South Korea is serious about pushing for harsh international sanctions against North Korea.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has described South Korea's decisions as a brave and critical move.More than 120 South Korean firms annually had provided about $100 million in total to North Korea for the income of more than 54,300 North Koreans workers.Still, Mogherini did not express her clear-cut support for South Korea's shutdown of the last-remaining economic cooperation with North Korea, saying she fully understands the decision.Yun also met with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier and they also shared the need of imposing strong sanctions on North Korea.Steinmeier also said Germany is considering taking its own punitive measures against North Korea.

Yu Min-yeong (Song Sang-ho\/The Korea Herald)\u201cThe readiness would determine your utility of the \u2018golden hour\u2019 and post crisis resilience, which are absolutely important, as well as the speed.\u201d Yu picked wishful thinking and the hierarchy within organizations, both public and private, as two key culprits behind the recent series of nationwide crises, including the 2014 Sewol ferry tragedy and 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. \u201cThe two disasters raised alarm at the time, but as society returned to normal, the disasters did not lead to new preparations and rebuilding efforts. Instead there is the wishful thinking that it is possible to just get by even though another disaster might break out,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The 47-year-old expert made his foray into public affairs in the late 1990s as an aide to Kim Geun-tae, the late prominent democracy activist and liberal lawmaker. He also served the Roh Moo-hyun administration including as chief of the Cheong Wa Dae press center Chunchugwan. After working as the spokesperson of Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in 2012, he cofounded the Seoul-based consultancy. Yu also taught at Hallym University of Graduate Studies in Seoul and coauthored the April 2015 book, \u201cReputation Society.\u201dIn recent years, the concoction of smartphones and social media has brought a fundamental shift to communication dynamics, imposing a fresh interpretation to the term \u201cpublic,\u201d he said. \u201cI have learned about the world of public and political affairs from my previous careers especially at Cheong Wa Dae, but the influence of public opinion only continues to grow in the era of excess and unlimited connectivity,\u201d Yu said. \u201cFor companies, their media strategies had principal meaning as an advertising and promotion tool in the past. Now public opinion is an absolute variable to strategic communication and crisis management, with consumers being the \u2018subject,\u2019 not the \u2018object,\u2019 in the supply chain.\u201d Despite the prevalent numbness to potential crises, he has been sensing a subtle change in the views of corporate executives especially since Korean Air\u2019s \u201cnut rage\u201d incident in December 2014, Yu noted. Cho Hyun-ah, a member of the flag carrier\u2019s founding family and then its executive vice president, fanned a drumfire of nationwide criticism after being found to have ordered the pilot of her flight to return a taxiing plane to the gate to kick out the cabin crew chief at a New York airport for serving nuts in a way that she mistakenly insisted did not match the manual. The furor persisted despite her expressing her repeated regrets before cameras, and spilled over to the owner family, prompting her father and company chairman Cho Yang-ho to hold a news conference to apologize to the public and employees. The event highlighted South Koreans\u2019 inimical feelings toward the family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, and some of its offspring\u2019s \u201cimperialistic\u201d and arrogant behavior. \u201cGiving a lecture during a meeting of Samsung Group presidents last July, I felt that they were really trying to pay attention. I think the Korean Air case had a substantial impact,\u201d Yu said. \u201cThis area has previously been mainly in the interests of communication or public affairs staffs, but many of those at the top echelon are beginning to change since the incident, together with the explosive growth of smartphones, social networks and other areas that had not belonged to the realm of existing media.\u201dTo fend off crises and boost readiness, entities should make constant efforts to regularly update playbooks and carry out simulations, in which the resolve of top management and a consciousness change throughout society play a vital role, Yu stressed. \u201cCrisis management is something that the system and your body naturally remember. In that aspect, the current situation is much retrogressive especially within an administration in which everyone relies on the president and her belief and willingness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are no longer living in a world where leaders chant \u2018Follow me.\u2019 They now should understand their audience first and try to appeal to their hearts.\u201c By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","1034":"A South Korea's ruling party lawmaker called Friday for the removal of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a sign that underscores growing impatience in dealing with the dictator pursuing missile and nuclear programs.\"Everybody will be happy if Kim Jong-un is removed,\" Ha Tae-keung of the ruling Saenuri Party said in an interview with a local radio station.He also urged the international community to stand united in removing Kim as it did for former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In 2006, Hussein was executed for crimes against humanity.\"Kim Jong-un is a criminal,\" said the North Korean human rights activist-turned-lawmaker. \"Getting rid of a criminal is appropriate and does not violate international laws.\"The South Korean government did not react to Ha's call.International patience is wearing thin on North Korea over Kim's defiant pursuit of missile and nuclear weapons programs.North Korea launched a long-range missile on Sunday, about a month after it drew worldwide condemnation for its fourth nuclear test.In 1968, South Korea set up a commando unit to kill then North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, Kim's late grandfather, in retaliation for North Korea's assassination attempt on then President Park Chung-hee, the late father of current South Korean President Park Geun-hye.However, the unit's mission was called off at the last moment. In 1983, a deadly North Korean terrorist bombing targeted then South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan visiting Myanmar's old capital of Yangon.Chun escaped the attack thanks to traffic congestion, but the bomb ripped through a memorial, killing 17 South Koreans including Cabinet ministers.

Officials said the meeting will be called again Monday. (Yonhap)The opposition camp, on the other hand, reproached it as an unnecessary provocation. Some radical members went as far as to suggest the government and ruling camp may be taking advantage of the North Korean factor to kindle security issues ahead of the April general elections.\u201cThe total closure of the Gaeseong complex was an inevitable decision for the government to take under the circumstances,\u201d the ruling Saenuri Party\u2019s chief spokesperson Rep.

It is typically considered to be in the favor of the conservative party in power when a national security threat takes place before a key election.The ruling party also stressed that the recent military provocations from the North added to the legitimacy of the pending terrorism prevention bill.\u201cIf a terrorist attack were to take place right now, who would then be held responsible?\u201d posed party leader Rep.

A 15-year-old appeared separately at a juvenile court to face the same charge, local channel Cable TV reported.Police arrested a total of 64 people after the street battle, which erupted late Monday in densely populated Mong Kok and lasted until dawn Tuesday.\u00a0Activists were angered by authorities' attempts to crack down on food hawkers selling fishballs and other local delicacies for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Officers responded with batons and pepper spray. One officer fired two warning shots into the air, a highly unusual act in Hong Kong, which otherwise has a reputation for being extremely safe. Nearly 90 officers and four reporters were injured.It was the worst violence in Hong Kong since late 2014, when the city was rocked by pro-democracy protests that left a widening trust gap between the public and the city's Beijing-backed leader.Police said 16 other people, including one as young as 14, were released on bail as they continue to investigate.

The previous day, Seoul announced the suspension of the factory park as a retaliatory step following Pyongyang\u2019s recent nuclear and rocket tests. The decision to shut down the complex, a symbol of cross-border reconciliation and cooperation, has sparked concerns that bilateral tensions could spiral out of control and Seoul\u2019s trust-building efforts may be headed down the drain.The South Korean firms operating in the complex sent one truck each to Gaeseong to bring to the South their finished products, production materials, equipment and other belongings, while Seoul authorities vowed to try their utmost to minimize possible damages to firms.An additional 130 South Koreans entered the complex to prepare for the suspension of factory operations. There were 70 more South Koreans in the park from the previous day as more workers were sent to carry out the government\u2019s withdrawal instructions.Apparently in line with Pyongyang\u2019s instructions, North Korean workers did not show up at the park, Seoul officials said. Some 55,000 North Korean workers worked at the complex through which Pyongyang raked in around $100 million annually. Factory owners have expressed concerns that they would have to shut down their businesses as they would fail to meet their respective deadlines for supplying goods to clients. South Korean employees would also feel apprehensive about their impending unemployment.\u201cI feel bitter when I think about the possibility that I might lose my job due to the suspension of the factory operations,\u201d said Yun Sang-eun, a worker who drove a 22-ton truck back to the South with factory products from Gaeseong. Later in the day, South and North Korean officials in charge of management of the complex held consultations over the procedures of the pullout. Observers say they could be at odds over various issues including those concerning Seoul\u2019s cuts in the supply of electricity and water to the complex.A senior official at Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry said that the pullout decision was an \u201cadministrative act that was carried out for public interest based on highly political judgment.\u201d \u201cThis (pullout) decision is to ensure the safety of our citizens, end the vicious circle of provocations and pressure Pyongyang to change course,\u201d he told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.\u201cThe government would offer the maximum support to the firms who would sustain damages in the process of pulling out of the complex.\u201dHis remarks came after a progressive association of local lawyers demanded that the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae and the Unification Ministry explain the \u201clegal grounds\u201d on which they decided to close the Gaeseong park.The association argued that the government\u2019s decision restricts corporate activities and the property rights of companies operating in Gaeseong, hence it should be made according to clear legal grounds, and implemented through legitimate procedures.In the afternoon, vice ministers of related government agencies held a meeting to discuss ways to support South Korean companies that are expected to suffer damages due to the suspension of factory operations in Gaeseong.They formed a special task force to support the firms.

The two Inter-Korean communication hotlines will be also cut off, it added.The North's announcement came one day after South Korea announced plans to shut down the factory zone, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, in response to the North's latest nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.Seoul's move is part of its \"bone-numbing\" measures against North Korea's nuclear test on Jan. 6 and its long-range missile launch earlier this week.On Sunday, the North launched a long-range rocket carrying a satellite, which Seoul and Washington view as a cover for a banned test of intercontinental ballistic technology.South Korea \"will experience what disastrous and painful consequences will be entailed by its actions,\" the North's committee said.A total of 124 South Korean companies are operating in the zone, some 50 kilometers northwest of Seoul, employing more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.The complex, opened in 2004, has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has benefited from cheap but skilled North Korean labor.

The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the North\u2019s government body that deals with inter-Korean affairs, pledged on Thursday to immediately expel all South Korean nationals from the park.

Their conflict peaked in 1950 when the communist North\u2019s then-leader Kim Il-sung invaded the South with ambitions to unify the peninsula by force, starting the three-year Korean War.It was only in 1990 that the two states finally sat down at the same table and adopted the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement and pledged nonaggression and exchange.Despite the hard-reached agreement, however, inter-Korean relations remained frigid throughout the 1990s, mostly due to the North\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1993.The game-changer was liberal President Kim Dae-jung who, after a series of unfruitful vice-ministerial talks, succeeded in holding the first-ever summit with his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il in 2000.\u00a0Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung meets late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il at Sunan Airport in Pyongyang, North Korea for the first inter-Korean summit held in June 2000.

China, North Korea's main political ally and economic benefactor, has reportedly cut coal and iron ore imports from the neighboring country amid falling raw material prices worldwide.During the reign of Kim's late father and leader Kim Jong-il, an average of 56,800 workers were sent to China each year between 2005 and 2011.

He also vowed to \"make nuclear strikes at the enemies from anywhere on the ground, in the air, at sea and underwater.\"Kim also said his country has made nuclear warheads small enough to fit on ballistic missiles in an apparent threat to Seoul and Washington, which recently began their annual joint military drills.

(Yonhap)","1073":"South Korea will elect the new 20th National Assembly members on April 13. The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on the candidate agendas, election trends and notable runners leading up to the race. This is the first installment. -- EdLeading a campaign based on welfare measures is certainly a tempting strategy for political parties\u00a0in an election season.Progressive parties have used the strategy to distinguish themselves from conservatives and criticize excessive capitalist growth drives. The conservative camp, on the other hand, adopts welfare plans to prove a balanced policy portfolio.But in either case, such buoyant promises come with a critical question: How\u00a0will these costly social support programs be financed?Indeed, several of the welfare pledges that have successfully won votes in recent years have boomeranged against the initiating party, mostly due to a lack of funds. Voters, too, have grown skeptical over the rosy promises of free child care, school meals and pension benefits.These side effects may explain why welfare agenda have been swept aside this year, as the nation heads toward a general election to pick National Assembly members\u00a0for the next four years.Welfare, key election determinant in 2010-2012In the elections from\u00a02010-2012, political parties had every reason to prioritize welfare in their campaigns in response to growing demands for stronger social protection.The education superintendent election in 2010, the Seoul mayoral by-election in 2011, the parliamentary elections and the presidential election in 2012 were all won by the party or candidate who took the lead in welfare issues.As progressive candidates swept the 2010-2011 elections with pledges of free school meals and\u00a0halving college tuition fees, the ruling Grand National Party decided to undercut the liberal drive by taking the initiative.After replacing its supreme council with an emergency committee led by then-Rep. Park Geun-hye and changing its longtime name to the current Saenuri Party, the conservatives made the unconventional move to announce an extensive child care program, called the \u201cNuri\u201d curriculum.Not only did it revise the infant care act to increase the state subsidies for child care, but it also pledged to expand the free child care beneficiaries to 3-year-olds, and eventually to all age groups.This was a drastic expansion of the original plan devised by the former Lee Myung-bak administration benefitting 5-year-olds before gradually moving on to younger age groups.These groundbreaking welfare policies caused a stir, as well as scornful counterattacks from the opposition, but they had their intended effect -- the Saenuri Party secured its majority in the assembly in 2012.\u00a0 Park Geun-hye, the then-candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party, delivers her state-funded child care pledges to the audience during the presidential election campaign in November 2012. (The Korea Herald)Leader Park Geun-hye, too, earned credit for saving the party from crisis and for redirecting the party\u2019s interest toward people\u2019s livelihoods. Her presidential campaign mantra was based on two key terms -- \u201ceconomic democratization\u201d and \u201cwelfare\u201d -- which later contributed to her victory.Policy boomerangBut over recent years, the financial consequences of these generous welfare programs have gone out of control, with the government and ruling party are struggling to patch them\u00a0up.The greatest problem for the ruling bloc is the strife between the central government and local education superintendents over the state-initiated Nuri curriculum.Due to the Park Geun-hye administration\u2019s low-taxation stance, the program soon came to face a lack of funding, which then led to a standoff over who was to take financial responsibility.The\u00a0central government claims local offices should allocate their share of the budget, as stated in the ordinance. But superintendents\u00a0argue that child care centers are classified as nurseries, and thus supervised by the Welfare Ministry instead of the Education Ministry.This child care dispute brought criticism against the president for pushing ahead with an extensive welfare blueprint without a matching\u00a0funding plan\u00a0or sufficient consultation with local governments.A standout example of\u00a0the trouble for the ruling camp is the ongoing war with progressive welfare-driven Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong.Late last year, the local assembly of Seongnam passed a series of welfare bills, providing free postnatal care for new mothers, free uniforms for middle school freshmen and special subsidies for young job seekers.The mayor claimed the measures were within legal boundaries, citing the duty of the central or local government to improve citizens\u2019 welfare. But his bold actions have rubbed the presidential office and the ruling party up the wrong way. The administration, which once touted grand welfare pledges as a prerequisite responsibility of the state, started branding it as populism.\u201cWhen a local government runs (welfare) businesses that it cannot afford, the (financial) consequences will be borne by the state,\u201d said President Park last month, as she also labeled Mayor Lee\u2019s welfare policies \u201cpopulist.\u201dThe president also passed through the Cabinet meeting an ordinance to cut back on the subsidy for local governments that introduced a social security system without consulting the central government in advance.\u201cThese populist policies that abuse people\u2019s taxes for the sake of the mayor\u2019s personal interest are like a sweet poison, leading the country and the people to breakdown,\u201d were the words of Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung.But Mayor Lee refuted, saying his actions would have been in line if only the president and ruling party had not reversed their earlier pledges for people\u2019s welfare.\u201c(The Saenuri Party) promised welfare without extra taxation, which turned out to be a lie,\u201d Lee said in a radio interview Monday.\u201cPresident Park, too, spoke of a basic pension for all those aged 65 or above, but now she is taking back her words.\u201dThe ruling party made its rebuttal, but the dispute over welfare served as a reminder to voters that several of the party\u2019s welfare vows remain unfulfilled.Parties dodge welfare talk in generalThe Saenuri chief may be known for his outspokenness, but his offense against the Seongnam Mayor\u2019s welfare plans was by no means his personal opinion. It reflected the party\u2019s growing reluctance to prioritize welfare amid limited financial resources and prolonged slow growth.A report by the party\u2019s think tank the Youido Institute last year said that as a means to exit the low growth phase, the government should \u201cincrease the level of economic freedom and reduce welfare.\u201dQuoting the cases of Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the report claimed that most advanced countries were held back in terms of economic development due to their \u201cexcessive welfare systems.\u201dIt is not just the ruling conservatives that have shied away from the welfare agenda. The progressive main opposition party, too, has toned down its stance.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which is now The Minjoo Party of Korea, issued an election strategy report last year and fingered \u201ctolerant growth\u201d rather than \u201cuniversal welfare\u201d as the top policy goal.Even former chief Rep. Moon Jae-in has been reiterating the concept of \u201cincome-led growth,\u201d placing growth over welfare.This has led to suspicion that the opposition party has lost some of the progressive color it claimed to have, but some experts point out that welfare should not be considered a yardstick of progressiveness.According to the late Harvard historian Sydney Fay, the very concept of state welfare dates from German chancellor Otto von Bismarck and French Emperor Napoleon III in the 1870s. Both highly conservative rulers came up with insurance systems for the socially disadvantaged class so as to discourage them from turning to socialism.Libertarian economist Richard McKenzie, too, pointed out that \u201cthe welfare state is necessary for the continued collective acceptance of the free market system.\u201d Without a soothing mechanism, workers may end up resisting a free economy, which will then cost more in terms of growth than in welfare costs, he explained in his book \u201cFairness of the Market.\u201d\u201cWhat really counts in welfare is the existence of a sustainable system,\u201d said Ahn Sang-hoon, professor for social policy studies at Seoul National University.\u201cWe should pay more attention to whether welfare is forming a virtuous circle with the nation\u2019s economy or whether the level of benefits is in line with the people\u2019s tax burden, instead of disputing individual policy contents.\u201dBy Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1074":"A Seoul Court rejected on Tuesday logistics companies' requests for an injunction to halt social commerce giant Coupang\u2019s free delivery system.

Only in 2009 and 2014 did it shrink on-year.The KDI report attributed the sharp decline to sluggish raw material exports, as shipments of anthracite coal and iron ore fell 6.3 percent and 68.5 percent, respectively.\"The chilly relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing and a slowdown in the Chinese economy seemed to affect North Korea's sluggish trade with China,\" said the report. \"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's New Year message, which called for using home-made products and rejecting foreign-made ones, also had some influence on the downbeat trend.\"The alliance between Pyongyang and Beijing had been described as being \"forged in blood,\" since China fought alongside North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. China is the only country that provides crude oil to the reclusive North.But their political relations have become strained since 2013, partly because of the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons and a series of purges of pro-Chinese officials in North Korea.For 2016, the KDI report noted that there is a higher possibility that bilateral trade will contract further following Pyongyang's nuclear tests on Jan. 6, as the global community including the United Nations is set to impose sanctions against the reclusive regime.\"North Korean trade will be dragged down by international economic sanctions sparked by the North's latest nuclear test in the first half of this year,\" the KDI said. \" North Korea-China trade has shrank to some extent, following sanctions by the U.N.\" (Yonhap)","1081":"A\u00a0senior U.N. rights official expressed concerns Friday that the Korean authorities were stifling the rights to public assembly and free speech.\u00a0Maina Kiai (Yonhap)Maina Kiai, the special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, took issue with the government\u2019s use of law and public force to restrict public assemblies and association, as well as a lack of dialogue channels between the authorities and citizens.\u00a0\u201cI heard government officials repeatedly cite people\u2019s \u2018inconvenience\u2019 as a rationale for restricting protests. They have also cited security challenges (from North Korea) as a reason for limiting rights,\u201d Kiai said in a press briefing held on Friday afternoon in central. \u201cBut they should not be an excuse for unduly limiting rights.\u201d\u201cI am confident that the government has the capacity to get it right.\u201d The Kenyan human rights lawyer visited the country from Jan. 21-29 to investigate possible violations of the rights to public assembly and free speech after an association of civic groups filed a petition with the U.N. In recent months, Koreans took to the streets to protest against the Park administration\u2019s push to adopt state-authored history textbooks, reform the labor market and open the agricultural sector, which led to police firing water cannon mixed with tear gas into the crowd. The police water cannon blast left Baek Nam-gi, a 69-year-old activist, unconscious at a hospital.\u201cCertain police tactics during assemblies concern me, such as the use of water cannons and bus barricades,\u201d Kiai said in the briefing. \u201cBut aggression only begets aggression.\u201dProtestors have lashed out at the police for abusing its authority to silence criticism of the government, while police have stressed its role in maintaining public order. Following a series of anti-government protests last year, thousands of citizens faced questioning on charges of violating the demonstration act, disrupting traffic and using violence during protests. \u201cIt is important that the government and protestors build trust to prevent violence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe authorities should guarantee people are not punished for participating in peaceful assemblies. Rights should come before restrictions.\u201d During his visit, the U.N. special rapporteur visited labor union groups, minor political parties, and representatives of sexual minorities and civic groups. He met with the bereaved families of the victims of the Sewol ferry tragedy and students staging an outdoor sit-in outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to protest the relocation of the memorial for sex slavery victims by Japan during World War II. In an effort to seek a balanced view, Kiai also consulted government officials from the Foreign Ministry, Labor Ministry, Justice Ministry, as well as officials from the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and the nation\u2019s Human Rights Commission. Kiai plans to write a report on Korea and submit it to the United Nations Human Rights Council in June.

(Yonhap)","1083":"South Korea's former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo received an 8-month jail term Friday for receiving bribes from a deceased businessman.Still, the Seoul Central District Court suspended the sentence for two years and ordered him to forfeit 30 million won ($27,000).Lee, who stepped down in April after mounting suspicion, was convicted of taking 30 million won at his election office in April2013 from Sung Wan-jong, the late chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Inc.\"The authenticity of the recorded interview of Sung Wan-jong and credibility of statements made by secretaries can all be accepted,\" the court said. A corruption scandal flared up after Sung left a note and a recorded interview claiming that he gave money to eight politicians, including Lee and Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province, as well as President Park Geun-hye's former and current chiefs of staff.Prosecutors indicted Lee and Hong in July 2015 while not prosecuting the others, citing a lack of evidence and the statute of limitations.\"The justice department accepted every single claim made by the prosecutors, but I am innocent,\" Lee told reporters after the ruling was delivered, adding he will appeal.Sung hanged himself on April 9 just hours before a court hearing that would have determined the legality of his arrest regarding his embezzlement charges.
