bills, but only without disputed labor and economic bills. The revised election bill to redraw electoral districts, also remained up in the air.Parliamentary Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, who had refused to push ahead with the bill on his own authority, said that he would submit his version for review to the National Election Commission at midnight.\u201cThere will be a legislative emergency situation starting from midnight, when the current constituency system loses its binding power,\u201d Chung told reporters on Thursday morning.His plan will involve keeping the number of regional parliamentary seats at the current 246 and that of proportional representatives at 54.Chung\u2019s bill is expected to undergo a review by the commission, which will then resubmit it to the Assembly for endorsement by Jan. 8. National Assembly on Dec. 31. YonhapIn a New Year address, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her calls for the swift passage of pending bills.\u201cI will complete the three-year economic innovation plan and also achieve reforms in the public sector, finance, education and labor,\u201d Park said.The president had repeatedly underlined that the pending bills were crucial to improve the nation\u2019s economy, create jobs and promote public safety.While the government and the ruling party continued to call for the passage of what they referred to as the people\u2019s welfare bills, the opposition camp vowed to block them, which they saw as aggravating inequality and job insecurity.\u201cThe Minjoo Party is the only party that may suggest an alternative to the working class,\u201d Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in said in his New Year\u2019s address.His Saenuri counterpart, meanwhile blasted the main opposition for holding back the economic and labor reform bills.\u201cThe opposition party will face the people\u2019s judgment in the general election for blocking the nation\u2019s economic improvement,\u201d said Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung at the Supreme Council meeting.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","1":"Ewha Womans University Medical Center said Wednesday it had opened the Organ Transplantation Center to provide a wide range of services for patients who need organ transplants. One of the nation\u2019s leading medical institutes said that the specialized center in southwestern Seoul was part of the EUMC\u2019s efforts to sharpen its competitiveness in organ transplants -- one of its key fields of expertise -- before unveiling its second hospital in Seoul in 2018.Headed by director and surgeon Jung Gu-yong, the Organ Transplantation Center has expanded medical staff specializing in carrying out heart and lung transplants.Jung stressed the need for a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d system to manage various organ transplants to accumulate expertise and know-how in the transplant sector. \u201cWe plan to focus on expanding our medical services into heart (and) lung transplants based on our know-how in kidney and liver transplants,\u201d Jung said. \u201cIt is important to successfully conduct an organ transplant surgery through intensive care. But it is also important to make the surgery successful in the long term by closely checking on the state of patients\u2019 health through immune system modulation and nutritive controls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make the utmost efforts to provide top quality medical services for patients waiting for organ transplants.\u201dFounded in 1887 by an American missionary as the nation\u2019s first women-only hospital, it has run several specialized centers, including the Cancer Center for Women, known for its contribution to treating breast, ovarian and other cancers affecting women.By Ock Hyun-ju(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","2":"The newly elected chief of the United Nations maritime body will start his four-year term in the beginning of next year, the South Korean government said Thursday.Lim Ki-tack, a former head of South Korea's local port operator, was elected in June to head the International Maritime Organization.Lim will replace Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu to become the 9th IMO secretary-general starting Jan. 1.His inauguration was approved unanimously by the IMO's general assembly last month, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.He has served in multiple positions in and outside the IMO, including as chairman of the subcommittee on Implementation of IMO Instruments (formerly the FSI) from 2002-2005.\"I will go through thorough organization analysis and assessment to make the IMO become a more transparent and efficient international agency,\" Lim was quoted as saying.The IMO is the leading global authority on safety, security and environmental issues in the international shipping industry. South Korea joined the organization in 1962. (Yonhap)","3":"Most Chinese people believe that Beijing should not accept conditions set by South Korea and Japan in possibly resolving the long-running grievance of Chinese victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, a survey by a state-run Chinese media showed Thursday. The online survey, conducted by the Global Times, published by the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, found that 95 percent of 10,686 respondents say the deal between South Korea and Japan on wartime sex slaves \"can't\" apply to China. The remaining 5 percent say the deal \"can\" apply to possible talks between Japan and China in resolving the issue of Chinese victims who were forcibly mobilized at front-line Japanese military brothels during World War II.Under the deal with South Korea announced on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologized to the Korean victims and Tokyo agreed to provide 1 billion yen (US$8.3 million) to a fund for the victims.The deal, hailed by both South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Abe, paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to solve one of their thorniest issues. The deal was in line with diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a united front with South Korea and Japan against China's increasingly assertive behaviors and North Korea's defiant pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons. While the deal was welcomed in Washington, China's state-run media cast a wary eye on the deal, calling it insincere. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also China and other parts of Asia, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II.

According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government\u2019s survey that included 760 foreigners from October to November, the satisfaction rate stood at 4.56 out of 5 points. The surveyed queried participants on three parts: accessibility and cleanness of the facility; hospitality and expertise of center employees; and contents of programs. The support centers received the highest score in daily support with 4.59 points, followed by business support and work-related support with 4.54 points and 4.52 points, respectively. Daily living support covers general counseling, language education and help overcoming cultural differences, officials said. Among the facility users, Chinese users made up the biggest group, with 21.2 percent, followed by Chinese with Korean ancestry with 12.5 percent and Southeast Asians with 11.4 percent. Chinese and Chinese with Korean ancestry tended to look for help related to work the most, while Japanese, Europeans and Americans sought daily living support, they added.  The city currently runs 19 foreign support centers across the city. It also jointly runs 24 similar organizations with the Gender Equality Ministry in the city.

The 55-year-old man, identified only by his surname Chung, stormed into the office of Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party of Korea -- formerly the New Politics Alliance for Democracy -- in the country's second-largest city of Busan, with a weapon at around 9:10 a.m.Moon was not at the local office as he was in Seoul to participate in a memorial ceremony of a former lawmaker.Chung claimed to be a younger brother of a renowned documentary writer, according to police.After bounding one of Moon's aides with tape, the offender poured paint thinner on the floor of the office and threw a fire extinguisher out a window.He demanded that Moon be arrested, but his exact motive is still being investigated.The one-hour long hostage situation ended without any casualties, as the offender turned himself in to the police outside the building. \"Everything is done now. I will tell everything at the police station and prosecutors' office,\" he said. Police said they will investigate the details of the incident, including the reason he committed the crime.

Ahn announced that he will create a new party next month.

He was 73.Kim Yang-gon, the head of the United Front Department at the ruling Workers' Party, died in car accident at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to the North's Korean Central News Agency.The KCNA called Kim \"the closest comrade-in-arms\" of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying that North Korea will hold a state funeral for Kim on Thursday, to be headed by the North's leader.Kim Yang-gon was one of the two ranking North Korean officials who attended the rare inter-Korean high-level talks in August following heightened tensions sparked by a land mine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.The two Koreas reached a rare deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tensions and make efforts to promote inter-Korean civilian exchanges.But inter-Korean ties have remained strained since the two sides ended their high-level talks on Dec. 12 without producing any agreements.South Korea's government said it offered condolences over Kim's death earlier in the day in the name of Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.\"The government expressed condolences over the death of Kim who contributed to a meaningful agreement at the August talks,\" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.Jeong refrained from commenting on the immediate impact of his death on inter-Korean affairs, adding that a closer watch is needed.Analysts said that Seoul-Pyongyang ties may continue to be strained in the short term due to the death of Kim, a dialogue-seeking figure.\"Kim's unexpected death is feared to lead to the prolonged suspension of inter-Korean talks,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. \"Given that the high-level talks fell apart in December, there is a chance that Seoul-Pyongyang ties may be further strained.\"Kim had mainly dealt with inter-Korean affairs since the regime of Kim Jong-il, the father of the North's current leader, who died in late 2011.In 2007, Kim was named the head of the party's United Front Department, which manages Pyongyang's relations with Seoul. He also contributed to creating an inter-Korean summit held between Kim Jong-il and then-South Korean President Ro Moo-hyun in October of that year.Since Kang Sok-ju, a secretary handling international relations for the North's ruling party, remains ill, Kim was known as effectively doubling up with Kang's jobs at the party.North Korea announced a list of members for the funeral committee for Kim, including Choe Ryong-hae, a senior secretary of the ruling party and a key aide to the North's leader.In November, Choe was sent to a rural farm as punishment for his mishandling of a newly built hydroelectric power plant project.The inclusion of his name on the list may indicate that Choe has been reinstated.The Unification Ministry declined comment on Choe's status.Despite the troubling news, North Korea has not shown any abnormal signs on the military front, a military official said. \"The country has freshly entered the winter training season, but the training pattern is the same as those of previous years,\" the official said. \"No abnormal signs have been detected lately among North Korean troops.\" (Yonhap)","9":"The South Korean government said Tuesday it repatriated three North Korean fishermen who were rescued in the East Sea this week.\"Our Coast Guard found a North Korean boat drifting in the East Sea and rescued three crew members there,\" the unification ministry said in a release.\"We handed them over to the North at around 6:50 p.m. today through the truce village of Panmunjeom, as they all expressed their wish to return home,\" it added. The boat, which departed from the North's port city of Wonsan, was drifting due to engine failure, according to the ministry.\u00a0 (Yonhap)","10":"Three out of 10 large businesses in South Korea are voicing worries over the possibly of worsening relations with labor unions next year due in part to the ongoing controversy over the government-led labor reform drive, a poll showed Tuesday.In a survey conducted by the Korea Employers Federation of its 304 member companies, 67.1 percent of respondents expected labor-management relations to destabilize further next year.Of those polled, 46.2 percent cited the ongoing controversy over the government's labor reform drive, which has been pending in the National Assembly.In September, labor, management and the government reached a landmark deal to ease labor restrictions and allow companies to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming, which is criticized by some for making it easy for businesses to fire their workers.Major businesses also worried that their annual wage talks with labor unions for next year will start later, and the period of talks will also likely be prolonged. Nearly 65 percent of those surveyed said that their annual wage talks will likely last for an average of 3-4 months next year, with 33 percent saying that labor unions' demands for pay raises and other working conditions will be concentrated after July. (Yonhap)","11":"Japanese civic groups said Tuesday that a South Korea-Japan deal on Tokyo's wartime sex slavery is insufficient to heal the pains of Korean victims, raising doubts about whether Japan has sincerely apologized for its atrocity.South Korea and Japan reached a rare deal Monday to resolve the issue of South Korean women coerced into sex slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.The deal included Japan's apology for Korean victims and a 1 billion yen ($8.29 million) fund to be created with Japan's money, but it failed to specify Japan's legal responsibility for the issue.Civic groups in Japan said that the agreement is a step forward, as their government admitted its responsibility for the matter for the first time. But it is disappointing that the deal was ambiguous on the Japanese government's specific role in forcing Korean women into sexual servitude, they said.\"It is meaningful that Japan recognized its accountability for the first time. But the deal never went beyond Japan's 1993 apology over the matter, known as the Kono Statement,\" Mina Watanabe, general secretary of the Women's Active Museum on War and Peace in Japan, told Yonhap News Agency.In the 1993 statement, Japan acknowledged and apologized for its military's \"involvement\" in the wartime wrongdoings, but it did not state the Japanese government and military's leading roles in \"coercing\" Korean women into sexual servitude.\"It is questionable whether Japan had the sincerity to apologize for the issue, as it demands that the statue of a girl symbolizing such victims be removed from outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul,\" she said. \"If Japan really wants to heal their pains, it should have not made such a request.\"Hisatomo Kobayashi, a senior official at the Truth-Seeking Network for Forced Mobilization in Japan, cast a similar view.\"The Seoul-Tokyo deal failed to clarify the fact that Japan and its military took the leading role in forcing women into sexual servitude,\" Kobayashi said. \"I don't think Japan sincerely apologized to the victims, given that it did not clearly recognize this fact.\" (Yonhap)","12":"North Korea criticized South Korea Tuesday for reaching a deal with Japan over Tokyo's wartime sex slavery, calling it a \"humiliating agreement\" that missed holding the Japanese state responsible for such atrocities.A day earlier, Seoul and Tokyo reached a rare deal to resolve the issue over Korean women forced into Japan's sex slaves during World War II. The agreement included Japan's apology for Korean victims and a 1 billion yen ($8.29 million) fund to be created with Japan's money, but it failed to specify Japan's legal responsibility for the issue.The Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification rebuked South Korea for agreeing to the deal with Japan, dubbing it \"humiliating diplomacy.\"\"For South Korea, there is no more humiliating diplomacy than to reach such a deal with Japan. South Korea views the issue as being resolved finally and irreversibly, even though Japan did not state its legal responsibility in the matter,\" it said in a statement carried by North Korea's Chosun Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper based in Japan.The association is under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, known as Chongryon, which represents North Korean interests in Tokyo.North Korea has claimed that there are victims of Japan's sex slavery in the North as well, calling on Japan to recognize its state responsibility for the issue.The North said that Japan should admit its state accountability for the \"hideous crimes\" it committed during its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, calling for resolutions in such a manner as to be \"understandable to all Koreans.\" (Yonhap)","13":"South Korea's ruling and opposition parties showed mixed responses Monday to the outcome of talks between the top diplomats of Seoul and Tokyo on the issue of Korean women forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese army during World War II. \u00a0\u00a0 Evaluating the deal as significant progress, the ruling Saenuri Party called for the Japanese government's diligent and specific course of action to fulfill the agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is a deal with considerable improvement in that the responsibility of the Japanese government has been stipulated,\" Lee Jang-woo, a spokesman of the ruling party, said. \u00a0\u00a0 The remarks came during a press briefing held after the top diplomats of South Korea and Japan held talks in Seoul earlier in the day, during which Tokyo agreed to take responsibility for the issue.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the deal, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologized to the Korean victims and Tokyo agreed to provide a 1 billion yen (US$8.3 million) in reparations to the victims through a fund to be created by the South Korean government. \u00a0\u00a0 In return, South Korea will refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue.\u00a0\u00a0 The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, said it cannot accept the deal as the Japanese government avoided legal responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0 \"In the agreement, Japanese government's responsibility is restricted in the boundary of ethics,\" the party's spokesman Kim Sung-soo said. \"Considering that the biggest issue was the Japanese government's acknowledgement of legal responsibility, (the result) is very disappointing.\" \u00a0\u00a0 \"We feel very sorry that the (South Korean) government vowed to end the dispute once and for all,\" Kim added. \u00a0\u00a0 The issue of former Korean sex slaves has long been a thorn in diplomatic ties between Seoul and Tokyo as Japan's conservative politicians are viewed as having not done enough to resolve the long-standing grievance regarding the Korean victims.\u00a0\u00a0 According to historians, more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony.

But others claimed that the agreement did not specify Japan's legal responsibility for the issue, leaving a seed of discord over an interpretation of the deal.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The deal seemed to come out as President Park Geun-hye and Abe made political decisions before this year, the 50th anniversary of normalization of the two countries' diplomatic ties, comes to an end,\" former South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan said.\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea has demanded Japan acknowledge state responsibility for the issue and offer proper compensation, while Tokyo insists the matter was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.\u00a0\u00a0 There are only 46 surviving South Korean victims, raising urgency for the issue to be resolved.\u00a0\u00a0 Abe, a conservative politician, had not apologized for Japan's sexual slavery since taking office in late 2012.

The ministry allocated a total of 532.2 billion won for all of its research and development projects, including research for cancer, chronic diseases and infectious diseases. Next year\u2019s budget for the specific cause is 7.6 billion won more than the budget this year.Among all projects, research for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and chronic diseases will receive 131.1 billion won. Research projects that aim to come up with new medical technologies and businesses will be given 172.3 billion won. For research projects for infectious diseases such as MERS, the ministry set aside 52.5 billion won. The government is also to invest 85.4 billion won in building research-focused hospitals.The Health Ministry and its affiliate the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have received much public criticism this year for their handling of a number of public health disasters, including the MERS outbreak, which had 186 confirmed cases and claimed 38 lives here.The outbreak dramatically affected everyday lives of Koreans and the economy, while the country\u2019s overall health care system and hospital culture were questioned. In October, a total of 55 graduate students at Konkuk University collectively developed pneumonia after working at three laboratories in the College of Animal Bioscience and Technology building. It was later revealed the infected students had been exposed to Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, a bacteria that causes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an inflammation of the alveoli within the lung triggered by inhaled dust.In September, it was revealed that some 120 infants were exposed to tuberculosis while staying at a postpartum center in Seoul from June 4 to Aug. 18, after one of the nurses had been diagnosed with the disease, but came to work regardless. To better handle infectious diseases in the future, the Health Ministry earlier this year announced that all general hospitals with 300 or more patient beds in Korea would be required to establish negative air pressure rooms to prevent cross-contamination. It also announced plans to hire epidemiologists, who will be the first responders to public health emergencies by investigating disease outbreaks and detecting new microbes.However, the ministry recently revealed that the number of medical professionals who applied for the positions fell short of the number of people needed. The ministry was planning on hiring seven professionals with at least six years of experience as certified physicians as epidemiologists, but less than seven doctors applied for the positions, the ministry said.Critics have pointed out that the particular positions should be regular full-time positions, instead of the current two-year contract posts. And without job security, not many medical professionals would be interested in the positions.Meanwhile, former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who was replaced by President Park Geun-hye for his inept handling of the MERS outbreak, has been controversially nominated to be the head of the state-run National Pension Service. Moon, a former economist whose expertise was in pension reform, has been openly against the main opposition party New Politics Alliance for Democracy\u2019s plan to increase the retirement income replacement rate to 50 percent from the previous 40 percent. Public Pension for All, a nongovernmental organization, held a rally in front of the National Pension Service building in Seoul, protesting against the Health Ministry\u2019s decision to nominate Moon as the head of the state-run agency on Monday.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles delving into the reality and the country\u2019s efforts to restrain the violence. This is the second installment. --Ed.It wasn\u2019t too hard for Yoon Eun-ji -- not her real name -- to find out that her senior colleague had been bullied by one of the executives of her company earlier this year. It wasn\u2019t difficult because the board member made it very clear that she was not happy with her pregnant colleague.\u201cThe executive humiliated her in front of everyone,\u201d said the 29-year-old, who works for a local conglomerate. \u201cShe yelled at the pregnant woman. One of the things the executive said was that there was no reason for her to \u2018suffer\u2019 because of the colleague.\u201dYoon later found out that the reason why the female executive, in her 50s, was upset was because she received a disciplinary measure from the human resources department for overworking the pregnant employee. Under Korea\u2019s labor laws, it is illegal for employers to make pregnant workers do night shifts.\u00a0Workplace bullying against women is often linked to pregnancies and maternity leaves in South Korea. (123RF)The pregnant worker, who had no choice but to stay late in the office to finish her assigned tasks -- the company does not allow employees to take their work home for security reasons -- never reported her boss to the authorities. The human resources team found out through the company\u2019s time-tracking system, which automatically calculates each worker\u2019s time spent at work as they clock in and out.\u201cMy senior colleague ended up taking her maternity leave earlier than scheduled, mostly because of the stress (due to her relationship with the executive),\u201d Yoon said. Alarming statistics The case of Yoon\u2019s colleague reflects South Korea\u2019s workplace harassment that is getting more rampant, complex and cruel. According to a report submitted to the National Assembly by the Korea Women\u2019s Development Institute earlier this year, 16.5 percent of 4,589 surveyed Korean workers said they have been harassed at the workplace at least once in their lives. The state-run think tank claimed that the rate is about 1.5 times higher than the world\u2019s average proportion of victims, which is about 10 percent.Some of the most high-profile workplace harassment cases in Korea include the \u201cnut rage\u201d incident, in which the former Korean Air vice president Cho Hyun-ah ordered a departing jet from New York to Seoul to return to the terminal gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport, after being dissatisfied with the way a flight attendant served her nuts on the plane last year. \u201cThere are many factors behind Korea\u2019s workplace bullying situation,\u201d said Lee Myung-sun, head of the KWDI, in her open letter to the Assembly, stressing that women and contract workers are some of the most vulnerable to the violence.\u201cThe (Korean) work culture that emphasizes competition and productivity, the increasing number of temporary and contract workers with limited job security, as well as the nation\u2019s long work hours and hierarchal work relationships together contribute to this problem.\u201dAmong the surveyed Koreans who said they had been harassed at work, 58.4 percent said they were purposely given too much work, while 48.5 percent said they were constantly monitored by their employer to a degree where they felt an invasion of their privacy. Also, 44.1 percent said they have been purposely given work that was too easy as an insult, while 43.2 percent said they had been assigned to do a task that was either beyond their capabilities or control. Forty-one percent also said they had been either verbally insulted or humiliated at work. Meanwhile, 68.5 percent of the harassed participants said they were attacked by their bosses, while 32 percent said they had been harassed by their clients. Also, 31 percent said they were bullied by the executives of their companies.Other research reports have shown that the situation may be more serious. In a survey by the Korean Finance and Service Workers\u2019 Union of its 3,065 members in June, 48.8 percent said they had been bullied at work. A 2012 survey by Saramin, an online recruitment website, showed 45 percent of the 2,975 working Koreans who participated had a coworker who was bullied. Among them, 61.3 percent said the bullying problem was very serious, and 58.3 percent said they saw a colleague quit after being bullied.Rep. Lee Jasmine of the ruling Saenuri Party said not many Koreans are aware that workplace harassment is a systemic problem. \u201cThe \u2018nut rage\u2019 incident has brought the issue of workplace harassment into the limelight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut many Koreans still consider it as personal conflicts with people at work, rather than as potential illegal activities or a systemic problem.\u201dGender and job security A number of studies have shown that women, young employees and contract workers are more vulnerable to workplace harassment than those with full-time positions and male employees in Korea.A report by KWDI released last week, which surveyed 1,000 female workers in the nation\u2019s service sector, showed that 45.9 percent of those working under a contract have experienced workplace harassment. Meanwhile, 29.2 percent of the workers who work full-time have endured the same. The report also showed that the younger workers were more vulnerable to workplace abuse. Among the surveyed, 46.3 percent of those in their 20s said they had been harassed at work, compared to 30.3 percent of those in their 40s and 36.5 percent of those in their 30s.In a 2014 study by Seo Yoo-jeong from the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, 85.7 percent of the victims who participated in her research said their perpetrators were men, while only 9.6 percent of them said they were attacked by women at work. According to a 2011 research by local law firm Korean Public Interest Lawyers\u2019 Group, which surveyed 1,633 women employees, 60.6 percent said they had been sexually harassed at work at least once in their lives. Last year, four full-time workers at Seoul Grand Park, a park complex run by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, received disciplinary action after it was revealed that they had been sexually and verbally harassing a female contract worker who was hoping to get a full-time offer at the time.The victim was junior to the four perpetrators -- three male and one female. Among the abuse she experienced included being forced to attend drinking gatherings and enduring unwanted touching and sexually explicit jokes. The victim, when reporting to the city government\u2019s human rights office, said she did not resist in part as she was desperate to get a full-time position.The KWDI report also mentioned a sexual harassment case at Renault Samsung Motors, where a female employee was sexually harassed by her male superior for over a year starting in 2012. The report claimed that the victim and those who supported her faced additional harassment at work after her boss received a disciplinary measure from the company following her report to the authorities. According to the report, the human resources department spread false rumors about the victim, claiming she purposely seduced the perpetrator, a married man, first, and that sexual harassment in fact never happened, but she fabricated the facts to falsely report him. The victim, whose work performance had been stellar prior to the case, received poor grades in her work evaluation after she reported her boss. She was also abruptly told not to pursue the projects that had been originally given to her prior to the case, and instead assigned to do errands such as purchasing office items. One of her coworkers, who openly supported her when the victim reported the perpetrator, was also demoted allegedly for no specific reason and received very poor work evaluation.Workplace bullying against women is also often linked to pregnancies and maternity leaves. Last year, the Korean Health and Medical Workers\u2019 Union revealed that among its 1,902 female members -- all nurses -- who are or have been pregnant, 17.4 percent have been encouraged by the employers to avoid pregnancy or get pregnant at a certain time so their maternity leaves do not coincide with their co-workers'.\u00a0Also, 21.9 percent said they had to endure night shifts while pregnant, although the law prohibits it, and 18.7 percent experienced either miscarriages or stillbirths because of work-related stress and long work hours.\u00a0\u00a0According to a 2011 research by a local law firm, which surveyed 1,633 women employees, 60.6 percent said they had been sexually harassed at work at least once in their lives. (123RF)In 2012, a former bank employee won a suit filed against her employer and coworkers, who bullied her after returning from a year of maternity leave. The banker, who had been in charge of accounts and mostly worked as a teller before taking the break, was asked to be an usher instead when she returned. Her desk was gone, and as an usher she had to stand the whole time. When she confronted her boss, he told her: \u201cI no longer consider you as my employee. If you feel this is unfair, you should take the case to Cheong Wa Dae.\u201d The KWDI report showed that her boss told all of the employees to \u201ccooperate\u201d in isolating her in the office, so she would eventually give up and quit. The victim suffered depression because of the experience.Labor issueIn October, representatives from labor, management and government reached an agreement that permitted employers to fire underperforming workers in exchange for hiring more full-time workers. Meanwhile, a number of bills to tackle workplace bullying have been proposed since 2013, but are currently pending at the Assembly.Lawyer Lee Jong-hee from the Korean Public Interest Lawyers\u2019 Group, who also filed a report on the situation of workplace bullying to the Assembly, said limited job security resulting from being more vulnerable to getting fired may create more abuse cases at workplaces. \u201cWhen you are on the verge of losing your job, you can\u2019t report your boss for abuse,\u201d the lawyer said in the report. \u201cResearch has shown that women workers are more unstable in the labor market and the change may make them even more vulnerable to workplace bullying than before.\u201dAmong the 360,000 who joined the temporary workforce in Korea over the past decade, 89 percent were women, according to the KWDI. Also, female temporary workers earned only 36 percent of full-time male workers\u2019 average salary last year.\u201c(Korean) women are constantly exposed to sexist behavior when they are in the workforce,\u201d Koo Mi-young from the KWDI. \u201cFor example, married women are still often expected to do housework even they are working, while their husbands are simply expected to \u2018help out\u2019 when they can, rather than fully share the responsibilities. Such experiences can make women unaware of the problems, and make them incapable to recognize even when they are harassed by someone else.\u201dLawyer Lee said the laws should try to protect every worker\u2019s dignity. \u201cWe need to talk about the system that makes it almost impossible for many workers to live with dignity,\u201d the lawyer said in the report. \u201cWe need to talk about the system in order to tackle this issue (of workplace harassment).\u201d Last month, Rep. Lee In-young from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a bill that newly defines workplace harassment and therefore make them punishable by the laws. It includes spreading malicious rumors and gossip that is not true; removing areas of responsibilities without reason for more than six months; insulting or criticizing a person persistently or constantly; assigning unreasonable or useless duties which are unfavorable to the person; and excluding or isolating someone socially at workplace. The bill also stipulated that in all lawsuits that involve workplace bullying, the accused must prove their innocence while the plaintiff does not have to prove the damages they suffered.However, along with a number of other bills tackling the issue, Rep. Lee\u2019s proposal is currently pending at the National Assembly.According to a report by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training released in June, a single workplace bullying case can cost a company up to 15.5 million won ($13,300), as it negatively affects the workers\u2019 productivity and mental health.A number of countries, including Finland, Belgium and Canada, have legislations about workplace violence and harassment. In France, the Supreme Court held that it is an employer\u2019s obligation to prevent workplace bullying and therefore renders them liable for bullying committed by their employees.

Help SyriaThe civil war that erupted against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in March, 2011, as part of Arab Spring, has killed over 250,000 people and created some 4.4 million refugees and 9 million internally displaced persons. Fleeing government forces and the Islamic State, they have entered neighboring Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq in droves. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, registered Syrian refugees have so far reached 2.3 million in Turkey, 1.07 million in Lebanon, 633,000 in Jordan, 245,000 in Iraq and 124,000 in Egypt. More than 1 million Syrians live in Turkey\u2019s refugee camps, receiving food, shelter, education and health care, while the rest live in cities and towns, where jobs are scanty, Almohammad Agha told The Korea Herald last week. \u201cThe situation in Lebanon was the most difficult due to the unstable political climate, with risks of kidnapping, sexual assault and death,\u201d he said. \u201cAs there is no refugee camp, they live in poverty on the streets or private properties in a pack of 50 to 60 tents.\u201dJordan is a bit safer, according to the director, with some 130,000 living in camps and the remainder scattered across the country.

In 2013, the Korean government enacted the Refugee Act to accept more international asylum seekers following the UNHCR recommendations. Given the government\u2019s plan to take in roughly 30 refugees a year, critics have argued for an increase, noting that the \u201cglobal standard\u201d was nine times that of Korea. So far, some 9,150 people have applied for asylum in Korea and 330 were granted refugee status; nearly 850 Syrians have sought asylum in Korea and 3 were granted it.

The regulation covers the narrative of product slogans, company names and catchphrases spoken or written in foreign languages. When foreign languages are used, Korean subtitles should be added to offer enough information for local viewers, the agency said. The current broadcasting law states that TV commercials must use a standard language, abide by rules for Korean spelling system and loanword adaptation. It also prohibits unnecessary use of foreign languages. But there has been no specific clause stipulating the time limit for foreign languages in TV ads. \u201cTo reflect the growing use of foreign languages in TV commercials and better enforce the law, we specifically set the time limit for foreign language use in TV ads,\u201d the agency said. In February, French cosmetic brand Christian Dior and Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo were cautioned for using all-English narrative of their products -- perfume J\u2019adore and clothes Heattech, respectively -- in their ads that aired on cable-TV channels last year. The KCSC offered recommendations to the companies, addressing the public role of language used on TV. \u201cThe society has become more accepting of English and the use of foreign languages reflects the changing social atmosphere. But those who are not familiar with English or having difficulties in reading Korean subtitles can possibly be excluded. And a flood of foreign language use can have an impact on teenagers,\u201d the agency said in its deliberation.According to reports from the National Institute of Korean Language obtained by Jung Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party, a total of 6,815 TV commercials and programs breached the \u201ccorrect\u201d language use rule on TV last year. Of them, 31.9 percent were caught after using unnecessary foreign languages, followed by 25. 7 percent having errors in subtitles, 10.9 percent using online words and 10.1 percent using defamatory language. But the guidelines will likely rekindle a long-held debate over the state\u2019s restrictions on commercial freedom of expression. The controversy dates back to 2002 when the then-industry ministry suggested that the media agency allow advertisers to use foreign languages and songs in TV ads to help companies better promote their brands amid globalization. The advertisers\u2019 association campaigned to scrap restrictions on foreign language uses in TV commercials, saying that such a ban stifles freedom of expression and creativity. It also added that the ban discourages multinational companies from promoting their image, fails to live up to global standards and fails to\u00a0meet consumers\u2019 diversifying tastes.The claims, however, triggered resistance from the Culture Ministry and Korean language advocate groups which voiced concerns over its adverse impact on Korean language and culture.\u00a0 In a report by the Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corporation published in 2003, the state-run agency claimed that foreign language in TV ads could undermine the development of Korean language, enhance Korean\u2019s perception that foreign languages are more elegant and accelerate westernization of Korean culture, the report said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","19":"TOKYO (AFP) - A Japanese court on Friday ordered camera maker Nikon to pay damages to a South Korean photographer whose Tokyo exhibition on Japanese wartime sex slaves was temporarily cancelled, the company said.The Tokyo District Court ordered Nikon to pay 1.1 million yen ($9,100) to Japan-based cameraman Ahn Sehong, a company spokesman told AFP.Ahn filed a lawsuit in 2012, demanding compensation of 14 million yen, after Nikon abruptly cancelled his event scheduled to be held at Nikon Salon in Tokyo, a site where people can hold individual exhibitions. The exhibit featured 37 photos of some of the now-elderly Korean women forced to serve as 'comfort women' -- a euphemism for women forced into prostitution -- for Japan's military during World War II.Nikon, which had initially approved Ahn's proposal for the exhibition, unexpectedly cancelled the show three days after a newspaper article about it led to public complaints. The Tokyo District Court at the time, however, ordered Nikon to allow the exhibit to go on.\"I'm happy that freedom of expression has been acknowledged,\" Ahn told reporters after the court ruling, according to Sankei Shimbun newspaper.Nikon had justified its decision to close down the show out of safety concerns, and the spokesman said the company felt the court's decision partially reflected an acknowledgement of its position.\"We'll carefully consider whether to appeal or not,\" he said. The wartime forced sex issue is a sensitive and divisive one in Japan, which colonised the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945, while its military invaded parts of China and other areas of Asia during World War II.Many Japanese agree that young women from the Korean peninsula and elsewhere in Asia were systematically and repeatedly forced into having sex with Japanese soldiers during the war.But some argue that local pimps and businesses tricked the women into prostitution rings, with Japanese soldiers buying their services as customers with the military having no direct role in the running of brothels.The issue has been a major irritant between Seoul and Tokyo, with South Korea repeatedly asking for talks on compensation. Japan has consistently cited a broad 1965 compensation deal with Seoul that led to the normalisation of diplomatic relations as having settled all outstanding issues.But Friday's court decision came as Japan and South Korea announced that their foreign ministers will meet next week in a bid to reach a final settlement over the issue.","20":"President Park Geun-hye checked military readiness against possible North Korean provocations as she made a rare visit to a military base near the border with North Korea, an official said Thursday.Park, wearing a military jacket, commended the soldiers at the military division in Yeoncheon near the central section of the border, for their \"resolute\" response to North Korea's shelling attacks on Aug. 20, presidential spokesman Jeong Yeon-guk said.Combined with a land-mine attack earlier in the month, the August shelling escalated military tensions between the two Koreas before they agreed to mend ties in a landmark Aug. 25 agreement.\"I want the military to have confidence and maintain watertight combat readiness against North Korea's provocations,\" Park was quoted as saying.\"I will always rely on the military's judgment on and response to North Korean provocations or any other emergency situations.\"South Korea always keeps the door open for talks with North Korea, she said, adding that \"however, progress in the inter-Korean ties could come only when we have a firm position in readiness and a principled stance.This visit marked the second time that Park has visited a military base near the border since she took office in 2013.The latest visit came amid lingering concerns over North Korea's possible provocations against South Korea.\u00a0On Tuesday, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lee Sun-jin instructed frontline commanders to maintain tight combat readiness, citing the possibility of North Korea's unexpected military provocations.\u00a0North Korea's state news agency reported earlier in the day that leader Kim Jong-un ordered his troops to intensify combat drills as he inspected joint military drills.\"Practical drills should be conducted so often to cope with the hardest and severest war,\" Kim was quoted by the Korean Central News Agency.

Yonhap\u201cWe are not going to tolerate them shifting their responsibility on the central government by using innocent parents as their hostage.\u201dAmong the 17 education offices nationwide, only 10 of them have set aside a budget for the \u201cNuri\u201d subsidy program, which gives allowance that fully covers kindergarten and day care tuition fees for all children aged 3-5, albeit only for the first two months of 2016. Among the remaining seven, Sejong City and Gangwon and North Jeolla provinces have partially funded the programs by allocating their budget for children who will be attending kindergartens, but not those at day care centers. Four municipal education offices -- Seoul, Gwangju, and Gyeonggi and South Jeolla provinces -- have not set aside a budget for the program, meaning parents who live in those regions must start paying for their children\u2019s kindergarten or day care costs starting January. According to the regional education offices, the Nuri program requires some 2.1 trillion won ($1.9 billion) to implement nationwide next year. The central government recently allocated 300 billion won to support the municipal offices to finance the program, but the education superintendents have stressed that they are still 1.8 trillion won short of making the allowance program possible for 2016.Just a day before the press conference, a group of education superintendents, including the Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon, gathered to express their frustration, publicly requesting President Park Geun-hye to meet with them in person to discuss the matter. Jang Huy-gook, superintendent of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education, who also represents all education chiefs nationwide, argued that day care centers are child care institutions, not educational institutions, and therefore regional education offices are only responsible for supporting kindergarten costs.\u201cWe have repeatedly told the central government that we are at least willing to finance the budget that is required for children who will be sent to kindergarten,\u201d said Jang on Wednesday at the gathering in Seoul. \u201cBut day care centers are being regulated by the Ministry of Welfare, not the Ministry of Education. We believe that day care centers are child care institutions, not educational institutions. Therefore we think it\u2019s reasonable for the central government, precisely the Welfare Ministry, to finance the Nuri allowance for parents who send their kids to day care centers, while we finance the program for those who send their children to kindergarten. It\u2019s absurd for the central government to ask us to finance 1.8 trillion won while they\u2019ve only given us 300 billion won.\u201dThe Education Ministry is not the only central government agency who is preparing a legal battle against municipal agencies. The Welfare Ministry also announced Wednesday that it would file a lawsuit against the governments of Seoul and Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, claiming the regional governments went against the law by setting aside a budget for special allowance program -- a monthly subsidy of 500,000 won -- for young unemployed Koreans without \u201cconsulting\u201d the central government.Along with the Education Ministry, the Welfare Ministry also created controversy over its own child care subsidy program for infants aged 0-2 earlier this year. In September, it announced that it will charge households with full-time stay-at-home mothers for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily starting July next year. The revision, which the ministry claimed was \u201cto better support double-income households,\u201d was criticized by critics who called it misogynistic and discriminatory.

According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, police and prosecutors arrested a Nigerian and detained him for 12 days, ignoring his multiple requests to contact the Nigerian Embassy. Police arrested the man, who was at the time on the wanted list, on a theft charge in November last year. He denied the charge and asked police officers to contact the Nigerian Embassy, but they allegedly refused his request. Police and prosecutors reportedly shifted responsibility onto each other, with police saying they were only in charge of the initial investigation and prosecutors saying the police should have contacted the embassy.\u201cThe man\u2019s rights to self-defense was violated as police and prosecutors refused his request to contact his embassy when arresting and detaining him,\u201d said an official from the watchdog.According to the Constitution, the families of those arrested and detained have a right to know the date, place and reason for arrest and detention.When foreign nationals face arrest and detention, police and prosecutors are required to allow suspects to freely contact their embassies in Korea for their self-defense. The law enforcement agencies should notify the embassies of suspects\u2019 status, too. The NHRCK said it had imposed a recommendation for prosecutors and advised police to offer proper job training for officers to cope with such a situation. The man was eventually set free after he was found not guilty and falsely accused, as a fellow Nigerian national had given the man\u2019s name and foreign registration number to avoid arrest when he had been caught stealing items. \u201cThe Nigerian was framed, but the arrest and detention were carried out in accordance with the law, so there is no problem in the law enforcement,\u201d the NHRCK official said.

South Korea could bring about the Aug. 25 agreement after North Korea's landmine and shelling provocations in early August thanks to the military's resolute military reactions to the provocations, he highlighted. The landmine attacks maimed two South Korean soldiers in early August, sharply escalating military tensions between the two Koreas, which were resolved in a marathon negotiation later in the month.

Five business lobbying groups, including the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said a bipartisan deal is urgent to draw up business plans and adopt reform measures in workplaces.In September, labor, management and the government reached a landmark deal to ease labor restrictions to allow companies to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming.However, no follow-up measures have been taken as related bills were pending in the parliament. \"Without labor reforms, it is hard to create jobs for youth and achieve sustainable economic growth.

In late May, 22 U.S. servicemen were found to have possibly come into contact with the lethal bacteria sent to Osan Air Base in Gyeonggi Province from a military laboratory in Utah. Though the USFK said that none of them had shown signs of infection and the substances were destroyed immediately, the incident fueled vehement protests by civic groups over what they called porous customs clearance, and prompted the allies to launch a working group for a fact-finding probe in July. Announcing the results, the panel said the USFK had brought in and tested dead anthrax samples 15 times at Yongsan Garrison in central Seoul between 2009 and 2014. That adds to the May exercise for which it mailed 1 milliliter of inactive Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague) samples alongside the same amount of possibly live anthrax bacilli. \u201cWe confirmed that USFK imported inactivated Bacillus anthracis test samples as well as inactivated Yersinia pestis samples for detection and identification training ... while safely decontaminating the facility and destroying the samples,\u201d said Maj.

On May 29, the USFK issued a statement in Korean saying the incident took place during a \u201cfirst-ever exercise aimed at ramping up its capabilities to protect the allied forces and South Koreans,\u201d though its English version simply stated that the training followed \u201croutine laboratory protocols and normal handling procedures.\u201d After Seoul officials demanded an explanation, USFK personnel replied that it meant it was the first they had conducted an anthrax test at the Osan base, not Yongsan. Better known as the JUPITR program, Joint U.S. Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition came as part of Washington\u2019s strategy to advance biosurveillance capabilities on the peninsula while rebalancing military assets in the Asia-Pacific region.During the meeting, the sides assessed that North Korea may possess 13 types of biological agents, including anthrax and plague, raising the possibility for their use \u201cfor the purpose of terror or an all-out-war.\u201d \u201c(The allies) shared the common belief that biological defense cooperation is absolutely needed to protect the life and safety of our citizens from increasing North Korean biological threats as well as worldwide biological terrorism,\u201d they said in a joint statement, vowing to carry on with combined exercises and step up cooperation in biological defense.

Ahn Cheonl-soo, who had left the party over a power struggle with the current party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. They were the first to follow behind Ahn in leaving the party after several other dissenters retracted their initial decisions to defect and decided to stay for the sake of an opposition victory in next year\u2019s general elections. Reps. Moon Byung-ho, Yoo Sung-yop, and Hwang Ju-hong -- who had warned of their defection since Ahn left the NPAD on Dec. 13 -- vowed to create a new opposition bloc with other dissenters who had already left the NPAD or are planning to quit the party. \u201cWe are leaving the NPAD to walk the path of victory and reunite the opposition bloc,\u201d Moon said in a news conference at the National Assembly. \u201cWe will gather forces from the people who agree with us and create a new political group to realign the opposition bloc,\u201d said Moon. But the prospects of their plan to rival the established parties remained to be seen as the majority of the NPAD dissenters, who have echoed the defectors\u2019 criticism against the current NPAD leadership, were seen to be reluctant to follow their lead.\u00a0Representatives Hwang Ju-hong (center), Moon Byung-ho (left) and Yoo Sung-yop talk to reporters after a press conference announcing their NPAD defection at the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapExcept for Rep. Kim Dong-cheol, who is reportedly considering leaving the party, there have been no other NPAD lawmakers inside or outside the mainstream suggesting they would quit the party in the foreseeable future. Even Rep. Song Ho-chang, who had worked for Ahn\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012, has decided to stay. As an opinion poll released by local pollster Realmeter showed Wednesday that the NPAD\u2019s approval ratings were almost double that of Ahn\u2019s prospective party, some dissenters cautioned that more defections would lead to a division of the opposition -- a scenario that has led to election defeats in the past. \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s political structure is based on two major political parties whose support comes from regional divisions,\u201d said Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, another NPAD dissenter who decided to remain at the party. \u201cThird parties have always raised hopes for a new kind of politics, but they often gave up midway,\u201d said Kim.\u00a0 For example, the divided opposition bloc suffered a crushing defeat in the 1996 general election as then-main opposition Democratic Party split into two opposition groups -- National Congress for New Politics and Unified Democratic Party. Mindful of the scenario, the three defectors have yet to outline their next move -- whether they will join forces with Ahn or other NPAD defectors, such as Rep. Chung Jung-bae, who has recently created his own minor party, or Rep. Park Joo-sun, who on Thursday stressed the imperativeness of the dissenters forming a single opposition bloc. Meanwhile, NPAD third-term lawmaker Rep. Choi Jae-sung announced Thursday that he would not run in the election. The move was considered to be in support of chairman Moon\u2019s reform initiatives that he vowed to uphold in Wednesday\u2019s press conference to keep the house in order.Moon has said he would adopt a bottom-up approach for nominating candidates for the 2016 general elections amid calls for the established NPAD members to forgo their run to make way for fresh faces. Moon had warned that NPAD lawmakers categorized in the bottom 20 percent in their job performance reviews would be deprived of the opportunity to stand for reelection. Among the dissenting lawmakers, Hwang and Yoo refused to undergo the review.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","34":"A three-day hearing on matters related to last year\u2019s ferry sinking wrapped up Wednesday with the fact-finding committee stressing a lack of sufficient rescue efforts, men in charge dodging responsibility and suspicions left unanswered.The hearing focused mainly on the rescue efforts taken by the now-defunct Korea Coast Guard, Maritime Ministry and other related government officials in the face of Sewol\u2019s sinking, which left 304 dead or missing in April 2014. The five committee members recommended by the ruling Saenuri Party boycotted the hearing.\u00a0 Witnesses attend a hearing on the April 16 Sewol ferry sinking at YWCA in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The Sewol Special Investigation Committee raised questions as to whether or not the pressure to report every detail of the case to higher authorities had hindered rescue operations. They pointed out that Kim Kyung-il, former captain of the Mokpo Coast Guard patrol boat 123, sentenced to three years in prison for inadequate rescue operations, had about two dozen phone conversations with the Coast Guard even after he was appointed to lead the operations.\u201cI cannot agree. It did not affect the operation,\u201d said former Coast Guard Commissioner General Kim Suk-kyoon, during the second day of the hearing. He also denied allegations that the authorities exaggerated the number of divers in rescue operations, saying that \u201cdeploy\u201d does not necessarily mean that all divers had dived.Kim also refrained from divulging many details, such as whether the rescuers told the 467 passengers to exit the vessel, saying he could not remember. During the tragedy, the ship captain and the crew instructed the passengers \u2015 most of whom were high school students \u2015 to stay in the vessel, stopping them from getting out in time.Families of Sewol victims said Wednesday that the rescue operations were \u201cgreatly inflated.\u201d Jung Sung-wook, father of 17-year-old Dong-soo who was killed in the incident, claimed that no rescue operation at all was conducted on April 17, the day after Sewol plunged below the surface. Cho Hyeong-gon, then-emergency director of the Mokpo Coast Guard, ducked responsibility, saying that the people \u201cat the scene\u201d should have made the judgement, and not the people who were \u201c120 kilometers away.\u201d \u201cWe received instructions, but most of our actions were based on the manual,\u201d he said.Kim Kyung-il said that he \u201cdid not even think about\u201d ordering people to abandon ship. When asked if he should have done so after learning about the situation from the Sewol captain and the crew \u2015 who were among the first recued \u2015 he said, \u201cNow that I think about it, yes. I panicked at the time.\u201dHe remains the only rescuer to receive criminal punishment related to Sewol incident. The committee also held the Maritime Ministry liable for writing imprecise reports about the rescue operation that triggered faulty initial news reports saying all passengers had been rescued.Former Maritime Minister Lee Joo-young claimed that media reports were not based on the official statements of the ministry, but said the ministry was \u201cultimately responsible for the incident.\u201d The hearing also touched on suspicion that the Coast Guard officials fabricated the transcript of its instructions to dodge responsibility. Lee Choo-jae, who headed the rescue team at the Korea Coast Guard at the time, said that transcripts had been \u201cupgraded\u201d several times to add parts that were neglected before.A gaffe from one of the Coast Guard officials made Monday sparked the anger of bereaved families.Park Sang-wook, formerly of the Coast Guard, said the students failed to recognize the danger because \u201cthey didn\u2019t know better.\u201d With the officials denying responsibility, Kim Dong-su \u2015 a Sewol survivor credited with saving 20 fellow passengers \u2015 shouted \u201ctell the truth\u201d as he intentionally injured himself. He and his wife, who fainted at the sight, were carried off to the hospital.\u00a0By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","35":"The National Assembly\u2019s speaker Wednesday rejected Cheong Wa Dae\u2019s demand to call a vote for contentious pending bills that President Park Geun-hye has been urging the legislative body to push through as soon as possible. However, Speaker Chung Ui-hwa reiterated that he would use his authority to call a vote on a bill that would determine new rules for next year\u2019s general election unless the rival parties\u2019 lawmakers reached an agreement by the end of this year. His remark came as President Park and the ruling Saenuri Party ratcheted up pressure on the speaker to bypass the deadlocked parliamentary committees and put to a plenary vote the overdue bills that aim to relax regulations on businesses and reform the labor market. It was considered a setback to the presidential office\u2019s accelerating attempts to pressure the Assembly into legislating Park\u2019s economic policies, a move that Chung and main opposition party said would violate the democratic rule of separation of power. \u201c(If I propose the bill myself), it would be an act of constitutional violation. (My proposal) would bring more chaos to the nation and more harm to our economy,\u201d the former Saenuri Party lawmaker said. By custom, the speaker leaves his or her party when assuming the position. President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday denounced the Assembly for \u201cfailing to do its job,\u201d highlighting that the pending bills are crucial to revitalize oversupplied industries and create jobs for young people. Her remark was widely seen as a pressure on Chung to greenlight the bills. But the fifth term lawmaker refused to cite the economic situation as a reason for him to exercise his authority, disputing the argument that the nation\u2019s economy is bad enough to constitute an \u201cemergency situation\u201d where the speaker could independently put the bills to a vote in a plenary session.According to Clause 85 of the Assembly\u2019s law, the speaker can bring bills to the floor without undergoing the committee\u2019s review when the nation faces natural disaster or contingencies like wars, or when the Assembly\u2019s political parties with more than 20 parliamentary seats agree to do so.\u00a0 Rep. Chung Ui-hwa. YonhapThe main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chimed in. NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in blasted President Park for compromising democratic rule by intervening in the legislative body\u2019s affair. \u201cKorea democracy is hurting. The president is ignoring the opposition parties and treating the speaker and the ruling party\u2019s leader as if they are her subordinates. I think what the Park administration is doing is nothing but another version of dictatorship,\u201d said Moon.\u00a0 Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, an independent who left the NPAD over a power struggle with Moon, echoed the criticism. He said on Twitter that the president is blaming the Assembly for her administration\u2019s own failure and putting undue pressure on the head of the National Assembly. While Cheong Wa Dae did not directly comment on Chung\u2019s refusal, it repeated that it was up to the speaker to move things along at the Assembly.Presidential secretary Hyun Ki-hwan had visited Chung\u2019s office on Tuesday to urge him to exercise his power, and later criticized the lack of progress by saying the Assembly was \u201conly looking out for the lawmakers\u2019 interests.\u201d Chung denounced Hynun\u2019s remark as \u201ccrude and absurd.\u201d Saenuri Party members visited Chung\u2019s office after his remark on Wednesday and urged Chung to accept the presidential office\u2019s demand to propose the pending bills. The speaker reportedly refused once again, and the atmosphere grew tense as he yelled at the visiting lawmakers, according to insiders.Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters the same day that he is thinking of suggesting Park to exercise her presidential power to order an emergency legislation of economy-related bills without waiting for the Assembly endorsement. The authority was last used by late President Kim Young-sam in 1993 when he adopted policies to achieve transparency in financial transactions. Meanwhile, the speaker reiterated that he would put to a vote the bill that aims to redraw electoral maps for the 2016 general election. Although prospective candidates began to register for the ballot Tuesday, the lawmakers have remained deadlocked over the rezoning scheme, meaning the candidates don\u2019t yet know what their potential constituency will be. \u201cThe right to vote is the most important fundamental right. We will face serious consequences unless we resolve the issue by the end of this year. I have to make a judgement call before parliamentary contingencies occur,\u201d said Chung. His remark came a day after the rival parties\u2019 leadership failed to reach an agreement on the rules that determine the number of seats for lawmakers elected via vote by local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation.The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same.\u00a0By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","36":"President Park Geun-hye called for an economic contingency plan Wednesday to brace for a possible crisis, citing potential instability in emerging countries.\u00a0\u00a0She also said South Korea's economy could face uncertainty if a potential Fed rate hike increases fluctuations in international financial markets.\u00a0\u00a0\"We should put our economy back on track to ensure people can feel economic recovery next year,\" Park said in a meeting with officials about next year's economic policy.

According to Uijeongbu District Prosecutors\u2019 Office, 74 professors have been indicted in relation to the case while other 105 have been summarily indicted. They have been charged with copyright infringement and disrupting public duty. Out of the 105 who have been summarily charged, the professors who stole their peers\u2019 work have each been fined 10 million won ($8,440), while the original authors face a 3 million-won fine.The officials have also indicted five publishing company employees on suspicion of taking part in the scheme.This is the first time that the authorities have staged a mass crackdown on the widespread \u201ccover-swapping\u201d sham, whereby scholars disguise an already-published book by another scholar as their own. The original author condones the process in order to maintain an amicable relationship with the publishers for future book deals, who in turn get to sell their inventory as new books.As local universities have policies against rehiring faculty members who have been fined 3 million won or more, it is likely that they will be banned from returning to their teaching posts.Prosecutors have notified the list of the indicted professors to their respective universities, and plan to expand the investigation by launching a special team dealing specifically with illegal activities related to research and studies.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","39":"South Korea and China will hold talks next week aimed at resolving the issue of their overlapping exclusive economic zones, Seoul's Foreign Ministry said Monday.\u00a0\u00a0The talks, led by Second Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin, will be held in Seoul next Tuesday, the ministry said in a release.\u00a0\u00a0In July 2014, President Park Geun-hye and her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to launch negotiations this year on the demarcation of their maritime boundaries amid tension over their overlapping EEZs.\u00a0\u00a0Ieodo, a submerged reef controlled by Seoul, lies 149 kilometers southwest of Korea's southernmost island of Marado and 247 kilometers northeast of the nearest Chinese island Tongdao.

Election officials said candidates cannot register for the parliamentary elections unless the electoral districts are redrawn by Tuesday. The rival parties are required to redraw electoral districts as the Constitutional Court ruled last year that the current electoral map was unconstitutional, citing unequal representation.The court said that the population differences between electoral districts should be reduced to two-to-one, noting the most populous electoral districts outweigh the least populous three seats to one.The rival parties are at odds over the number of elected parliamentary seats in rural areas and proportional representation.The Saenuri Party has proposed maintaining the 300-seat National Assembly by increasing the number of constituencies while reducing the number of lawmakers elected on proportional tickets, which currently stands at 54.The NPAD has opposed the plan, saying it will bring out more regionalism in local politics and wants to maintain the number of seats given to proportional representation members.\"Contentious bills will be discussed (by lawmakers) at parliamentary committees,\" Lee Jong-kul, floor leader of the NPAD, told Yonhap News Agency.The 100-day regular session wrapped up Tuesday without the endorsement of the set of bills designed to revitalize the country's economy, after the rival parties failed to narrow their differences.

The more important issue is the possibility of catastrophe in North Korea, catastrophe in the sense that there could be extreme forms of violence.\"The committee is working under the assumption of unification is going to be peaceful, he said.For Koreans, unification is \"not a rational choice\" but a \"national aspiration and, in a way, national destination,\" Chung stressed.\"One thing that this government and President Park Geun-hye has done is to restore this national aspiration for unification which ... has been diminishing,\" he said.Park has made strong pitches for unification since early last year, saying it would be a \"bonanza\" for the two Koreas as well as a blessing for neighboring countries. North Korea has denounced the drive as an attempt to absorb it. (Yonhap)","49":"The White House said Thursday it doubts North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's claims that the communist nation has developed hydrogen bombs.\"We certainly are concerned about the policies and intent and destabilizing actions of the North Korean regime. At this point, you know, the information that we have access to calls into serious question those claims,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a regular briefing of the North's H-bomb claims.\"But we take very seriously the risks and the threat that is posed by the North Korean regime and their ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon that doesn't just threaten our close allies in South Korea, but could have a pretty destabilizing impact and even a national security threat to other countries in the region,\" he said.According to Pyongyang's state media, the North's leader said the country has become a \"powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation.\"It was believed to be the first time that Kim has publicly mentioned the North's development of an H-bomb, which uses more advanced technology and is considered much more powerful than conventional nuclear weapons based either on weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium.The State Department urged the North to completely give up all of its nuclear weapons and programs.\"We continue to call on North Korea to comply with its international commitments and obligations. North Korea must abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and cease all related activities immediately,\" State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams told Yonhap News Agency.\"The international community stands united in its firm opposition to North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. North Korea will not achieve the prosperity and security it seeks and will remain isolated until it abandons its illicit weapons programs and abides by its international obligations and commitments,\" she said.South Korea's intelligence community was skeptical about the North's H-bomb capability, with an intelligence official saying that the North is not believed to have such capabilities when it has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads.In Beijing, China said it is aware of the North's H-bomb claim, and called for all relevant countries to make greater efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, lower tensions and maintain peace and stability.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments. (Yonhap)","50":"President Park Geun-hye on Thursday called for efforts to tackle South Korea\u2019s low birthrate, which she said was linked to the inflexible labor market that underscores the need for labor reform measures that have been left pending at the National Assembly.The low birthrate, according to the president, is due to the lack of jobs, and the consequential delay in marriage, and the fundamental solution is to reform the current labor structure.\u201cThe government is currently pushing strongly ahead with labor reforms to revitalize the economy and solve youth unemployment,\u201d she said during the meeting of a committee to solve issues relating low fertility and an aging society. President Park Geun-hye speaks Thursday at a committee meeting on solutions for low fertility and an aging society. CheongwadaeHer remarks were the latest in a series of pressure against the Assembly that wrapped up its last regular plenary session without endorsing the administration\u2019s key economic bills.On Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting, Park had said, \u201cIf the parliament speaks of job creation on one hand, but deters the labor reform bill legislation on the other, the people\u2019s expectations will turn into disappointment and anger.During Thursday\u2019s meeting to endorse the government\u2019s plan to provide some 135,000 homes for newlyweds in the next five years and create 370,000 new jobs for the youth, Park said, \u201cThe reason for late marriages is that young people cannot find themselves a decent job.\u201d\u201cHaving neither job stability nor a fixed income, they conceive marriage as something beyond their power.\u201dIt was the second time since this February that Park chaired the fertility policy committee meeting. \u201cIf our country fails to solve this problem now, young people will forget to love and continue to live in a repetitive everyday grind,\u201d Park said.South Korea started to address the low birthrate issue in 2005 when its total fertility rate, which is the average number of children a healthy woman would bear in her lifetime, reached a record low of 1.08.Spending some 80 trillion won ($68 billion) over the past 10 years, the nation saw the figure edge up to 1.205 last year, but still faces challenges in order to raise the number further to 2.1, the estimated replacement rate that would keep the population stable.The first step solution, the president claimed, is to improve the country\u2019s labor structure. \u201cThe government is pushing ahead with labor reform plans to create jobs for the young generation and to boost our economy, which requires cooperation and concessions from all people,\u201d Park said.\u201cWe must improve the labor market situation by extending the retirement age, rearranging the salary system and reducing working hours.\u201dThe parliament, having failed to approve the pending labor reform bills Wednesday, is expected to continue negotiations during the extraordinary sessions this month. But the given discussion is likely to drag on as the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy continue to lock horns over the parliamentary itinerary.By Bae Hyun-jung\u00a0(tellme@heraldcorp.com)","51":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has consolidated his power in a short period of time since he took office in late 2011, but the North's isolation has seriously deepened due to his obsession with nuclear weapons, analysts said.The North's young leader Kim inherited power four years ago when his father Kim Jong-il died of heart failure.In his late 20s, Kim became the North's leader just three years after he was anointed the heir-apparent, necessitating his drive to consolidate power in a short period of time.\"Kim chose the reign of terror for a governing style,\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. \"He has brutally dealt with disobedient officials while displaying the image of a caring leader for ordinary North Koreans.\"Since assuming power, Kim has executed around 100 party and military officials, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy.He ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle Jang Song-thaek for treason two years ago. Former defense chief Hyon Yong-chol was killed with an anti-aircraft gun over his alleged disloyalty to Kim.The iron-fisted rule has helped the North's leader reshuffle old-time officials and set up his own legacy, but a growing number of officials are also disenchanted with his rule, seeking asylum in South Korea and other countries, experts said.\"What strikes in the North's power structure is an emergence of new power elites in their 40s and 50s,\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. \"A shift in generations will continue among party officials.\"Analysts said that the planned congress of the ruling Worker's Party of Korea will be a watershed for gauging the direction of Kim's governing rule.The WPK plans to hold the congress for the first time in more than three decades in May where Kim is likely to conduct reshuffle and unveil a new line of state policies.Yang said Kim may loosen the severity of the reign of terror ahead of the key party event, but his pursuit of purges will continue as it is a common governing style in dictatorial socialist countries.Touching on external affairs, North Korea has seen its isolation deepen under Kim's regime due to the country's persistent pursuit of nuclear weapons program. The North has conducted nuke tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.Kim is seeking a dual pursuit of developing nuclear arsenals and boosting its fragile economy, commonly known as the \"byeongjin\" policy. Seoul and Washington have warned that the North's dual-track policy a dead end for it.Also he has not held any summit with leaders from other countries including China, the North's traditional ally.Relations between North Korea and China have been sharply strained since the North's 2013 nuke test though some signs of improvement have emerged since October when a ranking Chinese official visited the North for a military parade.Meanwhile, South and North Korea reached a rare deal in August on defusing military tension following heightened tension sparked by a landmine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.The two sides are scheduled to hold a vice-ministerial meeting on Friday to discuss pending issues, but there is a big gap between the two over main agenda items for the talks.Seoul puts a priority on regularize reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War while Pyongyang calls for the early resumption of a suspended joint tour program at Mount Kumgang in the North.\"Whether to resume the tour program is not a simple issue as it is linked to the North's nuclear problem as U.N. Security Council sanctions on the North bans transfer of bulk cash to Pyongyang,\" said Chang Yong-seok, a researcher at the Seoul National University Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.He also said that the North is facing very serious isolation as it is under relevant U.N. sanctions banning the North's nuke and missile tests.\"North Korea is expected to focus on handling external relations for the time being ahead of the party congress,\" he said.

(Yonhap)","55":"South Korean men spend the least amount of time on housework among 29 surveyed members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, highlighting the persistent gender imbalance in household responsibilities.According to the work-life balance index published Monday by Statistics Korea and Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, South Korean men spent an average of 45 minutes a day on household chores, less than a third of the OECD average of 139 minutes. South Korea was the only country, along with India (52 minutes) where men devoted less than an hour to housework. South Korean women spent 227 minutes on household chores a day on average, five times longer than men. But the amount of time is shorter than the OECD average of 274 minutes, with only women from Sweden (207 minutes) and Norway (215 minutes) spending less on domestic chores than Korean women. Statistics Korea and the Gender Ministry compiled data from the OECD statistics that studied 29 member countries about the time adults of each gender spent on \u201cunpaid work\u201d from 1999 to 2011. Unpaid work refers to various household tasks including shopping for groceries, cooking, cleaning and child care. The gap between Korean men and women was seventh highest in the OECD bloc. Norway marked the least with 31 minutes and India marked the largest with 300 minutes in terms of the gender disparity. But the gender imbalance is steadily narrowing among Korean men and women from double-income households, the statistics showed. Korean husbands from double-income households spent only 32 minutes on housework in 2009, but the amount of time increased by three minutes to 40 minutes in 2014. During the same period, the time working women spend on domestic tasks decreased from 208 minutes to 194 minutes. In South Korea, the number of double-income household stands at 5.18 million, accounting for 43.9 percent of the total married households in 2014. The marital status also affected the amount of time women spent on housework, with married women devoting 259 minutes in a stark contrast to unmarried ones spending only 63 minutes.The report shed light on the women\u2019s careers disrupted by childrearing, with 21.8 percent of married women having quit their jobs to get married, give birth or raise a child. Among them, married women in their 30s experienced career disruption the most at 53.1 percent, followed by those in their 40s at 29.8 percent and those aged between 15 and 29 at 8.6 percent, according to the data. Nearly 37 percent of the women pointed to marriage for their decision to leave their job, while 29.9 percent of them cited childrearing and 24.4 percent mentioned pregnancy and giving birth. Both Korean women and men increasingly take paternity leave to take care of their children, with the number of those on paternity or maternity leave having risen by 10.4 percent from a year earlier. But the parental leave appears to put Koreans\u2019 careers at risks, with only 59.6 percent of those taking the paid leave returning to their original workplaces, the data showed.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","56":"The Unification Ministry on Monday launched an online archive on German unification to raise public awareness of unification issues and help prepare for inter-Korean reunification.\u00a0\u00a0The archive (http:\/\/germanunification.unikorea.go.kr) is a collection of 2,152 documents, reports and other material on the German unification, including 926 items transferred from the German government, according to the ministry.\u00a0\u00a0\"We hope the German unification archive will promote public interest and participation in unification and help relevant organizations and experts carry out preparations and research on unification,\" a ministry official said.\u00a0 \u00a0About half of the documents have yet to be disclosed following authorization from their authors.\u00a0\u00a0\"Starting next year, we will request permission to use the private research material and expand the range of original text available and increase user convenience,\" the official said.\u00a0\u00a0The archive's launch comes as this year marks 70 years since Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule and 25 years since German unification.

A collaboration with the Odense City Museum in Denmark, the exhibition titled \u201cI Belong to the World\u201d showcases the classic writer\u2019s artifacts, including his bed, manuscripts and hand-cut paper crafts, as well as artworks by Danish Queen Margrethe II and late American artist Andy Warhol (1928-87), who were inspired by Andersen.Visitors can also read his books and engage in interactive activities such as watching films, making paper artworks and building with Lego blocks.\u00a0 Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann speaks at the exhibition titled \u201cI belong to the world,\u201d which displays artifacts and artworks of Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald\u201cHans Christian Andersen is an integral part of Danish culture,\u201d said Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann in a speech at the opening ceremony on Thursday. \u201cTwo hundred ten years since his birth, his more than 150 fairy tales continue to enchant children around the world with magical plots, fascinating characters and everlasting moral messages.\u201d Andersen, born in Odense, wrote fairytales, plays, travelogues, novels and poems that have been translated into over 125 languages. His masterpieces, most notably \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes,\u201d \u201cThe Nightingale,\u201d \u201cThe Snow Queen\u201d and \u201cThe Ugly Duckling,\u201d have inspired ballets, animations, films and plays.

The government had tried to introduce it in 1997, 2007 and 2009, to tide over economic difficulties, but in vain.Among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea and Iceland have not officially adopted daylight saving time, according to the finance ministry.

The negotiators are set to produce a deal that is to be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below2 degrees Celsius.\u00a0\u00a0 In Prague, Park met with the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia in the inaugural summit between South Korea and the so-called Visegrad Group.\u00a0\u00a0 Park also held separate talks with all four leaders in Prague, which were dominated by Park's sales pitch for South Korea's nuclear reactors and her push to make inroads into infrastructure markets.\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea said the Visegrad Group countries are pursuing major infrastructure projects expected to be worth over 50 trillion won ($43 billion).\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea also hopes that the experience of the Visegrad Group in embracing democracy and market economy could be a lesson for South Korea at a time when it is pursuing a peaceful unification with North Korea.\u00a0\u00a0 \"There are many areas in which to cooperate with these countries to help North Korea embrace change,\" Park told South Korean residents, noting the Visegrad Group had the experience of transforming into a democracy and a market economy following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u00a0\u00a0 She has called reunification a \"bonanza\" for South Korea as well as a blessing for surrounding countries.\u00a0\u00a0 Still, North Korea has long suspected that Seoul could be plotting to absorb Pyongyang, a claim denied by South Korea.

The project was not originally part of the budget plan.\"We plan to receive applications from universities in the first half of next year and then choose three to five of them to lead unification education,\" the official said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity. \"When the chosen universities hold lectures and seminars on unification and North Korea, they will receive financial support.\"The government hopes the new project will help university students take greater interest in unification issues, as they have become increasingly preoccupied with finding jobs.Under next year's budget plan, the ministry will also receive 10 billion won to build a cultural center aimed at fostering understanding between South Koreans and North Korean defectors in the South. (Yonhap)","64":"President Park Geun-hye and the prime ministers of the Czech Republic and three other central European countries pressed North Korea Thursday to stop its nuclear and missile programs and return to the negotiating table.South Korea and the so-called Visegrad Group \"urged North Korea to respond to diplomatic efforts to create favorable conditions for the resumption of six-nation talks,\" according to a joint statement issued after the summit.The Visegrad Group is composed of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.North Korea has vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear program as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy against it. The nuclear talks -- which involve the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan -- were last held in 2008.It marked the first time that Park has held summit talks with Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka and the prime ministers of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.They also voiced their opposition to any actions that raise tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Just days before, North Korea's test launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile ended in failure.South Korea and the U.S. said the North's failed test constitutes violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban North Korea from conducting a launch using ballistic missile technology.Park and the leaders of the Visegrad Group also called on North Korea to improve its dismal human rights record.North Korea has long been accused of grave human rights abuses, ranging from holding political prisoners in concentration camps to committing torture and carrying out public executions.Still, the North has denied any rights abuses, describing the accusations as a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime, and claiming it has the world's most advantageous human rights conditions and policies.Park and the leaders of the Visegrad Group also said the Ukraine ceasefire deal reached in the Belarusian capital of Minsk should be swiftly and fully implemented as they reaffirmed their support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.They said the situation in Eastern Ukraine can be resolved through peaceful agreement.Park and the leaders of the Visegrad Group also agreed to hold close consultations in a wide range of areas, including climate change, counterterrorism and cybersecurity.\"We agreed to actively join efforts to root out terrorism,\" Park said in a joint news conference with the four leaders after their summit.Sobotka said the foreign ministers between South Korea and the Visegrad Group plan to hold a meeting on a regular basis to boost cooperation, without giving a time frame. Separately, the sides agreed to consider setting up high-level talks meant to explore cooperation in infrastructure.An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, told reporters that South Korea hopes to make inroads into infrastructure in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.The four central European countries are pursuing major infrastructure projects expected to be worth over 50 trillion won ($43 billion), according to Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office.Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said in the news conference that he hopes South Korea and the Visegrad Group cooperate in nuclear energy, noting the sides share a common stance on the issue.Earlier in the day, Park held a separate meeting with Sobotka and made a sales pitch again for South Korea's nuclear reactors for the Czech Republic.In May, the Czech Republic announced its plan to build two nuclear reactors expected to be worth over 10 trillion won ($8.6 billion) and is scheduled to select a successful bidder in 2019.The central European country currently relies on six nuclear reactors to meet 35 percent of its energy needs.Park also asked Sobotka to consider buying South Korea's Surion helicopter for a Czech acquisition project of multi-purpose attack helicopters, according to Cheong Wa Dae.Also Thursday, Park held three separate meetings with the prime ministers of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.Park called for cooperation from Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo to ensure South Korean companies can participate in massive infrastructure projects being pursued by Poland.Szydlo said she is confident that the two countries can explore specific cooperative projects, noting there is a possibility of development in infrastructure and innovation.Park also made a similar request to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban over subway renovations and other infrastructure projects in Hungary.Meanwhile, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico asked South Korean companies to participate in a project to build an airport in his country and proposed that the two countries discuss how to cooperate in nuclear energy next year. (Yonhap)","65":"The National Assembly late Wednesday passed legislation that authorizes the government to impose taxes on religious leaders who have been exempt from taxation since the establishment of the South Korean government in 1948. Nearly 50 years after repeated and failed attempts to revise the law, lawmakers managed to add religious workers to the taxable list despite vehement opposition from South Korea\u2019s big churches, one of the most influential voting groups in Korea\u2019s conservative bloc.\u00a0Korea is the only country that exempts religious leaders from taxation among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members.\u00a0 Members of the National Assembly attend a plenary session on Wednesday. (Yonhap)But the prospects of implementing the bill remain to be seen as the big church groups and religiously conservative lawmakers continue to oppose the tax scheme.\u00a0Mindful of the opposition, lawmakers decided to implement the law from 2018, a year after the 2016 general elections and 2017 presidential election. They also decided to exempt religious organizations from taxation and provide them with wider tax benefits than given to average taxpayers. For example, a religious leader whose annual income is less than 400 million won ($344,000) can enjoy an 80 percent tax credit. Their spending on student loans, food expenses and travel costs are classified as nontaxable income. The tax rate ranges from 6 to 38 percent depending upon their income brackets. But some Korea\u2019s big churches dismissed the legislation as a \u201cpremature\u201d move that neglects to acknowledge that most churches are struggling to finance their organization during the economic downturn. \u201c(The government) should make churches voluntarily pay their taxes, as opposed to enacting a law that forces churches to pay,\u201d said the Christian Council of Korea, one of Korea\u2019s biggest church associations, in a statement released Wednesday. While urging the government to forgo implementation, the CCK threatened to launch an \u201canti-campaign\u201d during the 2017 general election against those lawmakers endorsing the move. In a vote during Thursday\u2019s plenary session, 195 lawmakers approved the bill, while 20 opposed and 50 abstained. Faced with pressure, some lawmakers who enjoy popularity among Christian groups upped their opposition. The coalition of lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy voiced their concerns over the negative impacts of the taxation scheme. Highlighting that Korean Protestants were the main supporters of the Saenuri Party in the past elections, Rep. Lee Jae-oh, who also works as a deacon in his church, asserted that the government should push for implementation after his party wins the 2017 and 2018 elections. Other Saenuri Party members hinted at the possibility the administration who took power after 2018 would scrap the legislation. Rep. Kang Suk-hoon noted that the Assembly would revisit the bill unless the general public reaches consensus on the bill. Rep. Lee Seok-hyun of the NPAD, vice speaker of the Assembly, went as far as to say that \u201cif we as religious people, try to impose taxes on money that we have given to Jesus and Buddha, how could we see their face after we die?\u201d\u00a0 According to a survey by local pollster Mono Research in November 2014, 75.3 percent of respondents said that the government should impose taxes on religious leaders. Since 1994, religious figures in Catholic churches have paid taxes. Buddhist temples and most Christian churches have agreed with the move.\u00a0By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@koreaherald.com)","66":"South Korean babies born in 2014 are expected to live more than 82 years as medical advances and efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle reduce death risks, a government report showed Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0According to the report by Statistics Korea, the life expectancy of babies born last year averages 82.4 years, up from the previous year's 81.9 years. \u00a0\u00a0Male and female babies are expected to live 79 years and 85.5 years, respectively. The figures are higher than the previous year's tally of 78.5 years and 85.1 years. \u00a0\u00a0This means a baby boy born last year has a 56.8 percent chance of reaching 80, while the chances of a baby girl becoming an octogenarian stood at 77.9 percent. Corresponding numbers for a boy reaching 65 stood at 86.5 percent and 94.3 percent for a girl.\u00a0\u00a0The life expectancies for male and female babies here are 1.2 years and 2.4 years longer than the average for member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the report showed.\u00a0\u00a0Among members of the 34 developed market economies with high income, South Korea's life expectancy for men ranked 17th, while those for women stood at fourth place. \u00a0\u00a0The gap in life expectancy between men and women stood pat compared to the year before at 6.5 years.\u00a0\u00a0South Korea's gap is higher than the 5.2 year average for the OECD as a whole, and on par with countries like France and Japan.\u00a0\u00a0\"Although the life expectancy gap did not become smaller in 2014, there has been an ongoing trend of men catching up with women,\" the statistical office said. It said one reason for this development is less men succumbing to liver-related diseases. In 1985, the gap stood at 8.4 years.\u00a0\u00a0The chances that a person could die of cancer in the future stood at 28.4 percent for male babies and 16.9 percent for female babies. Both numbers are up vis-a-vis 2014 when they stood at 28.1 percent and 16.6 percent.\u00a0\u00a0If the death risk from cancer is excluded, the life expectancies for male and female babies would increase by 4.8 year and 2.8 years, each, the report said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The latest report also showed among babies born last year, a male baby could expect to enjoy 64.9 years of healthy living while the number for girls was slightly higher at 65.9 years.\u00a0\u00a0Among regions, people living in Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi Province have the highest life expectancy, while they were the lowest for the industrial city of Ulsan and mountainous Gangwon Province.\u00a0\u00a0The difference, the office said, stems from the availability of medical services, income levels and other social considerations.\u00a0(Yonhap)","67":"A U.S. Army brigade with some 4,500 troops will deploy to South Korea early next year as part of a regular rotation of forces, the Department of the Army announced.The 1st Cavalry Division's 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team will replace the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team that was deployed in June under a decision to replace a permanent brigade, which had been stationed in South Korea since 1965, with a rotational unit.Rotation takes place every nine months.\"The 1st Cavalry Division reflects mutual commitment between the Republic of Korea and the United States by providing continued support with a rotational force brigade to replace Black Jack brigade,\" Maj.

U.S. officials said the North also exaggerated progress and is many years away from developing an SLBM.Under U.N. resolutions, the North is banned from any ballistic missile activity.

Researchers from the school had initially studied the emissions rigging that led U.S. environmental authorities to launch a probe.\u201cWe are requesting the examination from the U.S. school because the Korean authorities failed to find (the defeat device software in the new engine cars).

The details of the examination plan will be released next week, it added. Earlier last week, the Ministry of Environment confirmed that Volkswagen cars with the old EA 189 engine used the defeat device software to fake the emissions in order to pass the local emissions test. It ordered a recall for some 125,000 vehicles here and fined the carmaker a penalty of 14.1 billion won ($12.2 million). The ministry, however, said that it has not found evidence of the problematic device being used in the new EA288 engine-equipped vehicles, adding that a further probe is underway.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The conference is set to run through Dec. 11 to try to produce a deal that will be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.\"The Paris conference is not the final destination. It is a new beginning,\" Park said. \"Let us rally together for a new climate regime.\"Still, negotiations do not appear to be easy as some countries are at odds over funds needed to tackle climate change.Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that a new climate deal must include a clause on financial assistance to developing countries by advanced countries and that advanced countries must keep their promise to create US$100 billion each year.A total of 184 countries -- which account for 94 percent of global emissions -- have put forward climate targets for post-2020.In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.Park vowed to spearhead efforts to cut carbon emissions through new energy industries and meet South Korea's climate target.South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju \"will transition into a carbon free island by replacing its entire fleet of cars with electric vehicles and meeting 100 percent of its energy needs through renewable energy sources,\" Park said.She also said net zero buildings will be mandated in phases and large plants will eventually be transformed into smart factories that harness information and communications technologies.\"These efforts will enable us to unlock a new market in the neighborhood of US$100 billion by the year 2030 and generate some 500,000 jobs,\" Park said.She also vowed to join discussions to set up a global carbon market with enthusiasm, saying the market for carbon will \"no doubt play a critical role under the new climate regime.\"Also Monday, Park called for collaboration among countries to help make clean energy widely affordable.\"No single nation can, on its own, succeed in tackling climate change and innovating clean energy technology,\" Park said in the text of her speech posted on the website of Mission Innovation.\"More countries should join Mission Innovation to share their technologies and conduct collaborative research in promising new fields,\" Park said. South Korea joined hands with the United States, China and 17 other countries in launching Mission Innovation to reinvigorate and accelerate public and private global clean energy innovation to make clean energy widely affordable.Park also called for financial assistance and technology transfer to developing countries to ensure the new climate regime takes off successfully.The participants of Mission Innovation said in a joint statement that they will seek to double its governmental and state-directed clean energy research and development investment over five years.

The Seoul Turkish Film Festival at Arirang Cine Center from Nov. 25-28 was a collaboration between the municipalities of Beyoglu in Istanbul and Seongbuk-gu in Seoul, the Turkish Cinema and Audiovisual Culture Foundation, the Turkish Prime Ministry and the Turkish embassy. Internationally recognized films \u201cThe Goal of My Life\u201d (2008), \u201cNight of Silence\u201d (2012), \u201cOnce upon a Time\u201d (2015), \u201cMix Tape\u201d (2014) and \u201cBut Muzeyyen, That\u2019s the Deepest Desire\u201d (2014) were shown, along with \u201cThe Extremely Tragic Story of Celal Tan and his Family\u201d (2011), which was showcased at the opening ceremony on Wednesday.

Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald.\u201cThe Turkish cinema industry, which celebrated its centennial anniversary last year, has been critically acclaimed around the world in recent decades,\u201d Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal said in a speech. \u201cIt is remarkable that the Beyoglu municipality in Istanbul has organized this event, as it has been the heart of our 100-year-old national cinema as well as the city\u2019s cultural center.\u201d The first Turkish film was a documentary titled \u201cDemolition of the Russian Monument at San Stefano,\u201d directed by Fuat Uzkinay in 1914. Making use of the postwar cultural space, Turkey\u2019s cinema boomed along the narrow Yesilcam Street in Beyoglu, where actors, directors, technical workers and studios congregated. During its heydays from the 1950s to \u201970s, Yesilcam, meaning the \u201cGreen Pine,\u201d came to represent the national industry, producing between 250 and 350 movies a year. From the 1960s to the early 1970s, Turkey became the world\u2019s fifth-largest producer with around 300 movies generated annually. The industry saw a decline in the 1980s with the rise of television, but Yesilcam has been on a path of revitalization since 2002, with renewed global interest in Turkish culture through films such as \u201cUzak,\u201d \u201cBabam ve Oglum\u201d and \u201cPropaganda.\u201d\u00a0(From left) A Korean translator, Beyoglu Municipality project manager Derya Can, Prime Ministry representative Yusuf Sogutdelen, Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal and Seongbuk-gu Municipality Mayor Kim Young-bae.

Building on these successes, later generations of filmmakers, such as Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Fatih Akin and Ferzan Ozpetek, have triumphed at prominent international festivals, including Cannes, the Oscars, the Berlin festival, the Venice festival and the Montreal festival.In recent years, Turkish cinema has found popular audiences also in Europe, the Middle East, the United States and Asia. \u201cA nation\u2019s history does not exist without culture. Culture and the arts produce a nation,\u201d said film director Reyis Celik, who participated in the opening ceremony. \u201cKorea is famous for its high-tech products, but as artists, we are not interested in that. We developed curiosity about Korea through your deep films.\u201dBy Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","76":"The elderly and those living in one of the least affluent districts in Seoul were at the highest risk of taking their own lives, government data showed Sunday. According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate in Seoul stood at 24.7, meaning 24.7 Seoul residents in 100,000 committed suicide last year, as the nation\u2019s average suicide rate was 27. By age group, Seoul citizens aged 60 or over had the highest suicide rates, with 50.3 seniors taking their own lives last year alone. The suicide rate for those aged 45 to 64 was the second highest at 31.9, followed by those aged 25 to 44 at 27.9 and those aged 15 to 24 at 10.4.Poverty among the elderly has been blamed for the growing rate of senior citizen suicide here. According to the Korea Labor Institute, 48.6 percent of the country\u2019s elderly were living in poverty in 2014, defined as living off of 50 percent or less of median household income.Experts have also pointed out that the elderly who commit suicide mainly fall into two groups: those who do not want to burden their children with financial issues and those who grow estranged from their families as they get older.By district in Seoul, those living in Jungnang District, one of the poorest districts in Seoul by household income, saw the highest suicide rate at 35.7, while residents in Seocho District, one of the richest districts in Seoul, saw only 15.3 people in 100,000 having killed themselves last year.According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, Gangnam District was the richest among 25 districts in Seoul, collecting 104 billion won ($89.9 million) in income taxes, while Jungnang District raked in only 3.6 billion won. Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate that Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among its 34 member countries, with 29.1 Koreans per 100,000 people taking their own lives, compared to the OECD average of 12.1.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","77":"North Korea appears to have failed to launch a ballistic missile from a submarine in yet another provocative action that may escalate tensions on the peninsula, government sources in Seoul said Sunday. The communist state is believed to have tried to fire a KN-11 missile from a submarine in the East Sea between 2:20 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. Saturday, but it stopped short of soaring from the waters, the sources said. Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to officially confirm the report. \u201cThe cover of the capsule where the missile was placed has been found,\u201d one source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\u00a0 An image published in North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper on May 9 shows a ballistic missile believed to have been launched from underwater. (Yonhap)The discovery marks the first test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile since May, when Pyongyang claimed it had successfully ejected a \u201cstrategic submarine ballistic missile\u201d from the waters while leader Kim Jong-un observed. The test of a dummy projectile took place from a newly developed 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine at a shipyard in Sinpo, during which it is widely known to have flown about 150 meters. The North was likely to carry out the latest experiment at the same place, instead of using a ground SLBM launchpad believed to be incomplete. Concerns had arisen in recent weeks that the Kim Jong-un regime may be counting down to a fresh rocket test after it set an extensive no-sail zone in the waters off its eastern coastal city of Wonsan, effective from Nov. 11 to Dec. 7. Seoul forecasts that it will take at least two years for Pyongyang to be able to deploy a submarine carrying a ballistic missile, and Saturday\u2019s perceived failure may demonstrate that it has yet to master the technology. With ejection marking a crucial early stage in the SLBM development, the new test is deepening concerns as despite the failure it could help eventually secure a second-strike capability, boost the country\u2019s nuclear deterrence and thus bring its threat to a new high. Missile launches from submerged vessels are more challenging to detect than land-based ones.Pyongyang is believed to have conducted a series of ejection tests as part of its drive to secure the triad of delivery tools of a nuclear arsenal, consisting of strategic bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles and SLBMs. It is believed to operate some 70 submarines, about 20 of which are the 1,800-ton Romeo-class and about 40 of which are the 325-ton Sangeo-class vessels. Albeit old and equipped with outdated weapons, they outnumber South Korea\u2019s fleet.The findings came just a day before President Park Geun-hye departs for Paris for a U.N. climate change conference where she will gather with the leaders of more than 140 countries, including U.S. President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been seeking to visit Pyongyang.Last Thursday, the two Koreas also agreed to hold high-level talks in the North\u2019s western border city of Gaeseong on Dec. 11.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","78":"A major umbrella labor group said Sunday it will press ahead with a massive protest rally in central Seoul next weekend.It heralds another clash between protesters and police following a fierce street stand-off in mid-November.At that time, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against President Park Geun-hye's labor and education policies. Police used tear gas and water cannons against the violent demonstrators.Police announced that they would prohibit the second rally slated to be held at Seoul Plaza on Dec. 5.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions accused police of \"regressing to the dictatorial era.\"\"Police are denying the constitutional rights to the freedom of protest rallies, and it's tantamount to the self-acknowledgement that the current government is a dictatorship,\" it said in a statement.There is no change in the plan for another round of massive street protests next week, it added.President Park Geun-hye has vowed not to tolerate \"illegal\" demonstrations and instructed officials to come up with strong measures to root out violent protests.During the Nov. 14 rally, 51 demonstrators were rounded up and the number of people under investigation reached 270, according to the National Police Agency.The violent demonstration also caused 29 demonstrators to be rushed to hospitals after sustaining injuries.Among the injured was a 69-year-old farmer, surnamed Baek, who suffered a brain hemorrhage after being knocked down by a police water cannon. According to the NPA, 113 police officers were injured during the protest, 50 police buses were damaged and 231 items of police equipment, including walkie-talkies and rain coats, were lost or broken. Police estimated the damage at 389 million won ($337,000) and are planning to seek compensation through a lawsuit.The KCTU threatened to go on a general strike unless the government rolls back its push for making the labor market more flexible.It added it's vigilant against a possible raid by police into the Jogye Temple in Seoul, where Han Sang-gyun, head of the KCTU, has taken shelter.An arrest warrant has been issued for Han for organizing illegal rallies.The KCTU claimed chances are high that police will raid the temple while President Park is on a weeklong overseas trip.She left for France on Sunday to attend a U.N. conference on climate change.

At that time, the two Koreas had agreed to hold such talks either in Seoul or Pyongyang.Inter-Korean relations have showed signs of improvement as both sides eked out the deal following heightened tension over a land-mine blast blamed on the North in early August. The incident maimed two South Korean soldiers near the border.As part of the deal, the two Koreas held reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War in late October. They still remain technically at war as the conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\"The government plans to prepare for the upcoming high-level talks in a bid to help the inter-Korean ties genuinely improve,\" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a press briefing.He said that at the working-level meeting, Seoul pointed out the urgency of resolving the issue of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.\"North Korea, for its part, claimed that the resumption of a joint tour program at Mount Kumgang is the pressing issue,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The North did not make any comment on Seoul's punitive sanctions against Pyongyang following the North's deadly sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010.North Korea has repeatedly called on the South to resume the Mount Kumgang tour program, a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, as it faces difficulty in earning hard currency under a set of sanctions by the U.N. Security Council.The tour has been put on hold since 2008, following the death of a South Korean female tourist by a North Korean solider at the scenic resort.Meanwhile, Seoul is seeking to hold family reunions on a regular basis as time is running out for the separated family members, whose number reaches more than 66,000 in South Korea. But the North has not responded to Seoul's call so far.The upcoming talks are expected to help bring rapprochement to the Seoul-Pyongyang relations if the two sides can yield tangible results, analysts said.The agreement also came as discussion is under way for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to visit North Korea. It is not clear if or when such a trip will occur, but if realized, his visit would help better inter-Korean ties.

(Yonhap)","81":"The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the fixed amount of performance-based bonus paid on a regular basis should be considered part of workers\u2018 regular wages, in a landmark ruling that effectively handed a victory to 1,025 employees of GM Korea in their legal dispute against the company. South Korea\u2019s top court upheld a ruling by a lower court that said GM Korea should include its monthly paid bonus and family allowance as part of the regular wages, which forms the basis for calculating each employees\u2018 additional allowances. The ruling marked the first time the Supreme Court reached a decision specifically on the performance-based salaries in relation to regular wages. The court had ruled in December 2013 that regularly paid bonuses should be regarded as regular wages. Korean law stipulates that regular wages are hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or contracted fees paid to a worker routinely, but there has been consistent dispute over whether it should also include regularly paid bonuses and allowances.Debate over the scope of regular pay was ignited in 2013 when GM chief Daniel Akerson requested President Park Geun-hye address the regular wages issue before the company invested an additional $8 billion into the country.The ruling Saenuri Party has been revising the labor law as part of labor reforms. The revised version excludes additional payments based on each employee\u2018s circumstance or performance. The Federation of Korea Trade Unions welcomed the court\u2019s decision and called on the government and the ruling party to \u201cimmediately stop their push to expand the scope of excluded categories from the regular wages.\u201dThursday\u2019s ruling is likely to have rippling effects throughout the industry, which has complained over possible surges in personnel expenses if the regular wages encompass the bonuses and allowances.The 2013 ruling, meanwhile, had said that an employee\u2019s right to receive the unpaid wages may be restricted if the company\u2019s operations would be greatly disrupted by the payment, leaving room for different interpretations over how to measure a company\u2018s anticipated hardship.Since 2006, GM Korea has been paying what is referred to in Korea as \u201caccomplishment salaries,\u201d a form of bonus based on the respective workers\u2019 performance evaluation the year before. The bonus is set as high as seven times the amount of each employee\u2018s monthly base pay, and is handed out on a monthly basis.But when GM Korea excluded the accomplishment salary and other allowances when setting regular wages, employees filed a lawsuit against the company in 2007. GM Korea has said the bonus should be excluded, as it differs for each employee, but the workers said it is regularly paid and has a fixed rate.\u201cSince the amount of accomplishment salary is already fixed in the year that they are paid, it should be included in the regular wages,\u201d the court said in its ruling. It stipulated the criteria for regular wages as regularity, fixed rate and uniformity, and pointed out the bonus is paid to even first-year workers with no previous performance record.But the court remanded the case of including other allowances \u2015 such as for insurance fees and vacations \u2015 as part of the regular salary to the Seoul High Court. In a separate case on Nov. 2, Seoul High Court turned down five GM Korea workers\u2019 lawsuit against the company to pay them extra fees that would have incurred if their past regular wages included regularly paid bonuses.It pointed out that paying the extra wages would cause great difficulties to the company, which had already suffered from an annual loss of 60 billion won ($52.3 million) from 2008 to 2010. But the court handed victory to 933 workers of Korea Southern Power Co. Ltd. on a similar request, pointing out that paying the additional wages would not force the company into hardships.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","82":"From the streets leading to the National Assembly in Seoul where a state funeral was held for late President Kim Young-sam to the National Cemetery where he was laid to rest, South Koreans bade a final farewell on Thursday to the iconic democracy fighter who ended decades of military rule.Kim, who died Sunday, was honored at the state funeral in front of the parliament with more than 10,000 guests attending.

(Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye, who had a tense relationship with Kim, was absent from the service. Her decision not to attend was due to the chilly weather that could worsen her high fever and cold ahead of her trip to France on Sunday, her aides said.The president instead visited Seoul National University Hospital before a limousine carried Kim\u2019s body to the state funeral in Yeouido. She also met with Kim\u2019s son Hyun-chul, and offered her condolence. Cheong Wa Dae said that, in doing this, she was attending a part of the funeral service. Former Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo also were not present.In a tearful eulogy delivered amid sprinkles of snow, former National Assembly Speaker Kim Soo-han, who had been Kim\u2019s close associate, honored the late president as a brave leader who buttressed the years of the nation\u2019s struggle toward the democracy.\u201cHe had lived a life of sacrifice and commitment, dedicating his everything for democracy and the rights of the people,\u201d the former speaker said.\u201cThe image of the president who risked his life to resist (the oppressive militant rulers) became the source of courage for all democratic forces.\u201d Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said in a funeral speech that Kim had left behind considerable achievements in the nation\u2019s development by conducting sweeping changes and reforms aimed at building a new Republic of Korea.\u201cIt is now our turn to build the peaceful, free and thriving nation he had hoped for,\u201d said Hwang, who served as the head of the state funeral committee.

Despite his democratic achievements, Kim ended his presidency as a lame duck, after failing to save the nation from the Asian financial crisis.Kim stepped away from politics after his retirement, but left a message of harmony and unity, his family said, which politicians from rival parties today pledged to carry forward in honor of his spirit.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","83":"South Korea should reflect on whether it has done enough to improve its stormy ties with Japan, a former South Korean foreign minister said Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0Yu Myung-hwan, who served as Seoul's top diplomat from 2008-2010 under the previous Lee Myung-bak administration, made the remark during a symposium on South Korea-Japan ties, which mark the 50th anniversary of normalization this year.\u00a0\u00a0Relations between the two countries, however, have been strained due to disputes over issues stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0\"I think there's a need to think about whether South Korea-Japan relations worsened even despite sufficient efforts on our part,\" he said at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \"In English, it's called complacency.\"\u00a0\u00a0Yu said his first and last overseas assignments during his 40-year diplomatic career were to Japan in 1976 and 2007-2008.\u00a0\u00a0The 1965 normalization treaty was made possible through political will despite difficult conditions at home and abroad, he said.\u00a0\u00a0\"I think we should build a new paradigm toward the next 50 years of South Korea-Japan relations,\" he said. \"I think we should create a new framework that is free from the history of the past, oriented toward the future, without placing a burden on future generations under a win-win atmosphere.\" (Yonhap)","84":"South and North Korea are set to hold a working-level meeting Thursday to prepare for high-level government talks as they seek to mend their long-strained ties, government officials said.\u00a0\u00a0The preparatory meeting is to take place on the North's side of the truce village of Panmunjom at around 10:30 a.m., a move to implement the August deal on defusing military tension.\u00a0\u00a0\"I will do my best to help get the inter-Korean deal fully implemented,\" Kim Ki-woong, Seoul's chief negotiator for the meeting, told reporters before leaving for the truce village.\u00a0\u00a0Breaking monthslong silence for Seoul's repeated dialogue offer last week, the North offered to hold the preparatory talks.

Health authorities declared a de facto end to the outbreak of MERS on July 29.Under the World Health Organization guidelines, the official declaration of an end to an outbreak cannot be made until at least 28 days after the last patient has tested negative for the virus.\u201cWe think it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about the declaration when a patient has just passed away,\u201d Kim Young-taek, an official from the Health Ministry told The Korea Herald. \u201cWe choose not to comment on any plans on the declaration for now.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","86":"The Transport Ministry on Wednesday approved Seoul City\u2019s plan to tear down the outdated overpass near Seoul Station and alter routes for smoother traffic flow.The ministry, however, said it was not a consent to the city\u2019s controversial plan to create a pedestrian park on the 1-kilometer flyover, and that the approval was only given as new traffic routes submitted by the city did not pose any problems.\u201cThis means we are approving a detour from the Seoul Station overpass, it does not mean that the overall traffic measure is perfect or that we are approving the creation of the park,\u201d the ministry said of the decision that came after months of deliberation.It added that while they are responsible for greenlighting the route changes, the traffic measures must be discussed with the police. Plans to use the overpass for other purposes, such as a park, should also be discussed with the Korea Rail Network Authority, it added.Seoul City, adamant about carrying out the project that has become one of Mayor Park Won-soon\u2019s signature urban projects, said it will be closing the overpass from Dec. 13. The overpass, which was constructed in the 1970s, received a grade \u201cD\u201d in a safety test in 2006. Instead of tearing it down, the mayor vowed last year to transform it into an elevated pedestrian park similar to the High Line Park in New York City as part of the city\u2019s urban restoration project. The plan, however, has faced hurdles, as the police delayed the review of the city\u2019s traffic measures, citing them as insufficient and saying the Transport Ministry\u2019s approval was required first. The city argued the police were deliberately delaying it on political motives. Some raised speculation the police had been influenced by the central government to contain Park, who is considered a potential presidential candidate for the main opposition party.The city had threatened to close the overpass from Nov. 29 and partially tear it down for safety purposes on its own authority. It is authorized to discretionally tear down construction or control and restrict traffic if there are obvious public safety risks.

On Monday, the Sewol Special Investigation Committee said it would look into how Cheong Wa Dae reacted to the emergency and what Park was doing for seven hours after the doomed ferry began to sink off the nation\u2019s southwestern coast on April 16, 2014. The president will be subject to the investigation if it is relevant to the case, the committee said.The decision brings a heated political debate back on the president who has been countering allegations that she had been away from the presidential compound when the tragedy occurred.Cheong Wa Dae has said that Park was in her office on April 16 last year while she received multiple reports on the accident.In one of the worst maritime disasters in South Korean history, the sinking of the ferry left 304 people dead or missing. Most of its victims were high students headed toward the resort island of Jejudo.

Of the 13 members attending, nine members approved, including five members recommended by the NPAD, while four members close to the ruling party boycotted the meeting. The members recommended by the opposition said the plan of tracing Park\u2019s whereabouts does not infringe upon the Constitution because it is not aimed at filing a criminal charge against the president.The ruling party members, meanwhile, vehemently opposed the idea, saying it would eventually lead to a criminal investigation against her.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","92":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent his key aide to a local farm in early November as punishment for the mishandling of a hydraulic power station construction project, South Korea's state spy agency said Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0Choe Ryong-hae, the communist party's secretary, appears to have been receiving re-education at a farm in an unidentified province starting this month due to his responsibility for water leakage from the newly built hydraulic power station, according to the National Intelligence Service.\u00a0\u00a0The NIS told lawmakers that Choe, secretary of the Worker's Party of Korea, was punished for the problem at the power station near the North's border with China.

A total of 22 members of civic group Countermeasure Committee for Public Livelihood said they filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen Korea CEO Thomas Kuehl for allegedly taking massive financial advantage by violating rules, and causing environment problems, thereby affecting the public health. This is the first time that a third party -- other than the automaker\u2019s customers -- has launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen. \u201cDue to Volkswagen\u2019s trickery, (we) have been defenselessly exposed to category-1-carcinogen-designated diesel emissions nearly every day from its vehicles, which has increased the probability of getting respiratory diseases,\u201d the plaintiffs said in the statement. \u201cAlthough there may have not been any direct physical damage for now, (the company) must at least financially compensate for the psychological shock, anxiety and concerns about the potential health impact.\u201d Separately, 44 members of the group filed a suit against a local car distributor for polluting the environment, seeking compensation of 300,000 won ($260) each, the organization said. Volkswagen drew global criticism in September after the carmaker admitted that it had cheated on its emissions standards compliance by installing software in some diesel-powered vehicles to pass the emission tests. Volkswagen Korea apologized to Korean customers and vowed to recall the problematic cars. Over 120,000 concerned vehicles have been sold in Korea, the German company said. The Korean branch of the global carmaker has faced a class-action lawsuit from nearly 2,000 customers who seek to nullify the purchase contracts and get a refund, according to law firm Barun, which is leading the lawsuit. The law firm has been filing a lawsuit every week upon requests from customers since late September. More are to join the collective legal battle, it added. The Environment Ministry launched its own test last month over whether the diesel engine Volkswagen vehicles here meet the emissions standard compliance under two tests -- outdoor driving test and indoor driving test. In an indoor driving test last month, the emissions of all the concerned vehicles recorded below the standard limit of 0.08 gram per kilometer, the ministry said.The outdoor driving test currently underway will last for more than a month. The results will be released next week, it added. Based on the result of the Environment Ministry\u2019s test, the Transport Ministry will probe the association between the emissions and fuel efficiency, officials said. If the emission rigging is confirmed here, the carmaker will likely face a penalty along with compensation lawsuits.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","98":"The head of South Korea's third-largest steelmaker received a 42-month jail term Thursday for gambling abroad with millions of dollars he embezzled.The Seoul Central District Court also ordered Chang Sae-joo, chairman of Dongkuk Steel Mill Co., to pay a fine of 10 million won ($8,600) and forfeit another 510 million won.The 62-year-old was indicted in May on charges of misappropriating more than 20 billion won from the company since 2003 and using part of it to gamble in Las Vegas.\"The defendant's crime incurred 12.7 billion won in losses to the company,\" Judge Hyun Yong-sun said.It is the second time Chang has been arrested on gambling charges.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will not visit North Korea next week, a U.N. spokesperson said Wednesday, denying a Chinese news report that Ban will make a rare trip to the North next week. \"The Secretary-General will not be traveling to the DPRK next week,\" a U.N. spokesperson said in a statement, referring to North Korea by the acronym for its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement said Ban will be in \"New York most of next week and then travel to Malta for the Commonwealth Summit.\" Citing the North's official Korean Central News Agency, China's state-run Xinhua reported from Pyongyang that Ban will arrive in the capital city next Monday and stay there for around four days. In May, Ban planned to visit the North Korean border city of Kaesong, where South Korea runs an industrial complex, but the trip was called off at the last minute because Pyongyang abruptly withdrew its invitation for no clear reason.Some analysts said at the time that Pyongyang appeared to have taken issue with Ban's remarks that North Korea's missile launches represent a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, has repeatedly said that he will do everything possible to promote inter-Korean reconciliation and a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. (Yonhap)","101":"North Korea unveiled detailed plans Wednesday to develop its special economic zone in the border city of Rason aimed at luring foreign investment amid an economic slowdown and a series of U.N. sanctions.The North made public the comprehensive plan in what is seen as part of efforts to turn the area into a regional logistics hub close to both China and Russia, according to North Korea's official portal site Naenara.North Korea has sought to develop the zone since it designated Rason, formerly known as Rajin and Sonbong, as a special economic zone in 1991. But its ambitious plan has faced serious setbacks as foreign investment remains lackluster due to the North's provocations.The North has undergone difficulty in earning hard currency due to heavy sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council following the North's nuclear and missile tests.In another attempt to revitalize the economic zone, North Korea said it plans to pursue development projects in seven areas, including tourism and logistics. It also unveiled a list of eight North Korean firms that will be able to create a joint venture with foreign companies.The North said that profits and other proceeds generated at the zone can be repatriated outside North Korea \"without restriction,\" in what is seen as investment incentives to foreign investors. It also hinted at assuring autonomous operations for firms at the zone.\"It is noteworthy that North Korean firms will be allowed to enter the economic zone, aided by foreign investment,\" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far East Studies of Kyungnam University.Analysts said the North's move indicates its attempt to boost its fragile economy by actively attracting foreign investment at a time when the North's international isolation is deepening.They said that the North's move may be aimed at achieving some accomplishments on the economic front ahead of its ruling party's congress slated for next year.The Workers' Party of Korea plans to convene the first congress in more than three decades in early May where the North may unveil a new line of policies.The North's move to foster logistics in the port of Rajin is also likely to lend support to a trilateral project which calls for the shipment of Russian coal to South Korea via the North's port, experts said.

YonhapHis frustration in finding a job in Korea reflects a changing trend among Koreans who once considered studying overseas as a ticket to success back home. Education authorities said Tuesday that the number of students who went abroad to study has plunged by two-thirds over the past eight years. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Education and Korean Educational Development Institute, 10,907 students left Korea to study overseas in 2014. In 2006 the number was 29,511. Of those in 2014,\u00a0about 40 percent\u00a0were elementary school students, with\u00a034 percent\u00a0being middle school students and\u00a026 percent\u00a0high school students. The 2006 statistics showed about 46 percent were elementary school students while\u00a031 percent\u00a0and 23 percent were middle and high school students, respectively. The number of Korean students who went overseas to study has fluctuated throughout the 2000s. Since 2000, when sending young children abroad to study became popular among parents, the number of students has increased annually with 2000 marking 4,397, 2001 showing 7,944 and 2002 at 10,132. Having peaked in 2006 when 29,511 left Korea to study, the number has been declining since then with 27,668 students in 2007, 27,349 students in 2008 and 18,118 during the 2009 financial crisis. Education officials estimated that, if trends continue, the total number of students studying abroad in 2015 would be less than 10,000. They attributed this to the widespread notion among young students that studying overseas does not automatically connect to better job prospects at home. \u201cBack in previous days, students believed that studying abroad would help them get a better job. ... But those benefits don\u2019t seem to exist anymore. Also, there are many domestic schools where students can learn English (without young students going abroad),\u201d said officials from the Ministry of Education. Human resources departments at Korean companies agreed that those who have studied overseas do not necessary land better jobs than their competitors who lack overseas educational experience.\u00a0 \u201cAdmittedly, companies are worried whether those who have graduated from colleges overseas would adjust to Korea\u2019s unique working environment.

(Yonhap)Yonhap news agency reported that the South Korean secretary-general would visit the North\u2019s capital city after his plan to travel to the North fell through in May due to the communist regime\u2019s rejection. In response, the U.N. spokesperson\u2019s office said it had \u201cno comment.\u201dShould he go to Pyongyang, it would be the first visit by an incumbent U.N. leader in 22 years.

But Pyongyang abruptly canceled his visit without elaborating on the reasons for the rejection. Observers say Ban\u2019s remarks against Pyongyang\u2019s potential launch of a rocket might have angered the North.Ban\u2019s reported plan to visit emerged as there has not been any significant progress in Seoul\u2019s efforts to improve cross-border ties despite growing bilateral civilian exchanges. In line with the Aug. 25 deal to defuse military tensions and enhance bilateral relations, Seoul has proposed government talks with Pyongyang three times since late September. But Pyongyang has spurned the proposals, arguing that they were insincere due to South Korean civic groups\u2019 continued distribution of anti-Pyongyang leaflets and Seoul\u2019s criticism of Pyongyang\u2019s potential provocations including a possible rocket launch and other issues.Analysts said that if Pyongyang has accepted Ban\u2019s visit, it might want to use the U.N. to ease international pressure over its woeful human rights record, and nuclear and missile programs.\u201cAs the U.N. is at the forefront of applying international sanctions against the North, Pyongyang may want to utilize Ban to help ease pressure against it vis-a-vis its nuclear program, human rights issues and others,\u201d said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University\u2019s Institute for Peace and Unification.He added that the North could also raise the issue of a peace treaty with the U.S., an issue that observers say the North seeks to utilize to divert international attention to the issue of its denuclearization.\u201cGiven the role of the U.S. to promote world peace and stability, Pyongyang might try to raise the issue of a peace treaty to replace the current armistice agreement,\u201d Chang said.

(Yonhap)","108":"The Education Ministry has requested disciplinary actions against teachers who participated in a nationwide condemnation of the recently revived state-authored history textbooks, officials said Sunday.According to the ministry, officials have called for punishment of 21,379 teachers from 3,904 schools across the country who publicly denounced the government\u2019s plan to use state-issued history textbooks for secondary education on Oct. 29. The governmental plan, which hinges on its claims that current privately authored textbooks are biased in favor of the leftists, has sparked criticism from mostly progressive educators and the opposition who claimed that the move will squash out diversity in history education.The ministry has requested the education offices to impose severe punishment \u2015 including dismissal, demotion or suspicion \u2015 on 22 members of the left-leaning Korea Teachers and Education Workers\u2019 Union who organized and led the movement. Teachers who did not take on a prominent role in the movement will be warned or receive relatively light punishment, according to the ministry.Korean law stipulates that civil servants \u2015 which include teachers for primary and secondary education \u2015 are banned from taking actions that can be interpreted as \u201cpolitical.\u201d The government has already filed for criminal charges against 84 KTU members for violating the cited clause. \u201cAs it is clear that (the public denouncement) is illegal, we believe that education superintendents will follow through on punishing the teachers. We will take appropriate actions if they do not comply,\u201d a ministry official said.But education superintendents, who reserve the right to impose disciplinary actions on teachers, may defy the ministry\u2019s move, as the majority of them are known to be progressive and have publicly decried the state textbook plans. Gangwon Education Superintendent Min Byung-hee said earlier this month that he has \u201cno justification to punish teachers who oppose state textbooks.\u201dThe KTU is planning to hold candlelight vigils in protest of the state textbooks from Monday to Friday this week, and is planning to hold another mass-scale protest on Friday.Recent polls indicate that anti-state textbook sentiment has billowed ever since the contentious plan was confirmed on Nov. 3. A Gallup Poll conducted during the first week of November showed that 53 percent of the respondents were against the policy while 36 percent supported it, showing the opposition growing from 49 percent the week before. Local teachers group Good Teachers Movement said Sunday that its survey showed 90.4 percent of the teachers in elementary, middle and high school oppose the policy, which marked a steep increase from 62.6 percent in their September poll. About 89 percent of the respondents disagreed with the government saying that people need a \u201cunified historical point of view.\u201dOn Saturday, the KTU and civic groups participated in a massive joint protest \u2015 in which tens of thousands are estimated to have participated \u2015 against the government\u2019s recent policies including the state textbook and labor reform plans. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has also raised suspicion that the ministry rigged petition tallies related to its state textbook plans, on grounds that many of the signed petitions supporting the plan had same addresses or handwriting.According to the ministry, 152,805 people submitted a written petition for the policy while 452,459 petitioned against it.\u00a0By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","109":"When it comes to curbing climate change, Norwegian scientist Jorgen Randers is a disbeliever. \u201cI\u2019m a pessimist because I do not think humanity will go the extra lengths to stop the earth from degenerating,\u201d the coauthor of influential book \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d (1972) told The Korea Herald on Thursday. \u201cBut I\u2019m working hard and hoping that it will. Humanity is capable of preventing such scenarios. The question is whether they will decide to do so.\u201dThe 70-year-old professor at the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo has been warning of an impending global environmental crisis for more than four decades. As the clock ticked toward the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Paris from Nov. 30-Dec. 11, with the goal to forge a legally binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, Randers offered a stern prognosis devoid of efforts to look politically correct. He visited Korea to participate in the Seoul International Energy Conference 2015 on Wednesday, where he advised Mayor Park Won-soon on making Seoul a people-oriented city using sustainable energies and policies.\u00a0 Jorgen Randers, professor at the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo and author of 1972 influential book \u201cThe Limits to Growth,\u201d speaks to The Korea Herald about the impending environmental catastrophes and urgent steps needed to tackle them. (Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea Herald)For the last several decades, climate scientists around the world have been drumming up gloomy forecasts of floods, droughts, hurricanes, rising seas, devastated agriculture and disappearing wildlife. Randers, who followed his 1972 seminal book with \u201c2052 - A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years,\u201d in 2012 said he was convinced that over the next forty years the arc of history would tilt toward his grim predictions. His new book describes in detail the consequences and implications of the current path of global development \u201cin the vacuum of extraordinary actions,\u201d covering population, economy, energy, environment and climate. The academic claimed that the world temperature would rise above 2 degrees Celsius by 2052, and 3 degrees Celsius by 2080, where it would stay for roughly a thousand years, the half-life of CO2. \u201cIs it bad?\u201d he asked, quickly answering: \u201cYes, it is. Dramatic action is required, such as capturing and storing the carbon released into the atmosphere.\u201dHaving served as the former director-general of the World Wide Fund for Nature in Switzerland, Randers projected that the low-lying Bangladesh, parts of the Mediterranean and islands in the Pacific were going to be hit particularly hard as seawaters rise about 30 centimeters. \u201cSummer will get longer and hotter, the dry areas will become drier and life will be over for most polar bears, except those living north of Canada,\u201d he underscored. \u201cFor us, these will be more inconveniences than catastrophes. Life will be unnecessarily complicated and unpleasant.\u201dThe key problem, according to the intellectual, lies in the short-sighted nature of democracy, which caters to immediate populist demands rather than longer-term public interests. Global institutions such as the United Nations had \u201cvery limited ability\u201d to administer the critically needed cures, he asserted, as the representative negotiators were constrained by their national parliaments. \u201cThe parliaments themselves, full of wise politicians, are checked by the voters, who don\u2019t want higher taxes, more regulations or expensive energies. As a result, they can\u2019t commit to dramatic cuts and changes.\u201dUnlike the democracies, Randers argued that China\u2019s authoritative style of government was actually better at solving the world\u2019s problems. \u201cThe only real mover in the world today is China,\u201d he said. \u201cIts unique governance based on an \u2018enlightened dictatorship\u2019 allows the Chinese Communist Party to rule above the popular mandate.\u201dHighlighting China\u2019s rapid ascendance since the market-oriented reforms were put into effect in the late 1970s, the scholar explained that the Chinese government was \u201cdelicately balancing\u201d its interests between wealth creation and growth management. China, which has added a great deal to climate change, is now moving briskly to improve energy efficiency, switching to renewables and limiting CO2 emissions by 2030, under the auspices of five-year plans, he pointed out. \u201cThey are doing this because in the long run, China itself benefits from a better climate,\u201d the scholar said. \u201cRainfall has moved from the populous northeastern China to the southwest, where there is excess water. Deserts are creeping in from the northwest.\u201dFor the rest of the world, a brighter future could be obtained by shifting 2 percent of the world\u2019s capital and labor from the \u201cdirty\u201d coal, oil and gas industries to the \u201cclean\u201d wind, solar and hydro energies, he indicated. As necessary steps, he added, population growth must be curtailed worldwide, particularly in advanced countries, to reduce ecological footprints; carbon emissions must be trimmed by taxing polluters and subsidizing renewables; and poverty must be eliminated and renewable energy capacity must be strengthened in poor countries. Randers also suggested promoting a higher environmental awareness and diverse well-being away from materialism. Nuclear power must be phased out, he emphasized. \u201cIt is \u2018immoral\u2019 to pass onto the later generations our own nuclear wastes and associated costs.\u201dKorea was \u201crich and civilized enough\u201d to depart from nuclear and adopt renewables, he said, which were becoming cheaper around the world. The professor praised the Seoul government for its sustainable urban policies under the banner \u201cOne Less Nuclear Power Plant Policy,\u201d introduced at the ICLEI World Congress in Seoul in April.Declared as the \u201cPromise of Seoul: Taking Actions against Climate Change,\u201d the plans include: cutting CO2 emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 40 percent by 2030; sharing energy with underprivileged communities; clipping greenhouse gas and air pollutants in an integrated system; encouraging recycling and slashing food waste; saving water; harnessing biodiversity; expanding urban farming; protecting public health from infectious diseases and heat waves; preventing climate disasters; and bolstering related international coalitions. \u201cWhat\u2019s lacking is the popular will to implement it,\u201d Randers said. \u201cMayor Park will have to collect more taxes to translate these plans into actions.\u201d Noting Korea\u2019s world-class expertise in information technology, National Strategy for Green Growth (2009-50) and hosting of international institutions such as the Green Climate Fund in the Songdo district of Incheon, the professor said Korea had the potential to lead the world in sustainable development. \u201cYou are now a laboratory for an embryonic green economy,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter developing your competence, you will be able to sell it around the world.\u201d By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","110":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could announce a dramatic policy change, comparable to economic reforms that China and Vietnam embraced in the 1980s, when he convenes a rare meeting of the ruling Workers' Party next year, a German expert said Wednesday.North Korea announced late last month that the seventh Congress of the Workers' Party will be held in early May next year. It would mark the first party congress in 36 years after the last such meeting was held in 1980, when Kim's grandfather and national founder Kim Il-sung was in power.The announcement spurred speculation as to why Kim decided to convene such a rare meeting.Ruediger Frank, a North Korea expert at the University of Vienna, said Kim could use the meeting for a \"declaration of his victory in the domestic struggle for power\" after massive purges in the past years or to announce a major policy change marking the departure down a path of true reform.Frank also noted that since Kim took power, the formal role of the Workers' Party has been restored, step by step, and such leading party organs as the central committee, the politburo and its presidium have been resuscitated.\"We should also remember that all major reforms of state socialism -- be it in China under Deng Xiaoping, the Soviet Union under Gorbachev or Vietnam under the slogan of doi moi -- have been announced at such regular party congresses or related events,\" he said in an article contributed to 38 North.Unlike his father and late leader Kim Jong-il who pursued \"songun,\" or military-first, policy, the current leader pursues the \"byeongjin\" policy of seeking both economic and nuclear development simultaneously, the expert said.\"Kim Jong-un has from day one of his leadership declared that he wants to improve the material living conditions of his people.He has tried to do that within the constraints of the existing system,\" Frank said. \"I had estimated that he would need about five years to find out that this does not work, that the system itself is the problem. The time is almost up.\"As Kim has consolidated his leadership and the economic situation in the North is relatively stable, the emerging middle class and the growing inflow of information from the outside, in particular via China, have put the regime under high pressure for reform, the expert said.However, Kim could use next year's meeting only to signal a \"return to a new normal,\" he said.\"Kim Jong-un might ... play it safe and, after having spent the last years cleaning the ranks of the party, military and government, will use the 7th Party Congress for a triumphant declaration of his victory in the domestic struggle for power. The country would return to a new normal and continue to muddle through,\" Frank said.In that case, the congress could only issue statements on internal cohesion and monolithic unity, celebrate the status of the country as a nuclear and space power, reshuffle a few posts, glorify the three Kims and emphasize the need for Korean unification, he said. (Yonhap)","111":"More than 630,000 high school seniors and graduates in South Korea took the state-administered annual college entrance exam Thursday, as the government implemented various traffic control and anti-noise measures near nationwide testing sites.A total of 631,187 students, down about 10,000 from last year, registered to take the standardized College Scholastic Ability Test that was administrated at 1,212 testing sites, according to Ministry of Education.The exam, which is similar to the American Scholastic Aptitude Test, is considered the most crucial test of students' academic careers and seen as the deciding factor in their choice of college and future professions.The exam, which consists mostly of multiple-choice questions, is divided into five sections -- Korean language, mathematics, English, social and natural sciences, and a second foreign language. The test started at 8:40 a.m. and was to run through 5 p.m., including lunch and breaks, the ministry said.As in previous years, the government imposed various traffic control and anti-noise measures as part of efforts to ensure that the significant test was executed without any glitches.Buses and subway trains extended their rush hour services by two hours to help all exam-takers arrive at the test sites on time, the ministry said. The stock markets opened for trade one hour late, while government offices and enterprises in nearby areas also opened an hour later than usual to keep the roads clear for students on their way to the test centers, it said. Police operated a temporary call center for students in need of a ride offering to transport them to the test centers by patrol car or on the back of a motorcycle.Test applicants were banned from having electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, electronic calculators and smart watches, at their desks on concerns they might be used to cheat, the ministry said. Second-year high school students gathered in front of testing sites in the pre-dawn hours to lend support to seniors taking the tests, waving placards reading \"Jackpot!\" and \"Strength for You!\"\"I arrived here at around 11 p.m. yesterday to get a good spot for cheering,\" said 17-year-old high school student Lee Seng-geun, singing a song for seniors with dozens of his friends.Parents were seen waiting outside test centers or praying in Buddhist temples. \"I packed my daughter's favorite lunch,\" a 48-year-old mother of a test taker in Seoul said, adding that she will visit a temple later in the day to pray for her daughter. Right after the beginning of the test, the government said it made the questions easier or similar to the previous year.\"This year's exam was similar to last year's,\" said Lee Jun-sik, head of the test development committee and a Chinese language and literature professor at Seoul's Sungkyunkwan University.The education ministry will announce the answers to the questions on Nov. 23, and the applicants will be individually notified of their test results by Dec. 2. (Yonhap)","112":"The months-long investigation into alleged corruption involving the nation\u2019s biggest steelmaker and its subcontractors came to a close Wednesday with the prosecution indicting former POSCO chairman Chung Joon-yang without detention. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office filed charges against the 67-year-old Chung for taking bribes and breaching his duties by causing financial losses to the nation\u2019s biggest steelmaker, it said in a press briefing Wednesday morning. Chung Joon-yang (Yonhap)The prosecution also indicted other key figures -- former POSCO vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa, 63, and Dongyang Construction chairman Bae Sung-ro, 60 -- without detention for their involvement in embezzlement, bribery and breach of trust. The move came seven months after the prosecution launched a probe in March into POSCO\u2019s alleged corruption upon a tip-off the steel giant had dubious deals with subcontractors, affiliates and high-profile politicians. Chung is suspected of masterminding dubious mergers and acquisitions deals during his term as chairman between 2009 and 2014, allegedly causing 159 billion won ($137.5 million) in losses to POSCO. In one example from 2011, he led the acquisition of a stake in plant equipment firm Sungin Geotec, owned by a close friend, for well over market value.\u00a0 Chung also allegedly exerted undue influence in getting a family member a job as a high-level official at Kosteel, a partner company of POSCO. Kosteel has been suspected of helping POSCO evade taxes by doctoring transaction records and creating slush funds. Lee Sang-deuk (Yonhap)\u00a0The prosecution additionally accused him of offering deals worth 1.2 billion won to small maintenance company TM Tech, run by a close aid of former President Lee Myung-bak\u2019s elder brother Lee Sang-deuk.In return, the 79-year-old former ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker allegedly exerted influence on government officials to appoint Chung as POSCO chairman and to lift planning restrictions so the company could resume its construction of a new steel factory in 2011. He was indicted without detention on influence peddling charges. The prosecution indicted former POSCO vice chairman Dong-hwa for creating a slush fund worth $5 million in Vietnam during his term in the office and embezzling a total of 1 billion won. He allegedly took kickbacks including cash and golf trips from the subcontractor in return for granting it business deals. He also gave an executive position at POSCO to a high-ranking government official\u2019s high school friend in early 2011.Bae Sung-ro, another key figure at the center of the corruption scandal, was indicted on charges of fraud. The former chairman of Dongyang Construction allegedly covered up his company\u2019s financial records to win construction bids and loans from state-run banks. He allegedly received preferential treatment from POSCO leaders in exchange for kickbacks and creating slush funds for POSCO and its affiliates.As a result of the probe, the prosecution shed light on widespread corruption cases stemming from the formerly state-run POSCO\u2019s heavy reliance on the government, its leadership\u2019s cozy relations with politicians and lax management. POSCO, which was established under the rule of former President Park Chung-hee and run by the government since then, began its privatization process in 1998 in the face of the Asian financial crisis. Though POSCO was completely privatized in 2000, its operation and appointment of the chief executives have been greatly swayed by the government.\u201cAs POSCO doesn\u2019t have a family owner, there were cases in which company executives with only a limited term colluded with politicians and gave favors to certain subcontractors (in connection with them),\u201d an official from the prosecution said. But prosecutors came under fire for dragging out the probe over months without a visible outcome, possibly taking a toll on the steel giant\u2019s business. Their multiple requests for detention warrants for Chung and Bae were rejected in the process due to a lack of evidence. The prosecution indicted a total of 32 people, mostly from POSCO and its subcontractors. Among them, 17 were detained. It plans to continue probing the six-term lawmaker Lee Byung-suk of the ruling Saenuri Party to see whether he was involved in the corruption case.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","113":"The government and the ruling Saenuri Party agreed Wednesday to inject an extra budget of more than 200 billion won ($180 million) to alleviate effects of the worst drought that has hit South Korea in more than a century.The budget will be used, among other things, to build irrigation pipelines to send water from the nation's four major rivers -- the Han, Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan -- to drought-stricken areas.\"The measure is to make use of the four rivers to bring the water closer to the affected areas,\" said Rep. Na Seong-lin of the Saenuri Party, who participated in the government-ruling party meeting.More than 700 million tons of water contained in the 16 newly built dams along the four rivers has so far remained useless because the dams are located far from the affected areas. The country remains gripped by the worst drought in more than a century, which is feared to hit hard agricultural production and bump up food and other consumer prices. The national weather agency forecasts that the current drought is highly likely to last until next April. (Yonhap)","114":"The global community should take further actions against North Korea's grave human rights violations as the situation has not improved despite international pressure, a United Nations investigator has said.Last December, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling on the Security Council to refer North Korea's human rights abuses to the International Criminal Court. It is poised to adopt a similar resolution next month.Marzuki Darusman, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in North Korea, urged the international community to work on ensuring the North's accountability for what the world body called \"crimes against humanity.\"\"This year, another resolution will be tabled because not much change has happened in North Korea since last year. In fact, I don't think any changes have taken place,\" Darusman said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency held on Tuesday in Seoul.Darusman was in Seoul to attend a global conference on the North's human rights records to be held on Wednesday.North Korea has long been branded as one of the worst human rights violators. Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.Darusman said in his recent report to the U.N. that there are widespread human rights abuses in the North such as summary executions and torture.He also said that more than 50,000 North Koreans have been forced to work abroad, mainly in China and Russia as the North seeks to earn hard currency. Pyongyang is under heavy sanctions by the Security Council for its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.The U.N. rapporteur claimed that there is the need to apply the concept of \"universal jurisdiction\" to North Korea's rights abuses.The exercise of universal jurisdiction allows states to investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes against humanity, regardless of where such atrocities are committed or the criminals' nationality.\"It means that any court in the world should be able to address any case that is related to the DPRK with the regard to its human rights violations,\" he said. The DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Darusman said that the move would pave the way for making North Korean perpetrators accountable for such crimes, voicing hope that the U.N. could initiate discussion on the issue.\"Universal jurisdiction will help effectively make the accountability process universal and spread out throughout the world. That means there is no escaping from wrongdoings that have been committed on their people,\" he added.Darusman said he is \"ready\" to visit North Korea if Pyongyang invites him so that he could have a \"deeper understanding\" about the North's situation.In October last year, the North offered to allow him to visit the reclusive country in exchange for dropping the clause on the referral of the North human rights issue to the ICC in the resolution. At that time, he urged the North to invite him unconditionally.He also stressed the need for the South Korean government to increase humanitarian assistance to the impoverished North.\"I think (the provision of) humanitarian aid should be separated from political issues because it is aimed at easing the suffering of people in the DPRK,\" Darusman added.South Korea is seeking to spur civilian inter-Korean exchanges, but the government's aid to the North have been largely small since Seoul imposed sanctions on Pyongyang following the deadly sinking of a warship in 2010.\"It should be disconnected to any immediate political issues,\" the U.N. rapporteur said, adding that South Korea should be at the forefront of extending such assistance to the North.

They have held talks since April 2014, but no significant progress has been made.Park Ok-seon who was forced into forced sexual slavery by Japan`s Imperial Army during World War II watches news on the summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Nov. 2, at a home in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. (Yonhap)Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry said that Lee Sang-deok, director general of Northeast Asian affairs at the ministry, will hold talks with Kimihiro Ishikane, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry\u2019s Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, who recently succeeded his predecessor Junichi Ihara.Since the first round of the talks, Japan has maintained the issue was already settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties. Seoul claims the \u201chumanitarian\u201d issue should be separate from the treaty, and the issue was not on the agenda for the negotiations over the treaty at the time.The leaders of the two neighbors have presented their desire for an early resolution of the issue involving the sex slaves euphemistically called comfort women. There are 47 known surviving Korean victims, who are an average of 89.2 years old.Reiterating that Tokyo\u2019s position over the issue remains unchanged, Abe told a parliamentary budget session that his government would exert efforts to settle the issue.\u201cThere is no change in our stance that (the issue of the comfort women) has legally been settled through the (1965) treaty,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the summit (with Park), the two sides shared the understanding that (the comfort women issue) should not be a hurdle to bilateral efforts to forge a future-oriented relationship. (We also) shared the need to accelerate the negotiations aiming for an early resolution.\u201dDuring a Cabinet meeting, Park renewed her calls for an early settlement of the issue.\u201cDuring the bilateral summit, the two countries agreed to speed up negotiations over the Korean victims. (I) hope (the two sides) will strive to settle this issue at the earliest possible date,\u201d she said.The major bone of contention is Tokyo\u2019s refusal to take legal responsibility for the wartime atrocity. Tokyo has previously taken steps to take \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d such as establishing the civilian Asia Women\u2019s Fund, which Korean victims dismissed as insincere. But it has refused to offer legal reparations and apologies.The two sides have been struggling to gain more concessions from each other based on the three-point \u201cSasae proposal,\u201d which was made by then Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kenichiro Sasae in 2012. The three points were a direct apology by the Japanese prime minister, the Japanese ambassador\u2019s delivery of a letter of apology to the victims and a compensation fund from the Tokyo government.

He refused to share further details about the content of the production.The ministry\u2019s move, however, may find criticism for lacking efficacy despite its severity, according to previous research.A 2011 study by the University of Missouri-Columbia found that using a combination of disturbing images and threatening messages to prevent smoking was not effective. According to the study, those who were exposed to highly disturbing antismoking ads, including both graphic images and messages, in fact had a lower emotional response than those who saw ads that only included either a message or an image.\u201cSimply trying to encourage smokers to quit by exposing them to combined threatening and disgusting visual images is not an effective way to change attitudes and behaviors,\u201d the study said. \u201cEffective communication is more complicated than simply showing a disgusting picture. That kind of communication will usually result in a defensive avoidance response where the smoker will try to avoid the disgusting images, not the cigarettes.\u201dSouth Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, the country had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent. The National Assembly last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking. The new bill took effect on Jan. 1.

Born in 1988 and adopted by a U.S. couple at age 1, Kim arrived in South Korea last year in hopes of finding her birth parents. Kim finally began her search in Korea as an adult, but the process was far from easy. A visit to the Korea Adoption Services, which offers birth family search services for adoptees, was disheartening as officials there told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to see any information about her birth family without their consent. They told her a telegram had been mailed to her mother, and only if she agrees, Kim would be able to meet her in person. Kim is one of many Korean adoptees demanding a revision of the current Special Adoption Law, which they argue prevents them from accessing their records and finding birth families. \u201cFinding our families and knowing our histories shouldn\u2019t depend on accident or luck,\u201d Kim said at a recent forum at the National Assembly in Seoul. Korean adoptees, lawyers and public servants attend a forum discussing the ways to improve the current Special Adoption Law at the National Assembly on Oct. 29. Rep. Choi Dong-ic\u2019s officeIf Kim had not asked for the paper receipt for the telegram, she may have never been able to reunite with her mother. The agency had blackened the recipient\u2019s tracking code on the receipt, but Kim traced it by holding it against a bus window. When Kim finally met her mother by showing up at her place, she realized her mother in fact had been searching for her, too. Her mother had replied to the telegram sent from the KAS asking for further clarification, but got no response from them. The agency had been telling Kim they did not hear back from her mother.Since the KAS was established in 2012 upon the revision of the adoption law, the number of adoptees asking for their personal records to find their birth families has increased dramatically. While 258 adoptees asked to see their information in 2012, 1,654 have done the same this year as of August.In total, 4,790 adoptees requested their records to find their birth parents from 2012-2015, but only 14.7 percent of them were able to reunite with their families, according to data released by New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Lee Jong-kul. Although the law aims to protect children\u2019s rights, the way the KAS interprets some of its articles has made it almost impossible for returning adoptees to see their records, adoptees argued. According to the law, one can access their birth records without their birth parents\u2019 permission only if the birth parent is dead or cannot be found, or the adoptee has a medical condition or other reason for doing so. Jane Jeong Trenka, an adoptee and president of the Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea, said the KAS was applying the clauses too strictly by telling adoptees that they could only receive they personal records if all three criteria are met. \u201cWe believe that this is unreasonable, and this was certainly not our intention,\u201d she said, referring to her organization\u2019s input and support in amending the law three years ago. One of the major changes stipulated by the act was that all children must have a complete birth registration here before being put forward for adoption.\u00a0Because meeting all three criteria at the same time is practically impossible, many adoptees would spend years simply tracing their birth parents.Hanna Johansson, an adoptee in Sweden, has visited Korea six times since 2007 in search of her birth family. The trips have cost her about $15,000, but she has yet to find any relatives.It has been an arduous journey. She began her search from the papers from the Social Welfare Society, the Korean agency that was in charge of her adoption in 1976. The papers said she was an orphan. It was only in 2010 when Johansson discovered that she was found by a police officer in Seoul\u2019s Wangsimni area and was taken to a hospital before being adopted without any records of her birth parents. In 2013, she realized that perhaps the most crucial information had been kept from her -- the name of the police officer who had found her. While the name was included in the file shown to her in 2010 by SWS, it was written in Chinese characters. She learned it was the name of the officer after sharing the documents with Trenka. Johansson was finally able to meet the police officer after sending the KAS about 50 emails.\u201cI think SWS never thought the adoptees would return to search,\u201d Johansson told The Korea Herald. \u201cI think they just do not care if we can get the information or not.\u201d South Korean babies are being sent to the U.S. via plane to be adopted in 1956.YonhapGovernment statistics show that the current system, particularly the process of contacting the birth parents through telegrams instead of text messages or phone calls, is proving ineffective. According to data released by NPAD Rep. Choi Dong-ic, the KAS sent a total of 2,301 telegrams to birth parents between January 2012 and August 2015. Of them, 705 agreed to have their information revealed, while 1,596 did not respond or wished to remain anonymous.Currently, the KAS interprets a non-response from the birth parent as not agreeing to disclose their information. Consequently, 91 percent of 1,391 birth parents who did not give consent for their information to be disclosed from January 2014 until August this year were actually those who never replied.During the forum, Trenka pointed out that there is no way for adoptees to even confirm that these telegrams were even sent, and verify if the right birth parent received them. Trenka and lawyer So Ra-mi also argued that many birth parents would mistake the telegrams as junk mail even if they received them, as some of them simply say \u201ca foreigner is looking to find you,\u201d without informing that the person is an adoptee.South Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers, who are vulnerable to social discrimination and stigmatization here. Woo Hong-sik from the KAS said this is why telegrams are being sent when contacting birth parents, instead of calling or visiting them in person. \u201cBirth mothers who have been remarried (after sending their child overseas for adoption) often keep their past a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cA birth mother may not want their current family to find out that she\u2019s had a child as an unwed woman in the past. Revealing that information could severely affect her relationship with her current family.\u201dHowever, Kang Tae-in, a representative of a group of Korean birth families, said it was untrue that most birth parents don\u2019t want to be found. He said many members of his group have tried to search for their children, only to be insulted and lied to by adoption agencies. One of the members was told, \u201cYou gave up on her. What makes you qualified to search for her now?\u201d when he visited the agency that was in charge of his daughter\u2019s adoption to Denmark. The father was also told that according to Danish laws, birth parents cannot contact their adopted children unless the adoptee contacts them first. However, the father later found out that Denmark has no such laws.Lawyer So Ra-mi said the current system goes against Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stipulates that the child \u201cshall have the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.\u201d For another adoptee, Andrea Kim Cavicchi, locating her birth mother\u2019s burial site involved posting flyers, knocking on the door of every house and visiting three other villages where her mother may have lived, all on her own. She had been reunited with her maternal aunt in 2006 after appearing on a TV show in Korea. Her aunt informed Cavicchi that her mother had passed away, but refused to share any other information.When Cavicchi asked the KAS to persuade her adoption agency, Holt, to hand over her file to help her locate the grave site, the KAS refused, saying she did not have a medical condition, one of the three requirements to access her records. While Cavicchi managed to locate the site without any organizational support, the adoption agency told her to be \u201cgrateful\u201d that she was adopted because she would have been stigmatized for having a single mother who was mentally challenged had she stayed in Korea. She said the most painful part of the search was a deep sense of hopelessness.\u201c(The painful part was) knowing I\u2019ll never find answers to some questions. \u2026 What made my mother laugh? What did her voice sound like? What was her favorite food?\u201d she told The Korea Herald. Cavicchi reached closure when she finally found her mother\u2019s grave site.

Statistics compiled by the Paris-based club of advanced economies show that the average South Korean -- including salaried employees, self-employed and part-timers -- worked 2,124 hours in 2014, up 45 hours from the previous year.\u00a0 This marks 1.2 times, or 354 hours, more than the average for the 34 Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development member countries, which stands at 1,770 hours per year. (Yonhap)Mexico was the only country ahead of Korea with 2,228 hours. South Korea was the most overworked country in the OECD bloc until Mexico knocked it off the top spot in 2008.Germans worked 1,371 hours, the least among the OECD, meaning Koreans work four months longer than Germans per year. Western European and Nordic countries logged less than 1,500 working hours per year, with the Netherlands recording 1,425 hours, Norway 1,427 hours, Denmark 1,436 hours and France 1,473 hours. Japan (1,729 hours), the United States (1,789 hours), Italy (1,734 hours) and the United Kingdom (1,677) hovered around the OECD average, according to the data. South Korea\u2019s working hours had seen a steady decrease from 2,512 hours in 2000 to 2,090 hours in 2011, but the figures have fluctuated since then. The growing number of self-employed workers and the longer hours they put in amid the faltering economy might be linked to last year\u2019s increase for Korea, an expert said.\u201cThe data seems to explain that the self-employed kept their stores open longer as their businesses did not do well,\u201d said Ahn Ju-yeop, a senior researcher from the state-run Korea Labor Institute. The number of self-employed rose from 5.38 million in 2013 to 5.83 million as of this August in the country with a population of 50 million. \u201cThere are also still many salaried workers at manufacturing companies working for more than 60 hours per week and many who do not take their paid vacations,\u201d said Ahn. But the long working hours do not necessarily result in higher labor productivity, the level of output for every hour of work, another expert said.\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s employment structure requires workers to work long hours despite low productivity, as it is more cost-effective for businesses,\u201d Kim Jong-jin, a researcher from the Korea Labor & Society Institute, told The Korea Herald. According to OECD data, South Koreans\u2019 labor productivity was $31.90 per hour in 2014, much lower than the OECD average of $49. It draws a stark comparison with France, where laborers work for 35 hours a week, but with productivity scores of $64 per hour.\u201cBusinesses can save costs such as severance pay and training fees when they make their skilled employees work overtime rather than hire (and) train another staff member,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe environment makes Koreans work longer hours and unable to take paid time off work.\u201d The inefficiency is equally felt among workers themselves, according to a poll last year by the Labor Ministry. In the poll, 37.5 percent of the surveyed 1,300 employees nationwide said their companies\u2019 work efficiency was high enough. While another 37.5 percent of them \u201chardly\u201d worked overtime, only 24.9 percent thought that such a practice helped raise their productivity. \u201cUnless the government fixes the structure through legally binding measures, Koreans will have to work longer hours and the productivity will continue to suffer,\u201d Kim said.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","141":"South Korea's ruling and opposition parties showed mixed responses Monday to the outcome of summit talks between President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\u00a0\u00a0At the first summit between the leaders of the two neighbors in more than three years, Park and Abe agreed to speed up negotiations to resolve the issue of former South Korean sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers.\u00a0\u00a0The ruling Saenuri Party noted it was meaningful that the two countries reached a progressive agreement to elevate relations to the next level.\u00a0\u00a0\"The Saenuri Party praises that the two countries reached the agreement to further improve relations through today's summit,\" the party's spokeswoman Shin Eui-jin said.\u00a0\u00a0She further noted that the two leaders tried to achieve a resolution to the sex slavery issue that has blocked bilateral talks.\u00a0\u00a0But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy criticized the summit agreement, saying there was no new content or substantial achievement.\u00a0\u00a0\"It is very disappointing that no substantial outcome was reached in regards to the historical issue at the S.

Seoul's Defense Minister Han Min-koo said that Washington has made no request to Seoul with regard to the issue as there has been no decision yet within the U.S. government. The Pentagon also said it has made no final decision on the issue, nor has it had any formal consultations with the South.It is not known what was behind Lockheed Martin's flip-flop, including whether Trotsky was truly not familiar with what's going on between the two countries or whether the company wittingly made the mistake in an attempt to promote the issue ahead of the annual defense ministers' talks.Lockheed Martin voluntarily called Thursday's news conference about missile defense at the National Press Club, where correspondents of many foreign countries are stationed. It is without a doubt that questions about THAAD are asked at such events.A similar incident happened in April when a senior Lockheed Martin official told the New York Times days before Carter's trip to Seoul that the company has been providing the U.S. and the South Korean governments with THAAD-related information. South Korea strongly denied the claim.THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is considered one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, and is manufactured by Lockheed Martin.The U.S. wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and has increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a move.Seoul and Washington have claimed they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.

Yonhap\u201cCapitalizing on domestic technology and infrastructure, South Korea will localize key equipment and components. We will develop fighter jets so that we can upgrade their capability by ourselves,\u201d said Chang at a parliamentary meeting. Lee Bum-seok, state-run Agency for Defense Development\u2019s senior researcher for radar technology, echoed the remarks and said that Seoul was capable of developing four of KF-X\u2019s core technologies \u2014 active electronically scanned array radar, infra-red search and track, electronics optics targeting and radio frequency jamming. He said the ADD was also seeking technical cooperation with Britain, Israel and Sweden to minimize risks.The KF-X project hit a snag this year as the U.S. Department of State denied in April export licenses for the four technologies U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin offered for the KF-X project. Washington cited that the transfer would violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations.While the military agency assured that the project could proceed without the intended transfer, critics have slammed the government for hiding the low possibility of the U.S. technology handover from the start, and also resorting to what they called a farfetched plan.In an unusual bipartisan move, the lawmakers of the Defense Committee said that the 18 trillion-won ($15.9 billion) procurement program needed stricter public scrutiny to avoid wasting taxpayers\u2019 money. They also called for a parliamentary inspection into the KF-X program and held high-profile defense officials accountable for the tech transfer failure.Rep. Yoo Seung-min of the ruling Saenuri Party urged the lawmakers to join in passing the motion for the Board of Audit and Inspection to inspect the KF-X program, a move that main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Yoon Hoo-duk supported immediately. Saenuri Rep. Chung Doo-won, the chairman of the committee, repeated his attack against presidential National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin, saying Kim should be held accountable for the project gone awry.On Thursday, Chung said that he had sent a letter to President Park Geun-hye, calling for an overhaul of the faltering KF-X program demanding a public debate on the fighter jet procurement. The parliamentary meeting meanwhile approved the relevant defense budget later in the day.Meanwhile, the Defense Committee on Friday approved 67-billion-won ($58.5 million) 2015 budget for the KF-X project.

The sex ratio indicates the number of boys born for every 100 girls.\u00a0The team chose the period of the early and mid-1990s for their work as the technology for defining the sex of the fetus became available in the country around that time.A regression analysis found that an increase in the boys-to-girls ratio from 105 to 115 would be associated with an increase in women\u2019s time spent on housework by 34 minutes per day during the period.\u00a0For example, in 1990, the wives married into families from North Gyeongsang Province spent 65 minutes more per day on housework, compared to women married to men from Incheon, the research showed. The two regions showed a stark contrast in preference for boys, with the average sex ratio of North Gyeongsang Province being 131 compared to Incheon\u2019s 112.Out of 16 provinces cited in the study, the highest sex ratio at birth was recorded in Daegu followed by North Gyeongsang Province, Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province and Busan.\u00a0\u201cThe research implies that the household gender disparity can only be tackled when husbands change their attitudes towards gender roles as socio-economic conditions for women continues to improve,\u201d the professor said.\u00a0He expected, however, that the gender imbalance in household could have narrowed at a faster pace in the 2000s as the preference for sons in the country has been constantly abating.\u00a0The sex ratio in South Korea reached 116.5 in 1990, but the figure fell to 105.3 in 2014, the lowest ever. The average global sex ratio is between 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\u00a0By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","151":"North Korea's ruling party plans to convene the congress for the first time in more than three decades in early May, Pyongyang's state media said Friday, in what could be the latest move to strengthen leader Kim Jong-un's grip on power.The political bureau of the central committee of Workers' Party of Korea has decided to hold the seventh congress of the party in May, the Korean Central News Agency said, without providing a specific date or agenda.It marks the first party congress since October 1980, as well as the first since Kim took power in late 2011.\"We are faced with the heavy yet sacred task to bring about a great upswing in the building of a thriving socialist nation,\" the party's political bureau said, according to the KCNA.A South Korean official said on condition of anonymity the North's move seems to be aimed at assessing its accomplishments and to set a line of policy.\"The government is closely watching the North's decision. North Korea seemed to make such a decision by taking into account its internal affairs and foreign relations,\" ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said in a regular press briefing.Former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader, advocated a military-first, or \"songun,\" policy by operating the National Defense Commission as the main decision-making body.But the young leader has shifted his focus to the party since inheriting power in 2011 following the sudden death of his father.Kim is pursuing a dual policy of developing nuclear weapons and boosting the country's ailing economy, a policy South Korea and the U.S. have warned is a dead end for the country.The North conducted a massive military parade on Oct. 10 to mark the party's 70th anniversary. Kim delivered a rare public speech ahead of the parade where the North Korean leader showed his care for people.Experts said that the move could herald the full-fledged start of Kim's era amid prospects that the North's leader is likely to unveil his new polices or conduct a major reshuffle, based on his consolidated power.\"Kim is expected to push for an overhaul for the party's leadership and personnel reshuffle at next year's congress,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.\"His grip on power will likely be strengthened further.\"The first party congress was held in August 1946 under the regime of Kim Il-sung, the North's late founder and the current leader's grandfather.North Korea used the WPK's congress as a chance to announce new policy lines, including the five-year plan for economic development in 1956. At the sixth congress in 1980, Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, was confirmed as a successor to the North's founder.North Korea has seen its isolation deepening as it is under heavy sanctions by the U.N. Security Council due to its nuclear and missile tests.On the diplomacy front, North Korea's relations with China have been frayed since the North's nuclear test in early 2013.But the North and its treaty ally China displayed a show of solidarity during the military parade as Liu Yunshan, a top Chinese official, attended it in Pyongyang, standing next to Kim.

(KFS)South Korea and Indonesia vowed stronger cooperation in forest industry and administration, South Korean forest authorities said Thursday.The Korea Forest Service and its Indonesian counterpart held a symposium on wood biomass in the Indonesian city of Jakarta, Wednesday, to share the two countries\u2019 forest policies and know-how. South Korean exporters seeking inroads to Indonesia also participated in the symposium to benchmark successful experiences of their forerunners.The presentation on the KFS\u2019s pilot project on forest biomass and its achievements since 2012 drew large interest from the participants, a KFS official said. The symposium included a debate on the developing methodology of the forest biomass industry, followed by question-and-answer session. The KFS\u2019s pilot project on forest biomass is one of the initiatives in a South Korea-Indonesia memorandum of understanding on the forest biomass energy industry. The MOU was signed in the wake of the South Korea-Indonesia summit of 2009. The test project focuses on the afforestation of Gliricidia, a type of Indonesian tree that is used to produce wood pellets in only two years. Korea and Indonesia intend to plant Gliricidia on a 1,000-hectare tract of land this year, using an advanced short rotation coppice. Wood pellets, or fuel made from biomass or compressed organic matter, has become one of the most widely recognized sources of renewable energy. A ton of this new energy can replace about 524 liters of crude oil and reduce carbon dioxide by about 1.37 tons.The KFS estimates that, starting 2016, the third year of the pilot project, the Gliricidia plantation will yield about 15,000 tons of wood pellets per year -- enough to heat 3,750 households in winter. KFS\u2019s business model developed through the pilot project will be shared with the Indonesian state-run afforestation company and South Korean exporters of forest products. \u201cThe Korea-Indonesia symposium is the fruit of the rising interest in the forest biomass businesses, thanks to the recent enforcement of the mandatory supply of renewable energy,\u201d said Im Ha-soo, an official of the overseas resource development unit of the KFS. \u201cThe KFS will continue to develop policies for a stable supply of overseas forest resources,\u201d he added. The KFS plans to increase Korean investments in Indonesian forest industries by supporting the entrance of Korean private businesses in the sector and the expansion of production facilities of wood pellets in Indonesia.Korea\u2019s forestation investments in Indonesia date back to 1968, when Korea Development Co., a private developer, became the first business enterprise to enter the Indonesian forestation development market.From 1993 to June 2013, a total of 12 Korean firms made inroads in the Indonesian forestation investment market. They developed forests on a total of 194,000 hectares of Indonesian soil. This is equal to 67.5 percent of the domestic forestation investment by Korean companies.

About half of the estimated 129,700 South Koreans on the waiting list for the reunions have died.Since the first inter-Korean summit in 2000, the two Koreas have held 20 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events involving only some 19,800 family members from both sides.

Daffalla El Haj Ali, the director general of the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 bilateral and regional department, reached an agreement with Korea on exchanging ministerial and high-level visits, enhancing mutual support at international forums, ratifying investment protection, preventing double taxation, hosting an economic forum and renewing aid facilities in Sudan. \u201cDespite our geographic distance, Korea is dear in the hearts of all Sudanese,\u201d Ali told The Korea Herald in an interview. \u201cThe 5th consultation was an opportunity to update one another on development and look toward new horizons for future cooperation.\u201d Daffalla El Haj Ali, the director general of the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 bilateral and regional department. Joel Lee \/ The Korea HeraldA career diplomat since 1980, Ali served as a counsellor in Seoul from 1990-92, and opened the embassy before the first ambassador\u2019s arrival. During that time, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the director general of the two Americas at MOFA, and the two diplomats met again in 2010 when Ali was a permanent representative to the U.N., he said. The forum was Seoul\u2019s 14th meeting with an African nation as part of efforts to reach out to the resource-rich continent. This year alone, consultations were held with Equatorial Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Namibia, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Ivory Coast, Seychelles, Zimbabwe, the Republic of Congo and Ghana. Khartoum and Seoul established diplomatic relations in 1977, elevating the consular relations initiated a year before. The director general emphasized that Sudan valued Korea\u2019s development experience with much regard. \u201cWe want a win-win partnership by combining Korea\u2019s capital and technology and Sudan\u2019s untapped resources in agriculture, minerals and livestock.\u201dFor foreign investors, three economic zones \u2015 the Sudanese Free Zones, the Red Sea Free Zones and Al Gaili Free Zones \u2015 operate near Port Sudan along the Red Sea.\u201cSudan is the gateway to Africa and bridgehead to the Middle East,\u201d he stressed, adding that foreign capital could eye domestic, regional and continental markets.\u00a0 Daffalla El Haj Ali, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 director general of bilateral and regional department (center) and Sudanese Ambassador to Korea Mohamed Abdelaal (third from right) pose with Sudanese diplomats at the embassy in Seoul on Tuesday.

Ali pointed to the ongoing construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which came out of intense negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. \u201cThe project initially raised concerns from Egypt with regard to control over regional power,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as a geostrategic player in the Horn of Africa, we played the role of an honest broker.\u201dThe water will be shared and the entire scheme will contribute to regional sustainable development, further establishing peace, stability and prosperity, according to the diplomat.Regarding the country\u2019s relations with its southern neighbor South Sudan, which gained independence on July 9, 2011, after six decades of civil war, he said his government was working with the Intergovernmental Authority for Development to resolve issues left by the comprehensive peace agreement, principally demarcating borders and eliminating rebel groups.

The patient was recovering from the aftereffects of MERS after testing negative earlier. The 152nd patient received a lung transplant after suffering from MERS but failed to recover fully. Following the latest death, the fatality rate of the disease in Korea rose from 19.4 percent to 19.9 percent.The CDC said that the five super-spreaders, all of whom had pneumonia, transmitted the virus to 153 of the 184 patients detected between May 20, 2015, and July 13, 2015. Two of the total 186 infected patients have been excluded from the denominator as their transmission routes remain uncertain, the CDC said. Thirty-five-year-old patient No. 14, for instance, spread the virus to 85 people while staying at Samsung Medical Center, showing the strongest contagiousness observed from the crisis, the CDC said in its report. Officials take the temperature of hospital-goers at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul on Oct. 13 after one of the patients recovered from MERS was diagnosed again. YonhapThe CDC published these and other epidemiological results on Korea\u2019s MERS outbreak on the Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives journal. This is the CDC\u2019s first such report on the MERS outbreak here.The CDC said it has defined those as super-spreaders if the patient had transmitted the virus to at least four people.The median age of the super-spreaders was 41 years and they all contacted hundreds of people while staying at their respective medical facilities. Four of them were men. Patients 1, 14 and 16 had severe coughs and infected 28 people, 85 people, and 23 people, respectively. On the other hand, Patient 15 and patient 76, who rarely coughed, infected six people and 11 people, respectively, the report said.These patients were hospitalized for an average of 10 days, and the number of people who came into close contact with them ranged from 288 to 805. While patient No. 14 wore a mask intermittently, other super-spreaders did not wear one. None received aerosol-generating treatment.Of the 186 patients infected across 16 hospitals, some 44.1 percent of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8 percent were caregivers, and 13.4 percent were health care personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days.The report said the respiratory droplet route is seen as the most likely method of transmission but that further survey is currently ongoing.The report also confirmed failed preventive measures in the early stage.The patient No. 1 started developing fever and myalgia on May 11 after returning from a business trip to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. His diagnosis did not come until May 20, partly due to a failure of him telling medical staff the countries he had traveled to in his first several hospital visits. By then, he had already come into contact with over 600 people during his multiple visits to different hospitals. Twenty-six cases of infection were confirmed among these initial contacts, and consecutive transmission via hospitals rapidly proceeded throughout the nation, the report explained. Even upon the first diagnosis, only three were placed in isolation. The number then increased to 64 the next day and to 120 upon the diagnosis of the fifth patient. Those who were not placed in isolation soon enough further transmitted the virus at other hospitals, some of them becoming super-spreaders.The analysis showed that the mortality rate of those aged 65 and over was almost eight times higher than that of younger patients.History of diabetes, malignancy and the presence of underlying respiratory disease, cardiac disease and chronic kidney disease were also significantly associated with mortality. MERS is a viral disease that is still fairly new to humans. No vaccine or treatment is currently available for the disease, which contributes the high fatality rate of around 36 percent globally.There currently is only one MERS patient in South Korea. Thirty-five-year-old patient No. 80 tested negative for the virus on Sept. 30 and again on Oct. 1 but tested positive recently.From news reports","167":"President Park Geun-hye has appointed a former journalist as her new spokesperson in a personnel reshuffling carried out to boost efficiency of state affairs management, Cheong Wa Dae said Sunday.Jeong Yeon-guk resigned as a department head of MBC, a terrestrial network, to take up the new post, which has been vacant for 20 days since the previous spokesperson, Min Kyung-wook, left to run in next year's general elections, the presidential office said.The former TV reporter most recently headed the department managing current affairs programs and hosted the popular MBC program \"100 Minute Debate.\"\"I don't know much, but I'll try to learn things as quickly as I can,\" he told reporters after the announcement.On Sunday, Park also named Yook Dong-in, a spokesman for the Financial Services Commission, as the new head of Cheong Wa Dae's press center.

Last week, the U.S. defense chief rejected the request for reconsideration of the U.S. decision by his South Korean counterpart. (Yonhap)","171":"South Korea will be forced some day to choose between the United States and China despite its efforts to balance between the global giants, a renowned American pundit said Friday amid controversy over U.S. President Barack Obama's remarks on Seoul-Beijing ties.After summit talks with President Park Geun-hye in Washington last week, Obama stated the U.S. expects South Korea to speak out against China if it fails to abide by international norms and rules.Obama's message was viewed as thinly-veiled pressure on Seoul to join Washington in criticizing Beijing for its growing territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea.In the end, South Korea will face a \"painful decision\" to pick one of the two, according to John Mearsheimer, professor of political science at the University of Chicago.\"The security competition in East Asia is going to increase in intensity over time. (South) Koreans are going be forced to choose at some point. That's what's going to happen,\" he said at a forum on South Korea's diplomacy hosted by the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.In that case, he added, Seoul is bound to select Washington, as security considerations \"always trump\" economic considerations.\"Therefore, Korea's relationship with the United States will ultimately be more important than Korea's relationship with China,\" said Mearsheimer, who doubles as co-director of the program on international security policy at the school.He said the rivalry between the U.S. and China over hegemony especially in Asia will continue to heat up and even risk a war.\"China will try to dominate Asia the way the United States dominates the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. is likely to go to greater length to prevent China from dominating Asia,\" the professor stressed.He was skeptical that the two Koreas will achieve reunification in the foreseeable future, citing China's negative view.\"North Korea is an important strategic asset for China. There is no way that China is going to allow unification under the South Korean auspices,\" he said.In fact, a majority of South Koreans see China as not only a key player in a reunification process but also a major obstacle, showed recent opinion polls.Speaking after Mearsheimer, a Chinese scholar refuted the view.Wang Jisi, president of the Institute of the International and Strategic Studies at Peking University. said China is \"not a dominant factor\" in Korea's unification, adding the two Koreas hold the key.\"The stability of the DPRK (North Korea) is in our best interests,\" he said in English, adding China believes the U.S. is also to blame for tensions in the region.\"Owing to China's increased distrust of U.S. intentions in the region, it sees the tensions on the Korean Peninsula as caused by both Pyongyang and Washington,\" he said. \"The Chinese expect Seoul to be more 'neutral' between the U.S. and China. The U.S. also has to accommodate the rise of China.\"Above all, China does not want the U.S. to interfere with other countries' affairs, he stressed.In his opening speech at the conference, South Korea's top diplomat agreed that diplomatic challenges facing South Korea include seeking sustainable peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia.\"Certainly, bilateral relations between regional countries are the primary factor in this mission. Above all, U.S.-China relations are a crucial factor,\" Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said.He reiterated that Seoul's relations with Washington and Beijing are not a \"zero-sum\" game.\"Here, we can see elements of both competition and cooperation, so it is critical that we do not fall into the trap of a zero-sum or preordained mindset,\" he said.With the title \"Opening the next chapter: where Korean diplomacy stands,\" the event marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and Korea's liberation from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.

Schools choose from any of the eight textbooks, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.After months of controversy, the Ministry of Education last week announced that history textbooks nationwide will be authored by the government starting in the 2017 school year. \"The problematic thing about the current system is that most of the authors participating in authoring and monitoring the textbooks are mostly left-leaning,\" said Cho Jin-hyung, the chief of the group.Cho said as for Rhee Syng-man, the first South Korean president, most textbooks described him as a leader who had many flaws rather than feats.\"There were mostly negative contents about the Rhee Syng-man administration,\" Cho said, adding that books should have a balanced view of him as the leader in the chaotic period following Korea's liberation from Japan's\u00a0 1910-45 colonial rule.Another non-profit education civic group, World Without Worries About Shadow Education raised concern that the government's decision to reintroduce a single set of textbooks could raise the cost of private education.\"It is difficult to conclude that a single set of textbooks directly raises the cost of private education,\" said Yoon Jee-hee.\"However, there is a high possibility that the burden on private education will be increased in light of the local education culture, which emphasizes private tutoring.\" South Korean parents are known for their enthusiasm about education, with private education spending staying significantly high, though its growth has been slowing in recent years. Parents spent 18.2 trillion won ($17 billion) in 2014 on private education for their children, according to data released by the non-profit education civic group.Private education spending reached its peak in 2009 at 21 trillion won.

But the event has suggested there is a connection between basic science and the creative economy,\" Kwon said. \"It showed that basic science can contribute to the local economy.\"During the event, representatives of the OECD and ASEAN members shared ideas on the role of science in overcoming common global issues, with South Korea promoting the creative economy policy as a solution to achieve the vision.The creative economy calls for generating new growth opportunities through merging different industries, especially through science technology.The city added it will provide foreign investors with business support, including tax cuts, and continue opening various events to promote Daejeon overseas.It will also continue fostering the Daejeon-led World Technopolis Association, which brings together different cities with a similar nature around the globe to promote science development.\"It marked the first time for the OECD science ministerial meeting to be held outside Paris.

The academy demanded official medical records, but Lee shot back that such attempts amounted to defamation of Chun's character.The academy, however, didn't process Lee's request for a withdrawal of Chun's membership. Chun remains listed as a member of the academy on its website.Chun left for New York in 1998 after donating 93 paintings to the Seoul Museum of Art.

The current city administration has strived to change the public perception toward bicycles in order to promote it as a basic means of public daily life.As part of the efforts to boost bike use, the city has in recent years constructed bike-only roads spanning 180 kilometers between the five Ddaleungee service locations as well as a 70-kilometer stretch along the Hangang River for leisure purposes. As of this year, 724 kilometers of bike-only roads are installed in the capital, officials said. Along with the bike-friendly infrastructure, the city government has put efforts into improving public perceptions toward the bike through various measures. It has run free bike schools for bike beginners and provided bike safety classes for children at schools while holding various bike-related festivals and events across the city. Some city districts also offer free insurance packages for bike riders. \u201cThe mayor has considered raising public perception as important as constructing enough bike infrastructure,\u201d a city official told The Korea Herald. Running a public bike-sharing service has long been a staple green project in metropolitan cities around the world, with about 530 municipalities having launched such projects. In Paris, about 24,000 bikes are running in the city\u2019s program, attracting more than 286,000 annual subscriptions since 2007. This is equivalent to 1 in 8 Parisians.New York\u2019s Citi Bike, the largest public bike share in the U.S., has drawn over 90,000 subscribers with 6,000 bikes across the city since 2013. The average day last year saw about 34,000 rides. The city is planning to increase the number of both bikes and docking stations by 2017. While other cities have successfully led public bike sharing systems, questions linger over Seoul City\u2019s scheme as a similar attempt in the past resulted in a disappointing outcome.In 2010, the former Seoul City government led by Oh Se-hoon ran a bike project with 440 public bikes in Yeouido and Sangam. Facing the high cost and low public participation, however, the city soon scrapped it.Expensive and heavy bikes posed challenges to the city as one bike, weighing 23 kilograms, cost 6.4 million won. In order to lower the cost, the current city government led by Park Won-soon halved the bike cost by recycling and reassembling the existing bikes with lighter components. It also eliminated the kiosks that were installed at docking stations for bike rental and instead introduced an online and mobile kiosk application service to save money. Installing one kiosk used to cost 20 million won, adding to the financial burden, officials said. \u201cWhile the system is much improved, it\u2019s still uncertain how the public will respond to the new scheme. It\u2019s optimistic, however, that the city at least attempted to \u2018invite\u2019 the public to ride bikes in downtown Seoul,\u201d said urban planning and design professor Jeong Seok at University of Seoul. \u201cThe use of transportation means depends on the public psychology. Making that very first attempt of riding a bike along the roads for cars may be challenging as bikers are the minority among the traffic. But they may gradually rise to become a major part of the traffic once the number of bike riders increases, consequently influencing the transportation measures.\u201d In order to successfully run Ddaleungee, civic groups stress that raising public awareness is crucial. \u201cCar drivers must acknowledge first that the roads are made for both automobiles and bikes. Some prevalent misperceptions that roads are only for car owners often leads to bike accidents on roads, stirring safety concerns for cyclists,\u201d said civic group Green Transport manager Ko Moon-soo, who is in charge of bike issues. The current transportation rule legally allows bike riders to use one-third of the right-most lane of the road, but many car drivers are not aware of the regulation, he added. According to Rep. Byun Jae-ill of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the bike accident rate surged to some 4,100 cases in the capital last year, up 70 percent from 2010. This has led to 37 deaths and over 4,200 injured riders. Of these cases, collisions with cars accounted for the most with 81 percent, followed by those with pedestrians with 10 percent, and accidents with other bikes at 8 percent.

SHARE a vision that science, technology and innovation: - improve the quality of life for all our citizens as they increase employment, productivity and economic growth in a sustainable manner over the long term; - provide new opportunities for investment, both for start-ups and established firms, in developed and developing countries; and, - are essential to meeting global and societal challenges, such as environmental sustainability, climate change, developing new sources of energy, food security and healthy ageing, hence achieving the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations. Moreover, science enlarges our understanding of Nature and society: science advances thanks to the curiosity and creativity of researchers which needs to be encouraged. AGREE that science, technology and innovation are being revolutionised by the rapid evolution of digital technologies, which are changing the way scientists work, collaborate and publish; increasing the reliance on access to scientific data and publications (\"open science\"); opening new avenues for public engagement and participation in science and innovation (\"citizen science\"); facilitating the development of research co-operation between businesses and the public sector; contributing to the transformation of how innovation occurs (\"open innovation\"). RECOGNISE that an array of new production technologies heralding the \"next production revolution\" is potentially transformative for our economies and can support sustainable growth and well-being. ACKNOWLEDGE that innovation is essential to address new health challenges that arise from ageing (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases), globalisation (possibly facilitating pandemics) and rapidly shifting income and dietary patterns: Advanced health technologies and approaches, such as genomics and precision medicine, will offer promising contributions for responding to these and other health challenges.AGREE that science, technology and innovation have become more global, with emerging countries becoming major actors and many issues reaching global scale, like climate change, food security, neglected diseases, global health issues (e.g. dementia) and pandemics (as illustrated in the recent Ebola outbreak).RECOGNISE that science is increasingly important to inform policies and decision making across a broad range of areas, from long-term environmental and public welfare issues to emergency disease outbreaks and natural disasters. RECOGNISE the unique role of the OECD as an international forum for science, technology and innovation policy analysis and for peer learning among governments.ACKNOWLEDGE the importance of the OECD\u2019s enhanced multi-stakeholder approach that directly involves the key societal actors in science, technology and innovation, from university associations to business representatives, while collaborating actively with relevant international and regional organisations.DECLARE that our countries need policies that promote excellence and relevance in public research and encourage stronger links between academia, industry and society in order to strengthen the impact of science and technology. To that effect:a) Basic and applied research need adequate long-term funding, even in a context of budgetary constraint.b) A market-friendly, competitive environment is required for businesses to invest in research and innovation, and for entrepreneurship to flourish.c) The innovation capacity of the public sector needs to be strengthened, as it is a major source of economic activity in itself.d) The education and training systems should nurture talent and supply the workforce with the broad range of skills required for generating and using innovations.e) Monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened, making full use of opportunities raised by information technology and new sources of data. The results of measurement and evaluation should be used in subsequent policy development and appropriate steps should be taken to make evaluation data accessible for analysis.f) Public understanding of science, as well as public engagement and trust in key science and technology institutions, are necessary for society to fully exploit the opportunities created by innovation.g) Policies are needed that support the positive transformational impact of digital technologies on research and innovation (and limit any anticipated risks), so as to promote \"open science\".h) The policy frameworks need to be strengthened to enable the next production revolution and maximise its positive impact on productivity and areas such as health and the environment.i) The scientific and technological advances required to address new health challenges would be facilitated by collaboration among governments, academia, patients, and industry throughout the R&D; and regulatory processes (for instance through data sharing, citizen science, crowdsourcing, virtual platforms for encouraging peer-to-peer networks and other collaborative research).j) Greater international co-operation is critical for addressing global challenges, but new co-ordination, funding and governance mechanisms are also required, notably to better exploit open science, invest in global research infrastructures and accelerate collective responses to crises.k) The governance of international science and technology co-operation should be made more inclusive vis-a-vis developing and emerging economies; the innovation capacities of these countries should be strengthened, they should be more involved in agenda and priority setting for research co-operation, as well as have a stronger role in global policy coordination and rule setting.ENCOURAGE the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, as well as other global efforts for sustainability, to take into consideration the critical roles of science, technology and innovation in explaining and responding to climate change.WELCOME the 2015 update of the OECD Innovation Strategy, which provides a highly valuable framework for designing, orienting and implementing national innovation strategies and addressing international issues of common interest relating to science, technology and innovation.REQUEST that the OECD, going forward, continue advising on the future development of science, technology and innovation policies, notably as regards: i) building scientific excellence and increasing the impact of public research, ii) strengthening the contribution of science, technology and innovation to sustainable economic growth, a cleaner environment and a more inclusive society; and iii) improving international co-ordination in science and technology.INVITE the OECD to:a) Support the improvement of policies for \"open science\", notably by:i) continuing to explore key policy actions to promote open access to the results of publicly funded research, and to investigate ways to develop internationally coordinated approaches to data and information infrastructures;ii) assessing the need for revising the Recommendation of the Council concerning Access to Research Data from Public Funding, and identifying common principles for the development of open science and big data (in conjunction with parallel efforts addressing the broader issue of data access on the Internet);iii) working with key actors to bring the lessons learned from information- and data-sharing initiatives led by the scientific community to the attention of policy makers and bring policy lessons to the attention of the scientific community.b) Continue to develop methods and indicators for assessing the impact of research and innovation policies, notably by:i) preparing analyses of policies and their impact across countries;ii) facilitating the exchange of good practices on impact assessment;iii) conducting co-ordinated impact assessments of comparable policies across countries when appropriate.c) Continue improving statistics and measurement systems to better capture the key features of science, technology and innovation, including by ensuring a successful 2016 OECD Blue Sky conference on the Future of STI Indicators, which can make a major contribution to this goal.d) Explore the innovation policy frameworks needed for sustainable development and the \"next production revolution\", specifically by:i) analysing the expected economic, social and environmental impact of emerging technologies including the impact on productivity and inclusive growth;ii) examining the innovation policy issues raised by environmental challenges;iii) developing better evidence on the effectiveness of specific policy instruments (e.g. prizes) that could advance technologies for sustainable development, as well as better evidence on the coordinated use of these instruments (\"systems innovation\");iv) assessing the policies needed to accelerate development of a bio-based economy, including the design of guidelines for measuring the sustainability of biomass production and utilisation, while exploring the associated ethical, social and political implications;v) analysing the role of research and innovation in the sustainable development of the ocean economy.e) Investigate how best to support basic research in the health area and its translation into applications, notably with regards to omics technologies and precision medicine; identify innovative approaches to foster co-operation between the various stakeholders involved in research and development; and examine effective ways to integrate ethics and societal values into the evolution and governance of health technologies.f) Explore new measures to implement effective cross-border co-operation in science and technology, particularly by:i) identifying best-practice mechanisms to improve the coherence and coordination of national research agendas across countries.

For all of 2014, South Korea exported $10.1 billion in goods to Russia.\"South Korean negotiators, in particular, will take issue with Moscow's decision to change tariff rules on refrigerators, the recent increase in products being checked by customs, and a rise in certification costs,\" it said.Besides trade, the government will express its wish to promote closer ties with the Eurasian Economic Union. The economic union launch in January was created by Russia and includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan as member states.The two sides will also discuss ways to merge Russia's know-how in basic sciences with South Korea's commercial production prowess in such areas as cars and shipbuilding.Seoul and Moscow have been holding working-level industrial cooperation talks since 1999. (Yonhap)","183":"The Korean version of the book on Chinese leader Xi Jinping's governing philosophy has been released, its publishing company said Wednesday.The compilation of the Chinese leader's major works between November 2012 and June 2014, titled \"Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,\" contains a total of 79 speeches, talks and interviews.It also showcases photos taken at different stages of his life, providing readers with a glimpse into his personal life.The book first published last year has been translated into English, French, Japanese and Russian, among others, and has been sold in some 100 countries worldwide, with its distribution exceeding 5.2 million, according to the Korean publisher, Marae-N.\"The book vividly presents China's earnest will for co-prosperity with the international community and efforts for the happiness of the people in the world, as well as the country's status as a responsible big power,\" said Tuo Zhen, the deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, during a forum marking the publication held in Seoul earlier in the day.\u00a0 Pointing to similarities between the two countries in geographic, economical and liberal arts terms, he said bilateral relations are \"in their best season ever.\"Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Qiu Guohong who attended the forum noted that the book \"will be key for the people here to better understand China. It will also tell where China is from and what path it will take down the road, as well as the influence of China's development on Korea and the whole world.\" (Yonhap)","184":"The United States has seen no signs of North Korea planning a nuclear test, Washington's chief nuclear negotiator said Tuesday.Amb. Sung Kim, special representative for North Korea policy, made the remark after South Korea's main intelligence agency reported to lawmakers earlier in the day that the North is preparing for its fourth nuclear test, although a test is not imminent.\"I have seen nothing to indicate that a test is being planned.We are monitoring closely, as I said,\" Kim told reporters after a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.\"North Korea should not be conducting any nuclear test for in fact they should not be conducting any nuclear activity. Multiple UN Security Council resolutions prohibit them from carrying out nuclear activities. I certainly hope that they are not planning to conduct another nuclear test,\" he said.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North put a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 warheads by 2020. (Yonhap)","185":"An international forum on museums will be held in an eastern county in South Korea next week to explore social roles museums can play, its organizer said Tuesday.The Yeongwol International Museum Forum will take place in the county of the same name in Gangwon Province for a three-day run starting Oct. 28, according to the Korean Museum Association.Under the theme of \"the national policy and role of museums in society,\" dozens of participants from 34 countries, including Japan, China, the United States and France, will exchange views in five relevant categories of policy on managing museums, public support, promotion, regional development and a session reserved for students. \"It will be a venue of active presentations and discussions on a variety of examples and experiences on museums in the world,\"chief of its organizing committee Ji Geon-kil said. \"It will help draw up a blueprint for what roles museums can play in the future for the harmonized development of a region, the culture and the tourism industry.\"With a goal to shed its image as a remote and moribund county, the mining town of Yeongwol opted in 2005 to be \"the city of museums\" and built 26 museums and galleries, transforming itself into a popular tourist destination, bringing 1.5 million visitors per year. (Yonhap)","186":"The results of scientific research and big data should be more accessible to people at all levels to accelerate the development of science and technology, two world leading scientists said Tuesday.A staunch advocate of the so-called open science, Sergio Bertolucci, the research and computing director at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, said what scientists discover is not under their sole possession but is for everyone.Touchscreens and the World Wide Web are some of the examples that were first invented for research purposes at CERN but later shared with the public, Bertolucci said in a lecture during a global science meeting in Daejeon.Citing his experience in astronomy, Phil Diamond, director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, also said open science, a collaborative way of doing research, leads to improved results.\"I find it unfortunate that in some areas of science, openness is not so common. I think science suffers as a result,\" he said.\u00a0 Diamond said governments should take part in establishing infrastructure to let scientists cope with the enormous volumes of data and bringing in young people to the industry.\"Above all, we need people. We need young people, the new talents coming forward to develop the techniques to process this data,\" Diamond said. The scientists are here to attend the OECD Ministerial Meeting Daejeon 2015, World Science & Technology Forum that runs from Monday through Friday in Daejeon, a city packed with science institutes located 164 kilometers south of Seoul. (Yonhap)","187":"The ongoing meeting of global science ministers in South Korea will likely serve as a great opportunity to promote the country's achievements in technology to the world, Seoul's science minister said Tuesday.A meeting of science ministers from members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development kicked off in Daejeon, some 164 kilometers south of Seoul, earlier in the day, to seek ways to promote sustainable economic growth and pursue solutions to global challenges.\u00a0\u00a0 The two-day OECD Ministerial Meeting Daejeon 2015 brings together some 270 representatives from 57 countries and 12 international organizations, including science ministers from the nations. Delegates from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are also participating.\"I think the hosting of the OECD meeting will help beef up South Korea's presence in science diplomacy,\" ICT Minister Choi Yang-hee said. \"The OECD also acknowledges South Korea's efforts and accomplishments, and hopes the development model will be shared with underdeveloped nations.\" Choi said South Korea has also agreed with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations members to bolster ties to share the vision.South Korea invited not only the OECD members but the ASEAN members to the round table as well, in line with the rising need to narrow technology gaps among countries with different economic development levels. Choi said South Korea also wishes to forge deeper ties with neighboring countries like China and Japan.\"Although there has not been significant progress in cooperation with Japan over the past years, I plan to visit Japan this year and achieve some things,\" said Choi, who chairs the OECD meeting. (Yonhap)","188":"Hundreds of South Koreans arrived at a North Korean mountain resort Tuesday for meetings with their relatives separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The 389 members of 96 families were to meet with a total of 141 North Koreans on Mount Kumgang along the communist nation's east coast.It marks the first inter-Korean family reunions event since February 2014, a fruit of the Aug. 25 deal between the two Koreas on ending a military standoff.The South Koreans, mostly elderly, will stay here through Thursday for a series of six reunions that will last a total of 12 hours.Earlier in the day, the South Koreans crossed the heavily fortified border on 16 buses. Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo saw them off at a condo in Sokcho, Gangwon Province.They include 97-year-old Kwon Oh-hee, who will meet his 80-year-old step son Ri Han-sik.Two women -- Yeom Ji-rye, 88, and Kim Sun-tak, 77 -- headed to the North in ambulances due to their illnesses, which have failed to stop them from meeting their long-lost family members living in the North.North Korean border guards closely checked the belongings of South Korean visitors, including the laptops of South Korean reporters, during the customs and quarantine procedures that took about one hour.Another round of reunions involving 250 other South Koreans of 90 families will be held from Saturday to next Monday at the resort developed by the South's Hyundai Group.Nearly 130,000 South Koreans are registered in the government's data system as having families in the North. Half of them have already died, with around 66,000 separated family members on the waiting list.\u00a0 Since the first inter-Korean summit in 2000, the two Koreas have held 19 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events. There were seven rounds of video-based reunions.

If you get 'A' all the time in school, it means you go straight forward. And if there is something new (at the end), you always fail,\" Ciechanover said.Ciechanover added South Korean students also must not fear open discussion with teachers, much like Israel.\"You learn from failure if you can correct it. It is not a shame to fail. In order to succeed, you must fail,\" he said, adding that South Korean parents must keep this in mind when teaching their children. (Yonhap)","191":"Gen. Lee Sun-jin, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, inspected combat readiness at a frontline military outpost facing North Korea Monday and instructed servicemen to react harshly against any North Korean provocations.During the visit to the military guard post along the central part of the border, Lee was briefed on the latest situation with the North Korean military and examined the combat posture of South Korea servicemen, the JCS said in a statement.North Korea could launch a provocation at an unlikely place in an unexpected way, such as the South Korean soldiers injured in a land mine explosion in August, the general stressed, ordering troops to hit back mercilessly against any provocations.\"If the enemy provokes, retaliate resolutely, without hesitation so the day will be remembered as humiliation,\" the JCS chief said. He also ordered the servicemen to stand ready to fight any time, pledging to support their combat with combined forces from the U.S. It is Lee's second visit to a frontline military unit in two weeks.Two days after taking office on Oct. 7, the new JCS chief visited the frontline island of Yeonpyeong in the Yellow Sea and warned North Korea to not carry out military provocations. The three military branches --Army, Navy and Air Force -- and the marine forces\u00a0 launched an annual joint field training exercise earlier in the day for a two-week run. This year's Hoguk joint exercise will focus on keeping military readiness posture in line with evolving security and operational environments and includes anti-special forces drills, defense drills on front-line islands, and anti-air drills, before wrapping up on Oct. 30, the JCS said. (Yonhap)","192":"Renowned U.S. futurist Jeremy Rifkin said Monday he is negative about the future of car-sharing service Uber but remains optimistic about the home-sharing website Airbnb, citing their different approaches to the sharing economy.Rifkin's remarks are in line with his vision on the sharing economy, which calls for the importance of sharing possessions among members of communities rather than struggling to claim ownership.\"I think Uber is not going to make it,\" Rifkin told Yonhap News Agency on the sidelines of a global science gathering underway in this central South Korean city.\"Of course, Uber has been very successful on the Internet of Things platform, designed to be distributed, collaborative, open and transparent. But then, huge amounts of money are from Goldman Sachs and Google.\"\"The finance is from giant, global and vertically integrated capitalist companies that will try to control every owner of a car in the world,\" Rifkin said. \"The reason it won't work, I am beginning to see drivers are saying, 'What do we need Uber for?'\"According to Rifkin, Uber's system can be worked into the market without the interference of global capital.\"Anyone can set up a GPS website. Now drivers are saying, why don't we just set up a cooperative,\" Rifkin said, adding the cooperative system can suggest a new guideline to the global capitalism. \"A cooperative can do it cheaper.\"\"Regional cooperatives are getting together, and the profit does not have to go to a third party,\" he said, adding that Uber's system is not a unique one developed by a specific firm, but an idea that has existed for a long time.\"I think cooperatives are not a part of the global capitalists' market.

The world's second-largest economy has been struggling with falling exports amid weaker global demand and a lackluster property market at home. The third-quarter figure, released by China's National Bureau of Statistics, was lower than the second quarter's 7 percent growth and dimmed prospects about China's 2015 growth target of \"around 7 percent.\" This year, China's communist government has introduced a series of measures to shore up the falling economy, including cutting interest rates and reducing the value of the yuan.\"In the first three quarters of 2015, as the recovery of the world economy was weaker than expected, China was facing increasing downward pressure of domestic economic development,\" the Chinese statistics bureau said in a statement. Despite the Chinese economy weakening faster than expected, the Chinese statistics bureau said the economic growth is still \"within the proper range.\" \"As a whole, the good momentum of steady growth did not change in spite of the slight slowdown in the third quarter of 2015,\" it said. \"The national economy was still running within the proper range, structural adjustments were accelerating, and new momentum was building. \"However, we must be aware that internal and external conditions are complicated and downward pressure for economic development still exists,\" it said.Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for China's economy to 6.8 percent this year and 6.3 percent next year.\u00a0 China is trying to transform its export-oriented economy into a consumption-led one. A state-run Chinese newspaper reported on Monday that Chinese economists proposed a target of 6.5 percent growth starting in 2016 for five years as part of economic transformation efforts.The idea of slower economic growth is being discussed ahead of an annual meeting of top leaders later this month, the paper reported. \"Some economists even see short periods of 6 percent growth as tolerable,\" the report said.

He held meetings with Korean diplomatic, political, business and civil communities during his four-day stay. Elected as the 11th head of state in March 2012, Gauck, 75, was formerly a Lutheran pastor and civil rights activist in communist East Germany. After the two states were reunited, he served as the first Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records at the Bundestag from 1990 to 2000, and a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism along with former Czech President Vaclav Havel and other statesmen.Many consider Gauck to have played a constructive role in addressing the baggage of the communist era and bridging the national schism.

While Korean women\u2019s smoking prevalence rates are quite low compared to other developed nations, research findings show that the rates may rise in the future if young women in their 20s as well as female teenagers continue to smoke as they grow older, according to the government report.As of last year, only 4.3 percent of all Korean women aged 15 or older smoked, which was far lower than the average smoking prevalence rate for women in the Organization for Economic and Development countries, which stood at 15.7 percent. The rate in France was 20.2 percent, while that of Japan was 8.2 percent. 123RFHowever, the smoking prevalence rate for Korean female teenagers, which stood at 5.7 percent, was higher than those for all age groups except women in their 20s and 30s.Overseas studies have shown that women\u2019s empowerment is associated with increasing women\u2019s smoking prevalence rates, especially among young women. The World Health Organization\u2019s 2010 report found that in countries where women have higher empowerment, women\u2019s smoking rates were higher than men\u2019s, independent of the level of economic development and of the level of income inequality. Data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey also showed that smoking rates among boys and girls worldwide resemble each other more than smoking rates among adult women and men, partly because societies are becoming increasingly tolerant of women who smoke worldwide.The WHO report also stated that the rise of smoking among women has been affected by the tobacco industry\u2019s marketing of cigarettes to women as a \u201csymbol of emancipation.\u201dRegardless, medical experts stressed that cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causes many diseases and reduces the health of smokers in general, regardless of one\u2019s gender. For women, smoking is estimated to increase the risk of developing lung cancer by 26.7 times, and quadruples their risk of having an ectopic pregnancy. In spite of its low female smoking rate, Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, it had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among OECD nations at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent.While the largest number of female Korean smokers are in their 20s and 30s, the biggest number of male smokers were in their 30s and 40s, as of last year. The parliament last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking. The new bill took effect on Jan.1.Local health experts stress that it is important to make efforts to curb youth smoking rates on the connection with other issues, as studies have shown the number of teens who both drink and smoke is 6.4 times higher than those who drink but don\u2019t smoke. Smoking teenagers are also 1.9 times more likely to be depressed and 1.4 times more likely to skip breakfast than nonsmoking teens.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","197":"In 2012, South Korea\u2019s public broadcaster MBC sparked outrage among international viewers when it aired a segment of two Korean female comedians in blackface on its comedy show \u201cThree Wheels.\u201dThe show received mounting criticism, mostly from overseas viewers, who claimed the particular scene was blatantly racist. The producer of the show eventually offered a public apology, explaining the two women were simply parodying Michol -- a black male character featured in Korea\u2019s hugely popular 1987 TV animated series \u201cDooly the Little Dinosaur.\u201d Regardless of the intention, many critics argued the scene was undoubtedly insensitive and discriminatory against blacks. While appearing in blackface, the two comedians sang \u201cShintoburi,\u201d a 1999 Korean pop song that praises Korean heritage and culture, specifically mentioning kimchi and soybean paste. \u201cI did not think it was funny. What were they thinking?\u201d an international viewer said in a YouTube video she posted to criticize the show.\u00a0 A much-criticized scene from MBC\u2019s \u201cThree Wheels,\u201d where two female comedians appeared in blackface in 2012. (Screen capture from MBC)Some three years have passed since then, but just last week nine Korean broadcasters -- including terrestrial MBC, KBS and SBS -- agreed to not use language that is discriminatory in all their programs, especially toward women and racial or ethnic minorities. Upon the agreement, the Korea Communication Standards Commission released the nation\u2019s first language use guidelines for all broadcasters, which stipulated that \u201cexpressions that promote prejudice against, or mock or insult individuals on the basis of gender, age, education level, disabilities, regional origin, socioeconomic status and race must be refrained from.\u201d\u201cI hope this agreement would help promote gender equality and multicultural values in our country,\u201d said Kim Hee-jung, Minister of Gender Equality and Family.The agreement was announced almost a year after a United Nations expert on racism urged the Korean government to ensure that the media is \u201csensitive and conscious of the responsibility to avoid racist stereotypes\u201d and that \u201cperpetrators are punished where appropriate\u201d during his visit to Seoul last year. Korea\u2019s concept of \u201cmulticultural families\u201d in particular was often used in the local media to convey negative connotations of foreign workers and migrant wives from Southeast Asia, said U.N. expert Mutuma Ruteere, who also urged Korea to enact a wide-ranging antidiscrimination law.In a report submitted to Ruteere last year, local activist Jung Hye-sil pointed out the term \u201cmixed-blood\u201d was still being used frequently by the Korean media when referring to multiracial individuals, in spite of the U.N. committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\u2019s 2007 recommendation that Korea end the use of the particular expression. The committee also urged the Korean public to overcome the notion that the country is \u201cethnically homogeneous\u201d back in 2007.According to Jung\u2019s report, however, a total of 1,287 Korean news reports -- from both print and broadcast outlets -- used the term \u201cmixed-blood\u201d when referring to multiracial individuals from 2012-2014. Jung also addressed that a number of these reports were favorable toward those with a Caucasian parent, notably by praising their physical attractiveness. The report also pointed out that the Korean media unnecessarily differentiates between multiracial children and children of foreign-born immigrants who are not ethnically Korean. For example, a news segment aired by MBC in 2012 used the term \u201cmixed-blood multicultural children\u201d when delivering information that Korean-born children of migrant wives are more likely to receive education in Korea than children immigrants who were born overseas.\u201cThe discourse of ethnic homogeneity based on the notion of \u2018pure blood\u2019 has been causing discrimination in the form of social exclusion by placing restrictions on the lives of the multiracial population in Korea, as they are seen as a threat to Korea\u2019s \u2018pure bloodline,\u2019\u201d Jung wrote in her report, noting that the very first children who were sent overseas for foreign adoption in 1954 from Korea were mixed-race children born to African-American soldiers and Korean women.Jung also pointed out that a large number of news reports in Korea described multicultural families as troubled beings or \u201cpotential problems for the future\u201d in need of social support. From 2012-2014, a total of 69 reports aired by the nation\u2019s three main broadcasters, MBC, KBS and SBS, described multicultural families as those \u201cin need of support,\u201d while 27 reports referred to them as those who belong to a \u201cmarginalized group,\u201d rather than active members of society or citizens. A total of 40 news reports also dealt with problems that children of such families faced. Only one report described the children of multicultural families as potential \u201cglobal talents.\u201dIn the print media, 1,792 stories described the families as marginalized groups that need support, while only 67 stories referred to the children of the families as global talents. Such reports are based on a notion that welfare services for immigrants are being provided by the generosity or benevolence of Korean citizens, rather than seeing welfare as a right to all immigrants, the report said. \u201cEven the reports that describe the children as \u2018global talents\u2019 are based on the notion that these children need support (from Koreans) in order to become useful global citizens,\u201d Jung wrote.Heo Young-sook from Women Migrants Human Rights Center for Korea also addressed that internalized white supremacy can be seen in today\u2019s TV shows in Korea. In her report submitted to the U.N., she pointed that when a Korean person married a (Caucasian) citizen of a Western country, his or her family was referred to as a \u201cglobal family\u201d with a positive connotation by hosts on TV shows. On the other hand, families where a Korean man married a woman from a Southeast Asian country were called \u201cmulticultural families,\u201d a term that shows stigmatization and is discriminatory among Koreans.\u201cThe Korean government\u2019s policies for migrant wives aim to implement social integration based on discriminatory perspectives against women and ethnic minorities, rather than implementing multiculturalism based on pluralism,\u201d Heo wrote.As of this year, more than 80 percent of immigrants residing in Korea are from countries in Asia, the largest number coming from China and Vietnam.According to Rep. Jin Sun-mee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the number of marriage migrants increased significantly from 142,015 in 2007 to 305,446 this year. More than 85 percent of marriage migrants in Korea are women.Activist Jung also said many TV comedy and variety shows in Korea are ignorant to discriminatory remarks, having casually used terms such as \u201cdark son-in-law\u201d or \u201cdark brothers.\u201dDuring his visit to Seoul last year, Ruteere also addressed that the vast majority of policies toward multicultural families applied only to foreign women who marry a Korean man, and not vice versa. \u201cThe definition of these marriages also excludes families where both of the couple are migrant workers from a non-Korean background, he said.Despite his requests, the U.N. expert was not given a chance to speak to any of the country\u2019s ministers during his visit to Korea last year.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","198":"South Korea said Sunday it has agreed with the U.S. to hold regular talks on space development starting next year.The announcement came in line with President Park Geun-hye's visit to the U.S., where she agreed with U.S. President Barack Obama to push for exchanges in space development.Park and Obama decided to seek the signing of a space cooperation agreement in the near future, with the regular meeting starting in the first half of 2016.

(Yonhap)","200":"Last week's temporary suspension of the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise in the face of North Korean threats could raise questions about Washington's commitment to the defense of the Asian ally, a U.S. expert said.Dennis Halpin, a visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University's U.S.-Korea Institute, made the point in an article to the Weekly Standard magazine on Aug. 21, 2015, saying the suspension was akin to the 1992 cancellation of the then joint exercise Team Spirit.\"An even momentary suspension of a scheduled joint military exercise in the face of threats cannot be reassuring to our South Korean allies who are looking for strong commitment at this critical juncture,\" Halpin said. \"It also raises questions over whether the loudly proclaimed 'pivot' to Asia is, in fact, no more than a pirouette.\"Last week, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear told reporters that the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise had been temporarily suspended and then resumed as the two sides needed to do some coordination over an exchange of artillery fire with North Korea.Halpin said the decision was similar to the 1992 cancellation of the Team Spirit exercise, which was made in order to remove an \"irritant to North Korea\" after the two Koreas issued a landmark joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \"So, how did Pyongyang's leaders interpret the suspension in 1992 of the Team Spirit exercise, a defensive exercise held both for military preparedness and to reassure our South Korean allies of our commitment to security and peace on the Korean peninsula?\" the expert said.Rather than seeing the decision as an act of good will, the North responded with defiance, blocking International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said.\"Brinksmanship is the modus operandi for North Korea's Kim family. Thus seeking to placate their regime is only playing the diplomatic game on their terms,\" Halpin said, quoting a book authored by North Korea expert Chuck Downs.

Detailed descriptions and images highlighting the Danish capital\u2019s sustainable transformation over the last four decades are showcased at \u201cCopenhagen Solutions,\u201d which runs until Sept. 8. The exhibition provides insights for Seoul\u2019s citizens and government, which is vying to be Asia\u2019s leading city in sustainable initiatives through campaigns promoting alternatives to nuclear power and a greater use of public transportation.\u00a0 The Danish Embassy\u2019s First Secretary Lea Stubbe Teglbjaerg (center) introduces the exhibition \u201cCopenhagen Solutions\u201d to visitors at the Seoul City Hall lobby last Wednesday. Joel Lee \/ The Korea HeraldDenmark and Korea have stepped up collaboration in green growth in recent years, as both countries are leaders in green technology and information technology. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon visited Copenhagen last year to bolster cooperation in public transportation and observe its bicycle infrastructure.As Copenhagen aims to be the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral city by 2025, it has promoted collaboration and open communication between diverse players for transparent and effective city development and management.The combined efforts of municipalities, businesses and society have turned the dilapidated industrial city into a vibrant green city since 2000. Denmark\u2019s master plans target public transportation, mixed area use, social housing, energy-efficient buildings, and big data monitoring, helping to attract business with a long-term and stable investment climate.Like most other cities around the world, Copenhagen\u2019s growth in the latter half of the 20th century entailed severe traffic congestion and air pollution. To relieve the situation, the municipal government invested heavily in uninterrupted cycle lanes and public transportation, which continue to be key aspects of urban governance. According to the State of Green \u2015 a Danish green technology promotional agency \u2015 half of all work and school trips in Copenhagen involve cycling. This has reduced travel time, noise, air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, improving citizens\u2019 health while reducing health care costs. Cycling-related injuries decreased by over 70 percent since 2005, thanks to bicycle-friendly infrastructure and a safe driving culture. Copenhagen\u2019s integrated city governance is based on a holistic partnership between planners, city councilors, architects, engineers, investors, contractors, builders and citizens. Since the early 2000s, the city government transformed the polluted harbor into a clean recreational waterfront by modernizing the sewage system, initiating a cleaning program and constructing harbor baths. Citizens now swim, sail and fish in the Copenhagen Harbor year round. Adjacent property prices increased by nearly 60 percent and flooding risks have decreased. As a prime example of waterfront renovation, the Nordhavnen industrial harbor, comprised of islets and canals on Copenhagen\u2019s eastern shore, is being turned into a dense city district accommodating 40,000 residents and 40,000 work spaces. A \u201csmart city\u201d prototype, it will use CO2-neutral energy solutions, smart grids, district heating and cooling, and public transit systems integrating bike paths, pedestrian walkways and subways. All buildings in Copenhagen were required to join the district heating scheme as part of an integrated municipal energy control system since 1993. District heating is one of the most carbon-efficient ways to produce and supply energy locally, and lowers CO2 emissions by 40 percent compared to gas and 50 percent compared to oil boilers. To combat the rising inner-city temperature from global warming, Copenhagen built two district cooling networks, which produce and distribute cooled water to buildings through underground pipelines. It reduces dependence on air-conditioning, saving 14,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. It has also turned rooftops where air-conditioners were once stored into green gardens, helping cool the city temperature. To reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Copenhagen has prioritized biomass technologies that generate energy by incinerating waste products. 60,000 tons of CO2 emissions are expected to be saved by the technology. Copenhagen has partnered with the Swedish city of Malmo across the sea for regional solutions in sustainable living and commerce. The two cities are working to strengthen collaboration in innovative research, clean technology, life sciences and ICT solutions.Copenhagen has also recently partnered Hamburg in the creative industries, climate adaptation, renewable energy, tourism, culture, and research and development.

They are remaining in an enhanced status as part of the exercise, and of course to ensure adequate deterrence on the peninsula,\" he said.The exercise UFG is the world's largest computerized military drill aimed at defending the South from a North Korean attack, involving nearly 80,000 South Korean and U.S. troops.\u00a0North Korea has long condemned such drills as a rehearsal for invasion of the country despite repeated assurances from Seoul and Washington that the exercises are purely defensive in nature.\"We use these exercises to heighten readiness and as a result of the fact that we're conducting this exercise, we are able to communicate and coordinate very efficiently with our ROK partners,\" Shear said.

The Sept. 3 event is expected to demonstrate China\u2019s fast-growing military capabilities, while highlighting a rivalry between China and Japan. It also comes as neighboring countries of China keep a wary eye on Beijing\u2018s increasingly assertive actions in disputed waters, including the South China Sea, sparking a series of diplomatic rows with neighbors like the Philippines and Vietnam. China is also engaged in a bitter dispute with Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Announcing military assets that will be on display during the parade, Qu Rui, deputy director of the Office of the Parade Leading Team of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, told reporters that the Sept. 3 event will \u201crepresent the new development, new achievements and new images of the building of the Chinese armed forces.\u201d \u201cThe number of troops participating in the parade is about 12,000,\u201d Qu told reporters during a press conference. \u201cAt the same time, more than 500 pieces of 40-odd types of equipment, and nearly 200 aircraft of 20-plus types will be demonstrated in the parade,\u201d Qu said.\u201cAll weaponry and equipment displayed are Chinese made main equipment, 84 percent of which are shown for the first time.\u201d Such a display of new military assets will \u201crepresent new development, new achievements and new images of the building of the Chinese armed forces,\u201d Qu said.

(Yonhap)","206":"U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump insisted Monday that South Korea is getting a defense free ride from the United States, claiming the contribution Seoul pays for the upkeep of American troops is \"peanuts,\" compared with what the U.S. spends.Trump made the remark during a campaign speech in New Hampshire after an audience member pointed out that it's inaccurate to claim that South Korea pays nothing for the U.S. defending the country and that Seoul paid more than $860 million last year to help with the upkeep of U.S. troops stationed in the country.\"It's peanuts compared to what it's costing. It's peanuts,\" Trump said in response.\"They are a very wealthy country ... We are defending Germany, we are defending Japan, we are defending South Korea, we're defending so many countries, we get peanuts. We get nothing. We get a -- you're right. We get a small payment. It's a fraction, a tiny fraction,\" he said.Trump has repeatedly accused South Korea of relying on the U.S. for its defense while giving the U.S. nothing in return even though the country makes a lot of money.In July, he said that whenever South Korea \"is in trouble, our military takes care. You know we get nothing.\" In August, Trump also said that South Korea is making a fortune, but the U.S. sends its troops to defend the Asian ally in exchange for \"nothing.\" In Monday's speech, Trump stressed South Korea is making a lot of money.\"I ordered 4,000 television sets recently for a big project.They all come from South Korea. My only bidder was South Korea, except for Sony, which is in Japan, and they lost their way, OK?\" Trump said. \"My only bidder -- whether it's LG or whether it's Samsung -- these are wealthy countries. We have 28,000 soldiers on the border of South Korea.\" Trump made similar criticism of Germany and Japan as well.\"We defend Germany, which is sending cars and everything over there ... it's an economic behemoth.\" Trump said. \"We defend Japan, and we have to defend them with our lives. If anybody attacks Japan, we have an agreement, we have to go and attack and fight and die and spend. But if anybody attacks us, Japan doesn't have to do a thing. That's the way we run things.\"Trump said the reason why the U.S. has huge defense budget is because \"we're defending all these countries.\"\"It's not helping us. So we are going to change things around, and we're going to make America great again. Believe me,\" he said.Trump's criticism shows his ignorance about American security interests and policy.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.

But it also entails daunting geopolitical challenges the divided country has long confronted. Participants of the Seoul-led Eurasia Express journey wave for a photo at Perm Station in Russia on July 25 during their 14,400-kilometer trip from Beijing and Vladivostok to Berlin. (Yonhap)Despite a series of constant obstacles to its diplomacy including a nuclearizing North Korea, the South has consistently pushed to expand its foreign policy coverage toward the continent that has emerged as the fulcrum of global power and wealth.In recent years, the Park Geun-hye government has been revving up its \u201cEurasia Initiative\u201d to link transport and energy infrastructure across the Eurasian plate, though geopolitics still gets in the way of its implementation.Analysts say Seoul should continue to explore diplomatic and economic possibilities based on its middle-power clout, and take advantage of enhanced ties with Eurasian states to find solutions to North Korea issues.\u201cPerched on the easternmost tip of Eurasia, South Korea largely has two options for its diplomacy: One is moving toward the western Pacific and the other toward the constellation of continental players in Eurasia -- Russia, Central Asia and Europe,\u201d said Kim Tae-hyung, international relations professor at Soongsil University.\u201cEurasia has historically offered both opportunities and challenges. Despite geopolitical hindrances, there has been no other choice for Seoul but to constantly explore possibilities there to advance its economic interests and help address peninsular issues such as reunification.\u201dUncontrollable outside influences have long constrained Korea\u2019s independent diplomacy toward the continent, making it difficult for the peninsular state to develop its full geopolitical potential as a bridge between maritime and continental civilizations, historians say.Korea\u2019s strategic thinking toward Eurasia was impeded often by the regional power dynamics, notably when China held a suzerain-tributary relationship with Korea under a Sino-centric order that existed until the mid-19th century, and Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.The Cold War -- when Korea stood as a stalwart ally of the U.S. in an intense political, military and ideological conflict against the then communist bloc led by the Soviet Union -- also crippled Korea\u2019s Eurasia-bound diplomacy.\u201cGiven its location on the map, Korea possesses the geopolitical advantages as a \u2018peninsular, bridge and border state.\u2019 But those advantages have turned into geopolitical ordeals throughout the country\u2019s checkered history,\u201d said Park Myung-lim, a peace scholar at Yonsei University. \u201cIn order to overcome these challenges, South Korea needs a comprehensive strategy toward Eurasia that also includes addressing North Korea\u2019s nuclear issue, as a crucial task to spur the South\u2019s Eurasia drive.\u201dIn the late 1980s toward the end of the Cold War, new opportunities emerged for Korea to step up its diplomacy for Eurasian states.Riding the international reconciliatory mood and the socialist bloc\u2019s moves toward openness and reform, the Roh Tae-woo government pushed for \u201cNordpolitik,\u201d or Northern Policy -- a bold initiative regarded as one of South Korea\u2019s most successful foreign policy approaches. Taking its name from the West Germany policy of Ostpolitik, or Eastern Policy, toward then-East Germany, Seoul\u2019s policy drive sought to establish diplomatic relations with the traditional allies of North Korea -- the former Soviet Union and China -- and other socialist states, with an aim to improve its economy and pressure the North to take steps to reduce cross-border tensions.Under the initiative, South Korea built ties with Hungary and Poland in 1989. In 1990, it established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, then Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Seoul also established ties with Moscow that year and with China two years later. \u201cWhen Nordpolitik was adopted, diplomatic situations were very favorable, and the Roh government grabbed the chance to clear the obstacles that had clogged up Korea\u2019s diplomacy toward the wider Eurasian continent,\u201d said Chun In-young, professor emeritus at Seoul National University.Amid the international criticism of China\u2019s bloody crackdowns on the massive democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, the Chinese government took Seoul\u2019s diplomatic overture as a chance to ease its isolation. The then-Soviet Union also welcomed Seoul\u2019s northward policy as an opportunity to facilitate its policy of openness and reform.Based on the diplomatic foundation that Nordpolitik laid, South Korea continued to pursue deeper ties with China, Russia and other former communist states, although its security alliance with the U.S. against North Korean aggression has posed challenges to managing ties with America\u2019s former foes. As the regional powers have vied to expand their influence over Eurasia that accounts for more than 70 percent of the world\u2019s population and 60 percent of the global GDP, Seoul renewed its policy attention to the continent in recent years.In October 2013, some eight months into office, President Park Geun-hye unveiled her Eurasia Initiative through which she has strived to bolster economic cooperation with Eurasian states by establishing a pan-Eurasia system of transport and energy networks that link Korea to those states.Seoul has promoted the initiative to revitalize the regional economy, create jobs, push Pyongyang toward openness and reform, defuse cross-border tensions and lay the groundwork for national reunification. As part of the initiative, Seoul launched the \u201cEurasia Express\u201d last month. The project is a 20-day, 14,400-kilometer railway trip reaching Germany\u2019s Berlin via China\u2019s Beijing and Russia\u2019s Vladivostok. Garnering much global attention, the project raised hopes that Pyongyang would participate as an integral part of the initiative to help promote peace and cooperation in the region.The so-called Rajin-Khasan logistic cooperation project involving North Korea is also part of the initiative. The project seeks to modernize the 54-kilometer-long Rajin-Hasan railway, which is to be used to transport freight from Hasan in Russia to Rajin in the North by railway, and then to a South Korean port by ship.To test the feasibility of the project, some 45,000 tons of coal from Russia was transported to Pohang, South Korea\u2019s southeastern port city, via Rajin last November, and another 140,000 tons to three South Korean ports in Dangjin, Gwangyang and Boryeong in April this year.With much publicity, the Eurasia Initiative appears to have fared well. But a series of geopolitical variables darken the prospect of its success: North Korea under the fledgling leadership of Kim Jong-un continues to raise security uncertainties on the peninsula and Russia\u2019s ongoing conflict with the West to aggravate geopolitical tensions.\u201cThe strategic vision embedded in the initiative is forward-looking and necessary for Korea\u2019s future. Yet, current overall geopolitical conditions are not favorable for Seoul to actively push for it,\u201d said Chun of Seoul National University. \u201cSecurity conditions are still bad due to North Korea\u2019s adherence to its nuclear ambitions, while Russia\u2019s Putin engages in a conflict with the West and seeks to evolve strategic ties with China, which the U.S. strives to keep in check.\u201dAbove all, the trickiest variable for the successful implementation of the Eurasia drive is North Korea, experts said, stressing the need for the South to devise a more effective, creative way to lift the North out of the political, economic backwater.\u201cEven though there will be a flurry of economic, cultural and people-to-people exchanges across the continent, the issues of peace and security, which obviously trump other issues, have remained unsettled with the North posing constant security challenges,\u201d said Park of Yonsei University.\u201cIn light of this, South Korea needs to focus more on the North Korea issue as a key point of its Eurasia initiative. It also needs a more comprehensive Eurasian strategy, which includes stably managing relations with both the U.S. and China, to maximize its potential as a peninsular state.\u201dBy Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","208":"President Park Geun-hye visited a military base near Seoul Friday to check South Korea's military readiness, Cheong Wa Dae said Friday, after a recent exchange of shells between the two Koreas heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0\u00a0The surprise visit to the headquarters of Third Army in Yogin, Gyeonggi Province, came as North Korea threatened to take military action unless South Korea halts propaganda broadcasts along the heavily fortified border.\u00a0\u00a0Park is set to receive a briefing from top military officials on the latest situation, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.\u00a0\u00a0On Thursday, North Korea gave a 48-hour ultimatum for South Korea to end the psychological warfare and dismantle its loudspeakers, otherwise it will launch \"a strong military action.\"\u00a0\u00a0South Korea has rejected the North's demand, stoking fears of yet another military clash between the two sides after they briefly exchanged artillery shells over the western section of their border on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered front-line troops to have full combat readiness and front-line areas to be in a \"semi-war state\" starting at 5 p.m. on Friday, according to the North's state media.\u00a0\u00a0South Korea resumed psychological warfare on Aug. 10 in retaliation for a recent land mine attack that left two South Korean soldiers severely injured.\u00a0\u00a0South Korea accused the North of planting the mines inside the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas, a charge denied by North Korea.

The court invalidated the ban, recognizing the unregistered migrants as \u201cworkers\u201d in accordance with labor law if they offer labor in return for wage. (Ock Hyun-ju\/The Korea Herald)Following the ruling, the MTU requested an authorization permit from the ministry.

The MTU\u2019s bylaws had included that it would pursue legalizing unregistered migrant workers in Korea and abolishing the Employment Permit System, which led the ministry to demand the union to water down the clauses in question. \u201cSuch clause was viewed as politically oriented, as it had nothing to do with improving their working conditions,\u201d the official said.

Oh Joon, was delivered to the UNSC chairman Tuesday, New York time. This month, Nigeria undertakes the rotating UNSC chairmanship.\u00a0(Yonhap)In the letter, Seoul explained the result of its investigation into the land mine detonation in the Demilitarized Zone, calling the UNSC\u2019s attention to the provocation, which it calls a \u201cthreat to peace on the Korean Peninsula and a violation of the Armistice Agreement.\u201d\u201cUpon our request, the letter has been read by the member states of the UNSC. The letter is expected to be adopted as an official UNSC document today or tomorrow, and posted on the UNSC-related website as well,\u201d the official told reporters.The latest provocation has sharply raised cross-border tensions, leading the two Koreas to begin intensive propaganda campaigns against each other through loudspeakers near the heavily fortified border. Seoul\u2019s investigators concluded that the North placed three wooden-box land mines intentionally near the Military Demarcation Line within the DMZ separating the two Koreas. Seoul warned that Pyongyang would \u201cpay dearly\u201d for the incident, while the North denies its responsibility.The letter is not specifically intended to urge the UNSC to issue a statement against the provocation. But it would be part of an accumulation of evidence of Pyongyang\u2019s continued provocations that threaten the peninsular peace and stability, the official noted. \u201cWe sent the letter, believing that, should the North engage in another provocative act, this letter would show to the international community the repetitive nature of North Korean provocations,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the act of sending the letter is quite rare, this shows that we took the case very seriously.\u201d Meanwhile, 38 North, run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that recent satellite imagery indicates that Pyongyang has conducted an engine test at a satellite launch station on its west coast. This analysis came amid growing speculation that the reclusive state might engage in a provocative act around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers\u2019 Party.The research website also said that the North has been installing two new, larger, storage buildings for fuel and oxidizer at the rocket launch site. But it pointed out that recent satellite imagery still shows \u201cno signs of launch preparations.\u201d\u201cWhen complete, they will provide more than double the storage capacity of the existing structures, suggesting that the North Koreans are developing a capability to test larger, more capable engines,\u201d the website said.Local media reports said that the North was spotted preparing for short-range missile launches at its launch sites on its east and west coasts. The missiles could be KN-02 ground-to-ground missiles with ranges of up to 160 km or Scud missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 km.The North has launched short-range missiles in a show of force before or after the South Korea-U.S. military drills, which it has denounced as a \u201crehearsal for a nuclear war of invasion\u201d against it.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","215":"Vice foreign ministers of South Korea and Pakistan will hold policy talks next week to further bilateral ties across all sectors ranging from politics to development, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong will visit Pakistan next Tuesday to hold the ninth round of vice ministerial policy talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, ministry spokesman Noh Kwang-il said in a press briefing.The two sides plan to discuss ways to strengthen practical ties in political, economic and development affairs in a follow-up to then-Prime Minister Chung Hong-won's visit to Pakistan in April last year, the spokesman said.Also on the agenda will be the political situations on the Korean Peninsula and in South Asia, as well as cooperation on the international stage, he added.

(Claire Lee\/The Korea Herald)The two activists were to show up at the audit as witnesses of the Gender Ministry\u2019s recent denial of LGBTI rights, involving the Daejeon Metropolitan City\u2019s newly revised charter of gender equality. In August, the ministry sent the municipal government of Daejeon an official order to delete the charter\u2019s newly introduced articles guaranteeing LGBTI rights, after receiving complaints from gay rights opponents and religious groups. \u201cEvery other witness, six of them, who had been previously scheduled to attend the audit ended up attending the audit,\u201d said Na Young, one of the LGBTI activists protesting against the ministry and the committee. Rep. You Seung-hee\u2019s office denied the accusations. \u201cThe chairwoman of the committee cannot finalize the list of witnesses by herself,\u201d said Kim In-ah from Rep. Yoo\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s untrue that Rep. You denied their entry.\u201dWomen and human rights\u2019 activists have been demanding the ministry recognize and validate LGBTI rights as a gender issue, while the ministry has said the rights of sexual minorities are irrelevant to the Gender Equality Act. It instead explained that the issue falls under the Human Rights Commission and the National Human Rights Commission Act.The activists tried to hand deliver a letter to Gender Minister Kim Hee-jung after the audit session. As the minister refused to accept it, Kim\u2019s secretary accepted it instead. The activists said they told the secretary that the particular incident involving the Gender Ministry and the gender equality charter of Daejeon will be addressed at a meeting with U.N. Women\u2019s Policy Director Dr. Purna Sen in New York later this month.

Unemployed and depressed since her bitter divorce, the mother would drink about 20 bottles of soju a week, and would fail to provide basic care for her young children. The boy and his sister, 6, would skip dinner most days. A number of times, the suicidal mother asked them if it \u201cwould be better if they all killed themselves together.\u201dAs a social worker working for a state-run agency, Lee said he has personally witnessed many domestic violence abusers with drinking problems. Lee\u2019s observation was demonstrated in a recent study, which found a significant connection between alcohol abuse and domestic and sexual violence in South Korea.\u00a0 A recent study found a significant connection between alcohol abuse and domestic and sexual violence in South Korea. (123RF)The scholarly article from Dongguk University, which surveyed 4,851 arrested individuals for violent crimes last year, showed that 73.1 percent of the domestic violence abusers and 67.9 percent of sex offenders committed their offenses while under the influence of alcohol. While some say violent abusers with untreated alcoholism should face heavier punishment, others point out that those with low socioeconomic status are much more vulnerable to addiction and committing crimes, and therefore a stronger safety net is needed to tackle the issue in the long run. In 2009, a shocking case of child rape drove Korea into a fury when it was revealed that the assailant, a 57-year-old named Cho Doo-soon, was given 12 years in prison after damaging 80 percent of the young victim\u2019s colon through his offense. That year, the court said Cho had \u201cdiminished capacity for his decisions\u201d because he was drunk at the time of the offense, which weighed into the sentencing. The victim, who was 8 at the time of the incident in 2008, was also abducted and beaten by Cho before being raped. Cho had been unemployed and addicted to alcohol.Lee Won-jeong, a police officer who authored the study for Dongguk University, claimed that criminals should never be given reduced punishments for \u201cbeing drunk\u201d at the time of the offense. Instead, ex-convicts with a record of alcohol addiction who chose not to get the required medical treatment should face heavier penalties should they become second offenders, he wrote. \u201cIn order to do this, the police should establish a separate team that monitors all offenders with drinking problems, and that offers treatment options so they don\u2019t repeat their mistakes again,\u201d he wrote. Social worker Lee said most domestic violence cases against children he witnessed were triggered by marital problems and the financial problems of the parents. The abusive, alcoholic mother, for example, became depressed after her husband suddenly went missing. After the divorce, the unemployed mother relied on state subsidies given to destitute individuals who make less than the government-designated minimum cost of living. She soon started drinking alone at night. \u201cShe kept telling me that she no longer wants to live,\u201d Lee said, \u201cand that she can\u2019t even kill herself because of her children. In many cases that I have seen, they had three signs before the abuse took place -- divorce, depression and alcoholism.\u201dStudies have shown that Korean domestic abuse offenders with drinking problems tend to have low socioeconomic status. A 2012 research paper by the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation, which surveyed 142 domestic violence offenders with alcoholism, showed that 30 percent of them were unemployed while 43 percent were temporary workers on daily contracts. Almost 50 percent of them attended up to elementary or middle school. Meanwhile, 99.3 percent of them were men.Park Seong-su, a professor at Semyung University\u2019s police administration program, said addiction can be more prone to affect people who are faced with overwhelming situations or unresolved emotions. \u201cYou need something to focus on in order to forget about whatever problems you have in your real life,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can be common in people who are faced with financial hardships and a lack of support. Feelings of helplessness are what often cause depression, and depression often leads to addictions.\u201dThe study also found that 54.5 percent of the offenders had a father who also had drinking problems. Almost 55 percent of them said it\u2019s their anger and distrust for their wives that led to their abusive behavior, while 23.9 percent said their low self-confidence triggered domestic abuse. Also, 21.8 percent cited stress as the main cause of their violence. Korea is notorious for its culture of binge drinking. In a report released last year by Euromonitor, a London-based market intelligence firm, Koreans were said to drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average, making them the heaviest drinkers in the world, beating out the Russians and Thais.Meanwhile, confirmed cases of child abuse in Korea jumped nearly 50 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being the parents. According to the latest data available from the Gender Equality Ministry, 46.1 percent of Korean parents abused their children at least once in 2013, and 45.5 percent of married Koreans were abused by their spouses in the same year. Social worker Lee said many children who have been abused by their parents often don\u2019t want to be separated from their mothers and fathers in spite of the violence. \u201cThe child of the alcoholic mother in fact refused to speak further when I asked him more about his mother,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat is best for the children in abusive homes, I think, is to treat their parents and reunite them once they are healthy. What would be even better is to prevent addiction and other mental illnesses in socially and financially vulnerable homes.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","219":"China's commerce ministry said Wednesday that the country is facing a \"more severe situation\" in its foreign trade for the rest of this year, fanning concerns that Beijing could devalue its yuan currency further after a surprise cut last week. \"For the second-half of this year, China's foreign trade situation will face more severity than we expected,\" China's commerce ministry spokesman Shen Danyang told reporters during a regular press briefing. Shen said the Chinese economy is also facing \"a lot of uncertainty,\" but did not elaborate further. The Chinese central bank devalued its tightly-controlled yuan currency last week, letting the yuan fall by the most in nearly two decades. Following disappointing economic data, the surprise move triggered fears of a currency war because a weak yuan helps boost Chinese exports overseas, while deepening worries over the health of the world's second-largest economy. Before last week's major devaluation, the yuan's value against the U.S. dollar had been barely changed, but the yuan lost about 3 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar. In July, China's exports plunged 8.3 percent from the same month last year, while imports dived 8.1 percent year-on-year. China targets this year's economic growth rate at 7 percent, marking the slowest expansion in 25 years.

Prosecutors said Kim received 520 million won ($422,000) in kickbacks and free alcohol from Song in exchange for promising him business favors between October 2010 and December 2011.The councilor, however, failed to carry out a promise of stopping a rival wedding hall from being built near Song's business.The 45-year-old Kim allegedly ordered the murder after Song threatened to upset his election campaign last year by revealing the unpaid debt. Song made the threat after Kim failed to carry out the promise he had made. The councilor had been pressured to repay the money since late 2012.The 45-year-old murderer surnamed Paeng was given 20 years in prison by the court.

Nine of them still remain missing.\"The ultimate objective of the recovery plan is to find the missing people,\" the ministry has said.The 85.1 billion won ($72 million) project to recover the ship, the Sewol, has been awarded to a Chinese consortium led by China's state-run Shanghai Salvage.The consortium has said it will close all openings of the ship with nets to prevent any contents of the ship from slipping out.Ministry officials earlier said the actual work to hoist the ship will likely begin early next year, with completion before the end of June.

China usually sends its premier to the talks.South Korea, however, remains cautious about a separate summit between Park and Abe amid strained bilateral ties.\"There is no change in our position regarding a South Korea-Japan summit. Basically, we are open to it,\" Noh said. \"But there should be talks for the two countries to build sustainable trust, not talks for the sake of talks. For that, conditions should be created for such talks.\"In his World War II anniversary speech last week, the Japanese prime minister evaded giving his own apology for the nation's militaristic past, including the brutal colonization of Korea from 1910-45.

Choi Yoon-hee, chairman of the JCS, told the commander of a military unit on the eastern border, according to the JCS.Choi visited the front-line unit earlier in the day to inspect its combat readiness posture in the wake of North Korea's recent land mine detonation on the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone.Choi inspected an observation post only 1.3 kilometers away from a North Korean front-line guard post, and checked on a recently-launched loudspeaker propaganda operation in the area, the JCS said. He also examined the military unit's vigilance and other operations in the DMZ, according to the JCS.\"The reason why North Korea is reacting sensitively to psychological warfare is our psychological operations pose fears bigger than those posed by any other high-tech weapons,\" Choi said, referring to the propaganda campaign that South Korea launched last week.For the first time in 11 years, South Korea fully resumed its cross-border propaganda campaign, a sort of psychological warfare, in retaliation for the North's mine provocation.Two South Korean staff sergeants were maimed as three land mines believed to have been buried by the North exploded in the southern half of the DMZ on Aug. 4. The North, in return, has also revived its propaganda broadcasting at the border, for the first time since an inter-Korean agreement suspended it in 2004.A large-scale joint military exercise launched Monday between South Korea and the United States, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is also fueling military tension on the peninsula with the North threatening counteractions to what it denounces as a rehearsal for invasion.

Lee Sang-hoon, the chief commander of the Marine Corps, completed his two-day combat posture inspection of the country's five front-line islands in the Yellow Sea, including Yeonpyeong Island, where North Korea launched deadly shelling attacks in 2010. During the inspection, which started on Monday, Lee also instructed troops to \"pull the trigger boldly\" if provoked by the North, according to a news release from the Marine Corps. \"If the North provokes, put all the grievances about the Cheonan ship torpedoing, the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island and the latest DMZ wooden-box mine explosion under the name of the Marine Corps and retaliate,\" Lee was quoted as saying during the visit.

(Yonhap)","226":"The South Korean government Tuesday denied local rumors that toxic chemicals from the Tianjin blast in China may affect the peninsula.Unidentified online rumors have spread in the country that the toxic substance allegedly leaked from the Chinese blast site last week would likely affect the peninsula. The postings included those who claimed the U.S. Embassy in China had warned people to avoid exposure to the rain as sodium cyanide has leaked into the air. On Sunday, Beijing news outlets reported that Chinese officials had discovered about 700 tons of sodium cyanide was stored at the explosion site, stoking public concerns over the possible leak due to the explosions. Water-soluble solid sodium cyanide forms hydrogen cyanide if treated with acid. The exposure to hydrogen cyanide can cause burns, dermatitis, headaches and even death. The sudden issuance of the ultrafine dust alert over the weekend in Korea added fuel to the rumors that the country would be hit by the toxic chemicals from China. On Sunday morning, the ultrafine dust advisory was raised in Seoul and Incheon for over six hours as the hourly average ultrafine dust concentration exceeded 120 micrograms per cubic meter for more than two hours. The alert was lifted later in the afternoon. The Environment Ministry, however, said the sodium cyanide spreading to Korea is geographically nearly impossible. \u201cTianjin is 800 kilometers away from Seoul, which is too far to be affected,\u201d said the ministry. Experts also played down the concerns, citing the characteristics of the toxic substance. \u201cSodium cyanide is naturally heavier than air. Therefore, it\u2019s nearly impossible to spread through the wind over hundreds of kilometers,\u201d chemistry professor Lee Chong-soon at Yeungnam University told The Korea Herald. The weather data of the blast day also showed little chance of it spreading. \u201cOn Aug. 12, the wind of the concerned region headed from south to southwest, according to the data. This indicates that the wind actually blew in the opposite direction of the peninsula,\u201d said Korea Meteorological Agency officials. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security vowed to carry out an emergency safety inspection on a number of factories and ports that deal with harmful chemical substances as part of its efforts to prevent similar accidents and alleviate public concerns. The safety inspections will be conducted with municipal firefighting departments and four ministries, including the Environment Ministry and Labor and Employment Ministry, the authorities said. It will also hold a group meeting Thursday to review the preventive measures and accident response manuals, they added.

Wang Junsheng, an associate professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also suggested that Park could skip a scheduled military parade, which could highlight a rivalry between China and Japan, during her possible visit to Beijing. Most Western leaders are unlikely to attend the Sept. 3 ceremony hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping because the military parade could send the wrong signal at a time when China is increasingly assertive in its territorial claims in the South China Sea. \"As one of the few ROK leaders who knows the Chinese language and understands Chinese culture, Park has been pushing for the betterment of bilateral ties since taking office two years ago,\" Wang said in an op-ed piece published by the state-run China Daily newspaper. \"Even if she does not attend the Sept. 3 parade, Park's visit to Beijing will be of great importance to regional stability, because if Beijing and Seoul cooperate more closely, Tokyo's neighborhood diplomacy may hardly work. Pyongyang may abandon its rhetoric and act with reason,\" Wang said. The comments by Wang suggested that Park may not attend the morning parade, but attend the afternoon reception on Sept. 3.Park could make a decision on whether to attend China's celebrations as early as later this week, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.South Korean diplomats in Beijing have said that Seoul feels awkward about accepting the Chinese invitation for the military parade because of a rivalry between China and Japan amid Beijing's increasingly assertive actions in territorial disputes with its neighbors. Another embarrassing point is that the military parade will be staged at Tiananmen Square, where the Chinese Communist Party crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in a bloody crackdown in 1989, the diplomats said.South Korea and China are former battlefield foes as China fought alongside North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States and 20 other allied countries fought on South Korea's side under the U.N. flag. (Yonhap)","228":"Military exercises between South Korea and the United States have little effect on Pyongyang's relations with either Washington or Seoul despite bellicose war threats the communist nation makes against such exercises, a U.S. expert said Monday.North Korea harshly denounces annual military exercises South Korea holds with the U.S. as a preparation for war against it.Ahead of the latest round of drills, the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which kicked off Monday, Pyongyang also threatened to take its strongest military counteraction unless the exercises were canceled.Despite such rhetoric, the exercises do not have lasting effects and the situation usually gets back to where it was before the exercises, said Victor Cha, chief Korea analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a report after analyzing 10 years of U.S.-South Korea military exercises from 2005-2014.\"U.S.-ROK military exercises have a null effect in the overall U.S.-DPRK diplomatic relationship. They are not game-changers.\u00a0 The past 10 years of exercises demonstrated a rough correlation with the status of bilateral relationship prior to the exercises,\" Cha said.\"If U.S.-DPRK relations were coded positively prior to the exercises, it remained positive after the exercise, despite North Korean rhetoric on the contrary. On the other hand, if the relationship was coded negatively prior to the exercises, the exercises tended to reinforce the negative relations in terms of both rhetoric and possible provocations,\" he said.The North can also \"insulate\" positive inter-Korean relations from its belligerence against the U.S. during the exercise period, Cha said, adding that inter-Korean ties in 2005 and 2006 remained good despite belligerence against the military exercises.\u00a0 Cha, however, noted that small-scale North Korean provocations during and after the exercise period became more common after 2009.\"Pyongyang's official rhetoric remains a good indicator of possible small-scale provocative actions during the exercise period. Washington and Seoul would do well to listen carefully to Pyongyang's rhetoric in the coming days for potential actions,\" he said.South Korea and the U.S. have long argued that their annual drills are purely defensive in nature. On Monday, State Department spokesman John Kirby reiterated this point.\"These exercises have been long planned and they are exercises that we routinely do with our allies in South Korea and you're right, they have started. They're proceeding normally and apace and we look forward to completing the exercise with them as we always do,\" Kirby said. \"This is about improving alliance capabilities and meeting our security commitments there in the region and on the Korean Peninsula and nothing more than that,\" he said.The latest exercise UFC is the world's largest computerized military drill aimed at defending the South from a North Korean attack, involving nearly 80,000 South Korean and U.S. troops. This year's exercise came amid unusually heightened military tension between the two Koreas following the North's detonation of land mines on the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone earlier this month. (Yonhap)","229":"As South Korea is set to enter the third stage of its opening of the local legal industry, the legal circle here remains split over the impact, with some viewing it as a chance to hone local players\u2019 competence, while others cite rigid regulations that would hem in any drastic change.In early August, the Ministry of Justice submitted a revised draft of the Foreign Legal Consultant Act to implement what would be the final stage of the legal market liberalization under the free trade agreements.Under the revised bill, Korea will be fully open to European and American law firms in July 2016 and March 2017, respectively, allowing them to set up joint ventures with Korean counterparts, hire Korean lawyers and partially practice domestic law as the final step.The plan will also allow \u201cfly-in fly-out\u201d work practices, enabling foreign\u00a0lawyers to temporarily stay in Korea to handle cases requiring international mediation. The gradual opening of the legal sector has come since Korea signed a free trade agreement with the EU in July 2011 and with the U.S. in March 2012.  (The Korea Herald file photo)Foreign law firms were allowed to set up representative offices in Korea immediately after the trade pact took effect, but their roles were limited to providing consulting services on international law as the first step.The second stage, which began two years after the agreements, permitted foreign law firms to split fees with Korean partners.Currently, 25 law firms from the U.S. and the U.K. operate in Korea, with most of them focused on offering consulting services for mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property fair trade, initial public offerings and cross-border litigation for mostly Korean and multinational corporate clients. But the government\u2019s deregulation plan still restricts the foreign law offices from representing clients in Korean courtrooms and handling domestic cases related to inheritance, government affairs and intellectual property, among other fields.On top of that, the foreign law firms that wish to establish a joint operation with Korean counterparts are required to retain at least five lawyers with more than five years of experience and have done business for more than three years. The government has also added a clause banning foreign law firms from owning more than a 49 percent stake in the joint venture \u201cto protect the Korean legal market\u201d from being taken over by foreign legal giants. The Korean Bar Association voiced its concerns over the opening of the legal market, but welcomed the measure to prevent foreign firms from taking control of the joint ventures. \u201cThe opening of the market is nothing new anyway,\u201d its spokesperson said. The Korean legal circle remains divided over the impact of the market liberalization, with some expressing concerns over the ever-intensifying competition in the market and others hailing it as a chance to sharpen Korean law firms\u2019 competitiveness.\u201cThe entry of foreign firms into the local market will lead to economies of scale, which means it will not be as much a threat to large local firms as expected but will take a toll on small ones,\u201d Kim Sang-kyum, a law professor at Dongguk University, told The Korea Herald. \u201cBig-scale joint ventures between foreign firms and local counterparts will end up monopolizing the best-quality domestic lawyers and big corporate clients in the local market, reducing the room for small and medium-sized local firms to grow.\u201d According to sources in the legal community, South Korea\u2019s legal market is estimated to be worth around 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion), though the official figure is not available. But others in the legal industry said that the opening of the market could be an opportunity for Korea\u2019s small and medium-sized law firms to gain a competitive edge to confront the escalating market competition. \u201cThe small and medium-sized law firms have long lagged behind large firms in terms of their consulting skills and influence,\u201d an official from a law firm told The Korea Herald, wishing to remain anonymous. \u201cIf the small firms enter a joint venture with foreign giants, they could complement their lack of networks, clout and consulting skills.\u201d He also played down the likelihood of foreign firms dominating the Korean legal market. \u201cThe final stage of opening the market will still not allow foreign law firms to fully take domestic cases, meaning that the opening will not drastically change the legal landscape,\u201d he said. But he said the competition would inevitably heat up when more foreign firms make headway into the nation on the back of the eased regulations. Foreign law firms have already solidified their position in offering legal advice to big corporate clients since the trade agreement came into force, occupying an estimated half of the legal consulting market. For large local firms, the years-long gradual opening of the market has prepared them to improve their competitiveness by scaling up their size, hiring more English-speaking lawyers and breaking into the foreign market to forge global networks, according to the legal community. \u201cBig Korean law firms now have the capability to survive independently amid the fierce competition,\u201d said the source, who said that his company had no plans to form a joint operation with foreign firms for the very reason.Lee Won-il, a head lawyer at Barun, one of the nation\u2019s big law firms, also believes that the market liberalization will be a chance to upgrade his company and the local legal market as a whole.\u201cIt is premature to expect any outcome for now, but the opening will be a stepping stone for us to face off against global law firms to broaden our clout in the local market,\u201d Lee told The Korea Herald. The foreign firms\u2019 entry into the Korean market also seems to heighten expectations for young local lawyers equipped with overseas experience and English fluency. \u201cThe Korean law firms seem saturated, creating fewer jobs for young lawyers,\u201d said Choi Jung-min, who newly became a lawyer earlier this year. \u201dI expect that more jobs will be generated as foreign firms take root here.\u201dDefying concerns over the impact of the foreign law firms\u2019 entry in the local market, however, the U.S. and British law firms here seemed to remain lukewarm on entering into joint ventures with Korean counterparts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan to set up a joint venture in Korea or recruit local lawyers for the time being,\u201d a spokesperson for U.S. law firm Ropes & Gray told The Korea Herald. \u201cWe are focusing on consulting clients on the U.S., British and Hong Kong law.\u201dAs of last December, eight out of 21 foreign law firms confirmed that they were not considering forming a joint practice with Korean partners, according to a survey. Instead, foreign law firms said they would continue to specialize in their role providing consulting services on foreign laws here, downplaying the idea of being heavily engaged with domestic legal cases.\u00a0 But behind their hesitancy are \u201ctough restrictions\u201d imposed by the government on scope of their work in the domestic market, local sources said. \u201cWhen the discussion began over the opening of the Korean legal market years ago, foreign firms had expected that they could hire Korean lawyers as well as represent Korean clients in Korean courtrooms,\u201d a source said.

Kim Jeong-won, one of the two bedridden frontline soldiers injured in the blast, said in a media interview earlier this week.An army soldier engages in a mission to detect minds near the inter-Korean border on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Indeed, what Seoul\u2019s defense authorities have shown to the public in the wake of the Aug. 4 incident is a flurry of emotion-laden pledges to \u201cretaliate\u201d and strengthen border defense, which includes resuming loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and installing camera-equipped drones.Defense Minister Han Min-koo ordered the military to respond \u201cbravely and unsparingly\u201d if provoked, with his ministry upbraiding the North for violating the Armistice Agreement and vowing to make it \u201cpay dearly\u201d for the blast.But what seems to be missing in Seoul\u2019s reaction is deep soul-searching regarding the seemingly porous frontline defense that again allowed the unpredictable state to catch Seoul\u2019s defense establishment off guard and launch what could have been a deadly attack.This discussion, of course, is by far subsequent to nationwide and international condemnation and warning against North Korea, which once again resorted to provocation in violation of the cease-fire treaty, a grave challenge against the stability of the Korean Peninsula. However, repeated vows of retaliation seem to be routine practice for the South Korean military, which has come under fire for having failed to fend off North Korea\u2019s apparently periodic provocations, including the two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 48 South Korean troops and two civilians.Seoul\u2019s harsher rhetoric against Pyongyang\u00a0could even be seen by critics\u00a0as a move to divert public attention from its sore spots and circumvent the emerging public criticism that \u201cthe better-equipped South once again was dealt a blow by the ill-equipped North.\u201dWhat\u2019s fortunate is, of course, that no fatalities occurred, thanks to the South Korean troop who took proper emergency response steps, although the two soldiers suffered indelible physical and mental scars.Rather than focusing on how to outdo the North in the game of provocation, the South Korean military needs to ask itself fundamental questions: Why has the defense been porous? How can it prevent a recurrence? Has it ever been complacent? Are there other possible ways of future North Korean provocations?Long embroiled in seemingly ceaseless disputes over defense industry corruption, inter-service rivalries and animosities \u201camong friendly forces,\u201d which stem from abuses in the barracks, the military should really think about how it can reinforce itself -- and do so strongly enough to deter the evolving North Korean provocations. As the Seoul government dealt with the land mine incident, it has also revealed what appears to be a lack of inter-agency coordination. The land mine explosions took place last Tuesday. A day later, Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry proposed working-level government talks with the North to discuss a range of pending issues. All the while, the investigation was ongoing to determine whether the North was to blame for the incident.Seoul officials said that the dialogue proposal was made as nothing had been determined of the explosion at the time. But critics argue that it illustrates a lack of coordination between the ministries of defense and unification, though Seoul may want to say it was a case of a two-track approach employing dialogue and a stern response to the North\u2019s provocations and nuclear development.The most crucial virtues for a country\u2019s external policy, particularly when dealing with an unpredictable partner, should be caution and prudence, as international relations pundits routinely say. These virtues should not be missing in the implementation of Seoul\u2019s policy toward Pyongyang.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","240":"South Korea called on North Korea Wednesday to end its insults against President Park Geun-hye as the North slammed her for condemning the North's decision to push back its standard time by 30 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Park expressed deep regret Monday over Pyongyang's unilateral move to push its clocks back a half-hour starting Liberation Day, which falls on Saturday.

(Yonhap)The court did not rule out the possibility that the Sri Lankan raped her alone or with accomplices, given that the man\u2019s sperm was found on the underwear of the victim, named Chung Eun-hye. But even if the Sri Lankan committed the crime, he cannot be punished due to the expiration of the 10-year statute of limitations, the court added. The Sri Lankan was suspected of taking Chung, who was intoxicated and on her way home from university, to an expressway overpass in Daegu to rape and rob her there with two others in October 1998.The two suspected Sri Lankan accomplices to the crime returned to their country in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Chung died after being hit by a 25-ton truck. At the time, the police had obtained her underwear some 30 meters away from the scene, but concluded the case as only a death by car accident. The police reopened the probe in 2011 after it found that the Sri Lankan\u2019s DNA matched the semen found on Chung\u2019s underwear. The DNA result came after the Sri Lankan was arrested in a separate prostitution-related case.

The plan, in that case, will be confirmed early next month after at least 20 days of notice.National textbooks, if so, will go into use from the 2017 school year in middle and high schools across the country, abolishing the current publication system six years after it was fully introduced.

The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases encouraged foreigners to receive five vaccines -- Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, MMR, chicken pox and DTaP, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough. This is the first time Korean doctors have released a list of recommended vaccines for the growing number of expat residents here. As of this year, more than 32 million foreigners have either entered or left Korea while over 1.7 million are residing in the country.The move also came after the Middle East respiratory syndrome recently hit the country, infecting nearly 190 people and killing 35. Korea has had the second-largest number of MERS cases after Saudi Arabia, the originating country. On Thursday, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a nationwide Japanese encephalitis warning as over 500 mosquitoes carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus were found in Busan. The health agency issued the advisory once the Japanese encephalitis virus-borne mosquito was spotted. The alert level will be raised if over 500 mosquitoes are detected in 30 regions across the country or a case of infection is officially reported. This year, the advisory was raised in April. Since 2005, 114 Japanese encephalitis cases have been confirmed, with 26 reported last year. While 95 percent of the cases do not show disease symptoms, some can have fever, headache, diarrhea or even fall into a coma, the authorities said.Free Japanese encephalitis vaccines are available at public health offices for children aged 1 to 12.The number of hepatitis A cases has sharply decreased in the country since the 1970s, but started to rebound in the 2000s.

The government confirmed the plan despite vocal opposition from both the labor and management blocs. The nation\u2019s two largest trade unions -- the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions -- filed an appeal to the Labor Ministry, claiming it is not enough to boost low-income earners\u2019 quality of life. The employers\u2019 representatives, for their part, also raised objections, asking the ministry to reconsider the \u201cdrastic\u201d hike that could deal a blow to small and medium-sized companies. The labor ministry, however, refused to accept their pleas, pushing for the hike proposed by the Minimum Wage Council.The council also agreed to stipulate hourly and monthly wages in the employment contract to endorse workers\u2019 rights to be paid for a day off work when working 40 hours a week. Currently, only hourly wages are written in the contract, which labor experts and laborers in the council saw as encouraging employers to dodge legal obligations to give staff members paid holidays. In response to concerns over the growing number of underpaid workers here, the government vowed to ramp up its crackdown on businesses failing to pay their staff the minimum wage. It plans to impose a financial penalty on lawbreakers on the spot to more effectively induce them to abide by the law. The relevant bill is held up at the National Assembly, it said. Nearly 15 percent of salaried workers in South Korea are paid the legal minimum wage or less as of 2013, the highest rate among OECD member countries, according to a recent study. The labor unions have lashed out at the government for its poor enforcement of the law.Talks among labor, management and experts collapsed several times due to continued clashes over the extent of the hike, failing to meet a June 29 legal deadline. The negotiations came to an end on July 9, when employers and labor experts put to vote the increase plan. The labor representatives in the council boycotted the vote in protest. The labor unions initially demanded a 79 percent rise to 10,000 won, arguing that the hike would curb the nation\u2019s income inequality and spur consumer spending. Business leaders, on the other hand, campaigned for a freeze, citing possible job losses and soaring production costs, especially for smaller companies. Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began in early June.By Ock Hyun-ju\u00a0(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","262":"South Korean historians Wednesday called on Japan to swiftly resolve the issue of its wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, as South Korea prepares to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its independence from Japanese colonial rule.More than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese soldiers during World War II, according to historians.Several Japanese politicians, most notably former Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono and former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in the 1990s, have made statements admitting to Japan's war crimes and apologized. But these statements have been overturned by their successors, including the current prime minister, Shinzo Abe.The Annual Conference on Historical Studies in Korea said Japan must clearly state its intent to inherit its two previous statements of apology -- the 1993 Kono and the 1995 Murayama statements.\"The Japanese government must no longer deny or distort the truth and immediately issue a heartfelt apology and compensate the victims,\" the coalition of 20 historical societies said in a statement. \"South Korea and Japan must strive to reach an agreement before any more victims pass away.\"Only 238 of these \"comfort women\" have been registered with the South Korean government, with 48 of them remaining alive.Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910-45 before Japan's World War II defeat ended the occupation.

In July, the North threatened to cancel the trip, citing South Korea's alleged provocations.Lee is the widow of former President Kim Dae-jung, who held the first inter-Korean summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of current leader Kim Jong-un, in 2000.

Middle and high schools then can choose any of the eight publishers' textbooks.Hwang said the government could set up a body to publish Korean history textbooks for middle and high school students, if necessary.The body would select the writers of the history textbooks and a separate deliberation committee would review their contents to see if they are fit to print, according to the Education Ministry.Hwang's comments underscored the government's efforts to forge a common understanding of history in a country where people are divided along ideological lines on the subject, especially recent history.At issue are certain omissions in some of the eight history textbooks on topics, such as the 1950-53 Korean War. Some of the history textbooks did not mention the killings of civilians by North Korean soldiers while stating similar killings by South Korean and U.S. troops, said Kim Yeon-seok, a ministry official handling the matter.The government plans to decide by September whether to set up the body responsible for the publication of Korean history textbooks.The government was in charge of publishing history textbooks from 1973 to 2009.

Last week, the country declared a de facto end to the outbreak that killed 36.Calls had been mounting for Park to apologize and to replace incumbent Moon, a former scholar on pension system, saying he lacked leadership while dealing with the virus spread. The government has been under fire for concealing information of MERS-infected patients and the hospitals where they were admitted and treated. The health ministry had rejected calls to disclose names of MERS-hit hospitals, stressing that it would paralyze the nation\u2019s medical sector.\u00a0Authorities later revealed the names and routes patients traveled. But its belated revelation sparked public anger, with many blaming the government\u2019s slow response for aggravating the spread of the disease.Min also said that the president will deliver a public address on Thursday to present her vision on state affairs.It was not immediately known whether Park will apologize to the public for the government\u2019s slow initial response.Cheong Wa Dae had admitted last month that the government\u2019s response to the outbreak was \u201cinsufficient,\u201d but no official apology has been made so far.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","268":"South Korea's antitrust watchdog slapped a combined 32.9 billion won ($28.1 million) fine on 17 local builders Tuesday for rigging bids for large public infrastructure projects.According to the Fair Trade Commission, the companies worked together to fix costs on five projects that prevented open competition and broke the country's fair trade rules.The FTC handed out 12.99 billion won in fines to Daelim Industrial Co., POSCO E&C; and Samwhan Corp., which rigged the 2008 bidding for a section of expansion work on a highway.The three companies have also been ordered to halt such practices in the future.

According to the study, day care centers on average close at 7:29 p.m., and 28.1 percent of the surveyed institutions offered programs even after their regular closing hours. Kindergartens, in comparison, mostly ran from 8:45 a.m. until 2:15 p.m.Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon visits a day care center located inside an industrial complex in Seoul to spend time with children. The Labor Ministry recently announced its plan to establish more day care centers at industrial complexes to support children of factory workers, as well as to guarantee contract workers\u2018 rights to parental leaves. (Yonhap)While day care centers offer early morning classes as well as late-evening programs, kindergartens are more popular among parents with children aged 4-5, according to government statistics. Last year, 278,000 children aged 5 attended kindergartens, while only 162,000 children of the same age were placed in day care centers.Kim Eun-seol, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said this is because kindergartens offer programs that are more educational, while day care centers\u2019 programs tend to focus more on nurturing and basic care. \u201cParents of children aged 4-5 prefer kindergartens because they want their kids to be prepared academically before entering elementary school when they turn six,\u201d Kim told The Korea Herald. All kindergartens nationwide are regulated by Korea\u2019s Ministry of Education, and therefore all of its teachers are required to have university or college degrees in early childhood education. Day care centers, on the other hand, are regulated by the Welfare Ministry. The minimum qualification to become a day care center worker is a high school diploma. According to Kim\u2019s study, kindergarten teachers on average make about 1 million won ($857) more than day care workers monthly. The average monthly salary of kindergarten teachers was 2.74 million won, while that of day care workers was 1.81 million won. Tuition fees for private kindergartens are generally higher than at private day care centers.\u00a0While high earning\u00a0dual-income households\u00a0have the option of hiring a nanny to drop off and pick up their children at kindergartens and even look after them at home,\u00a0low-earning parents are often left with the sole option of having their children at day care centers\u00a0up to\u00a0more than 14 hours a day.\u201cBut it\u2019s over-generalizing to say kindergartens are better than day care centers,\u201d researcher Kim said. \u201cThere are so many kinds of day care centers. Some of them are public, while some of them are private. The quality of the programs as well as the teaching staff are all different by each and every institution. I think day care centers can be a great option for working parents as long as they find the right ones that fit their children\u2019s needs.\u201dKim\u2019s study also found that workers and teachers at public institutions -- both kindergartens and day care centers -- work significantly fewer hours but are paid more than those who work at private institutions.For example, teachers at public kindergartens on average worked 8 hours and 35 minutes daily, while those at private kindergartens worked 10 hours and 23 minutes each day. Teachers who have worked at public kindergartens for at least eight years were making 3.36 million won monthly as of last year, while those at private kindergartens with the same work experience were making 2.07 million won.Day care center workers were making less than kindergarten teachers, with 2.14 million won every month for those in public and 1.42 million won for those at private ones.A day care center employee who wanted to remain anonymous said if she had kids of her own in the future, she would choose to send them to kindergartens. Having a degree in early childhood education, she had worked as a teacher at a private kindergarten before taking her current position at a public day care center. \u201cI\u2019m not saying day care centers are bad. The one I\u2019m working at offers decent educational programs on top of the nursery care,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having to work long hours at day care centers makes it difficult for the staff to plan their classes ahead of time. At kindergartens, where classes end early, it\u2019s relatively easier for teachers to think about what they want to do the next day and put extra effort into the curriculum.\u201dYoon Ji-young, a working mother, sent both of her children -- now seven and 11 -- to kindergartens. Yoon said she was only able to so because her mother-in-law helps with child care at home. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t very comfortable with the idea of my kids spending too much time at a day care center,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they are going to play (than attend some kind of educational program), I thought it was much better to do it at home instead, with their sibling and grandmother than at an institution. But I think I wouldn\u2019t have had the choice but to send my kids to day care centers if my mother-in-law\u2019s help wasn\u2019t available.\u201dBy Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","270":"A Japanese opposition leader vowed Monday to make efforts to develop the Seoul-Tokyo relationship into a future-oriented one in a landmark year, despite many challenges such as tension over their shared history.Katsuya Okada, leader of Japan's opposition Democratic Party, made the remarks in his meeting in Seoul with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.

The practice, carried out in the 2005-2013 period, has been cited for directly impacting profits of existing special agent stores. The antitrust watchdog said such actions constituted an abuse of superior position enjoyed by AmorePacific vis-a-vis its special agent. The FTC ordered administrative corrections, slapped a 500 million won ($428,000) fine and referred the company and a key executive to the state prosecutors' office.Special agent stores, which only sell AmorePacific products under contract, account for some 20 percent of the cosmetic company's domestic sales and use its sales personnel to sell high end products such as Sulwhasoo.Sources said the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is looking into possible wrongdoing by AmorePacific and one of its former directing managers, who has only been identified by his surname Lee.The FTC claimed that Lee was directly involved in the reallocation of sale personnel and even called for the replacement of special agent stores that were underperforming.\"We are carefully looking into all allegations made and records provided by the FTC,\" said an insider at the prosecutors' office.He said that Lee will be summoned for questioning in due course.The FTC said taking firm stance against unfair trade practices will send a clear signal to the business community that the government will clamp down on big companies that abuse their power to hurt its agents and dealers.

Investigators were looking into the case, securing phone records between the two and the footage of surveillance cameras showing the two entering the hotel on June 13.The woman, however, has reportedly changed her statements, saying that she didn\u2018t try to stop him with all her strength. She said she doesn\u2019t want him to be prosecuted, according to reports.Despite the lawmaker\u2019s claims, the police said he had not been cleared of the charges and they would decide whether to question the two later on.\u201cWe are handling the matter very carefully,\u201d said an official at the Daegu Police Agency.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","276":"Last year, Lee Ji-hyang, a South Korean manicurist, flew to Vietnam for a new challenge. She signed up to teach women job seekers in Quang Nam, a province in Vietnam\u2019s South Central Coast region, as part of Korea\u2019s assistance program for developing countries.\u201cI trained about 40 women who wished to be manicurists for about a month,\u201d Lee told The Korea Herald. \u201cI had an interpreter with me throughout all of the classes, but sometimes I didn\u2019t really need to explain anything verbally because they already knew what to do. They were all very determined.\u201dIronically, labor policies for women hasn\u2019t been Seoul\u2019s forte; Korea has the highest wage gap by gender among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. The employment rate for women in Korea in 2013, which stood at 53.9 percent, was in fact much lower than that in Vietnam in the same year -- 72 percent.\u00a0According to a report last year by the World Economic Forum, Korea ranked 117th out of 142 countries on gender parity, below all of the OECD nations except Turkey.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vietnamese female job seekers learn makeup skills in a job training center run and financed by Korea\u2019s Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family). Regardless, its gender equality project in Vietnam -- which mainly consists of offering job training programs for unemployed women -- has benefitted some 2,972 Vietnamese women since 2011 in hopes of offering more specialized fields of jobs. Among the women who received free job training, 1,239 were employed as manicurists, makeup artists and even started their own businesses as handicraft artists. \u201cThe second largest number of women immigrants residing in Korea are from Vietnam, following those from China,\u201d said Oh Min-ok from the ministry in Seoul. \u201cThis certainly has played as one of the factors when we made our decision to launch this project there.\u201dKorea\u2019s Gender Equality Ministry currently runs and supports three job training centers in three different regions in Vietnam -- Quang Nam, Thai Binh and Can Tho. Starting this August, the centers are introducing new classes with different skills, including graphic design, retail strategy and cleaning. Textbooks gathering the centers\u2019 four years of work will be published as well. All of the courses are either taught by Koreans who are experts in the specific job skills, including makeup or nail care, or locals who have been trained by Koreans to teach the classes. \u201cAll of the three centers are located in relatively remote regions. We are dealing with women who are not living in the cities and don\u2019t have a lot of resources when seeking employment,\u201d said Huh Hye-young, who currently works in Vietnam at the centers. She has been serving there since 2012.\u201cMany of them work in farms owned by their families, but they are often out of work when there is no help needed. The purpose is to train them with skills that can eventually lead to possible employment, regardless of where they live.\u201dOne of the most popular classes has been nail art training. Because of Vietnam\u2019s warm weather, manicure and pedicure services are becoming increasingly popular in the country, according to Huh. Although all of the training programs offered at the centers are free, not everyone who wishes to participate can take the classes. Every applicant has to go through an interview process in order to be selected. \u201cOnce, too many applied to take classes on nail art, so only about 50 percent of those who signed up were selected to participate,\u201d said Huh.In spite of its high labor force participation rate of women, Vietnam was one of the few countries in the world where the gender pay gap actually widened in 2012-2013, according to International Labor Organization reports. Korea\u2019s gender pay gap also still stands high, higher than the one in Vietnam. Korean women were paid 37.4 percent less than their male counterparts in 2012, while Vietnamese women made about 20 to 30 percent less than men in 2013.Studies by the World Bank show that women\u2019s high employment participation in lower income countries derives from the fact that individuals cannot survive without working. The quality of the women\u2019s work, therefore, usually remains poor, as they are often hired by their own family members for agricultural work, and are often unpaid for their labor.On the other hand, the reports pointed out that developed nations with high labor participation rate of women have extensive social protection coverage and are societies where part-time work is possible and accepted. Korea is also striving to reach such a level, as the country is still without a state-run unemployment assistance program and has among the longest work hours of the OECD nations. Most temporary workers are also not entitled to full-time benefits.Manicurist Lee said skills are what can lead to a woman\u2019s independence, which also leads to dignity. Among students at the centers was Nguyen Thi Thau, a 29-year-old with a speech impairment, who had been struggling with job prospects because of her disability. After completing her courses in nail art, which she excelled in, she was soon hired by a local beauty salon.\u201cMany of the women I taught are also working as home-visiting manicurists,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you have the skills you need, you can still work even if you don\u2019t have the money to start your own salon, or be employed by someone else. It gives you something that you can start with, even if you don\u2019t have a lot of resources or opportunities. Then you don\u2019t need to rely on somebody else. That\u2019s why I found my experience in Vietnam rewarding.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","277":"North Korea has notified the France-based organizer of an international military sports event of its decision not to attend an event to be held in South Korea's central city of Mungyeong in October, the defense ministry said Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0 In a letter sent to the Conseil International du Sport Militaire on Friday, North Korea's sports education committee said it will not attend the 2015 CISM World Games Korea, according to the Ministry of National Defense. \u00a0\u00a0 The reason for the absence was not elaborated upon, it said. \u00a0\u00a0 The world military sports event is scheduled for a 10-day run from Oct. 2 in Mungyeong, about 250 kilometers southeast of Seoul, and nearby cities.\u00a0\u00a0 The strained inter-Korean relations are believed to be keeping the North from joining South Korea-hosted global events.\u00a0\u00a0 Seoul earlier officially invited the North to send a vice defense minister to the Seoul Defense Dialogue set for September in the capitol city, only to be rejected by Pyongyang.\u00a0 \"We hoped that the military sports event could become an opportunity to untangle the worsened South-North relations, but it fell through regretfully,\" a defense ministry official said, asking not to be named. \"We call on the North to come to the inter-Korean talks our government has proposed.\" \u00a0\u00a0 So far, a total of 5,440 soldiers from 72 foreign countries have signed up for the upcoming sports event, including China, Russia, England, Germany, France and Myanmar, while 37 more countries are planning to join, according to the ministry.\u00a0\u00a0 North Korea and 39 other countries including Libya, Afghanistan, Laos and Mexico, have rejected their invitations.

Lim Hyeon-soo (Rim Hyon-su), 60, of Light Korean Presbyterian Church near Toronto was detained after entering the North via China on a humanitarian mission in late January.Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency accused him of acting as \"a servant of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet group.\"\"He malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership and social system of the DPRK and resorted to subversive plots and activities in a sinister bid to build a religious state in the DPRK while frequenting it under the guise of 'humanitarian aid' and 'free donation' over the past 18 years,\" KCNA said.\"He confessed to all his crimes in the course of the investigation by the competent organ,\" it said.KCNA quoted the pastor as saying that he delivered a \"report on what is going on in North Korea before tens of thousands of South Koreans and overseas Koreans at a sermon on Sundays at my church and during preaching tours of more than 20 countries including Canada, the U.S., south Korea, Japan and Brazil.\" \"Each time I malignantly slandered the dignity and social system of the DPRK,\" he was quoted as saying.The pastor also confessed that he met with the U.S. ambassador to Mongolia in 1996 and discussed the issue of helping more than 500 North Korean defectors go to South Korea via Mongolia every year, according to KCNA.He also told the news conference that he received a GPS device from a Korean American named Dennis Kim and handed it to a Korean Chinese broker helping North Koreans defect from their communist homeland, KCNA said.The Unification Ministry said that it is \"improper\" for North Korea to detain the pastor for charges of what the North calls \"subversive plots.\"\"In terms of four South Korean nationals detained in the North, it is not easy to figure out their whereabouts,\" Jeong Joon-hee, the ministry spokesman, said in a regular press briefing on Friday.\"The government is making efforts via diplomatic channel.\"Seoul has called on Pyongyang to set free the four South Koreans detained in North Korea including a New York University student and missionary Kim Jung-wook.Christian missionaries have often been detained in the North.Kenneth Bae, one such missionary, was released in November after about two years of detention in the communist nation. Bae, who entered the North in late 2012, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for unspecified anti-state crimes.

The joint drills, set for Aug. 20-28, come as China and Russia have deepened their cooperation in the military and security fields. The planned military exercises are \"to further enhance their capabilities of jointly coping with maritime security threats,\" Chinese defense ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said in a statement posted on its website on late Thursday. The drills will be held \"in the Peter the Great Gulf and the areas off the coast of the Clerk Cape, as well as in the airspace and waters of the Sea of Japan,\" Yang said, using the Japanese reference of the East Sea. The Peter the Great Gulf is the biggest gulf of the East Sea and is close to the borders of North Korea, China and Russia. About seven Chinese warships and aircraft will join the nine-day drills, Yang said.

But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Such efforts have intensified after the nationalist Abe came to power.Abe's upcoming statement will be watched closely as it is considered a second chance for him to resolve historical tensions with South Korea after failing to do so during his U.S. visit in April.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

(Yonhap)","283":"Nearly simultaneous explosions targeted a Turkish peace rally Saturday in Ankara, killing at least 95 people and wounding hundreds in Turkey\u2019s deadliest attack in years _ one that threatens to inflame the nation\u2019s ethnic tensions. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said there were \u201cstrong signs\u201d that the two explosions _ which struck 50 meters (yards) apart just after 10 a.m. _ were suicide bombings. He suggested that Kurdish rebels or Islamic State group militants were to blame.The two explosions occurred seconds apart outside the capital\u2019s main train station as hundreds of opposition supporters and Kurdish activists gathered for the peace rally organized by Turkey\u2019s public workers\u2019 union and other groups. The protesters planned to call for increased democracy in Turkey and an end to the renewed violence between Kurdish rebels and Turkish security forces. The attacks Saturday came at a tense time for Turkey, a NATO member that borders war-torn Syria, hosts more refugees than any other nation in the world and has seen renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels that has left hundreds dead in the last few months. Many people at the rally had been anticipating that the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, would declare a temporary cease-fire _ which it did hours after the bombing _ to ensure that Turkey\u2019s Nov. 1 election would be held in a safe environment.Television footage from Turkey\u2019s Dogan news agency showed a line of protesters Saturday near Ankara\u2019s train station, chanting and performing a traditional dance with their hands locked when a large explosion went off behind them. An Associated Press photographer saw several bodies covered with bloodied flags and banners that demonstrators had brought for the rally. \u201cThere was a massacre in the middle of Ankara,\u201d said Lami Ozgen, head of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions, or KESK.\u00a0 The state-run Anadolu Agency said the attacks were carried out with TNT explosives fortified with metal ball-bearings.Turkey\u2019s government late Saturday raised the death toll in the twin bomb blasts to 95 people killed, 248 wounded. It said 48 of the wounded were in serious condition.Selcuk Atalay of the Turkish Medical Association\u2019s Ankara branch put the death toll at at least 97 and feared the toll could rise even higher, since several of the wounded were in serious condition with burns. (Yonhap)\u201cThis massacre targeting a pro-Kurdish but mostly Turkish crowd could flame ethnic tensions in Turkey,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst at the Washington Institute.Cagaptay said the attack could be the work of groups \u201choping to induce the PKK, or its more radical youth elements, to continue fighting Turkey,\u201d adding that the Islamic State group would benefit most from the full-blown Turkey-PKK conflict.\u201c(That) development could make ISIS a secondary concern in the eyes of many Turks to the PKK,\u201d Cagaptay said in emailed comments, using another acronym for IS militants.Small anti-government protests broke out at the scene of the explosions and outside Ankara hospitals as Interior Minister Selami Altinok visited the wounded. Some demonstrators chanted \u201cMurderer Erdogan!\u201d _ referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many accuse of increasing tensions with Kurds to profit at the ballot box in November. Erdogan denies the accusations.Later Saturday, thousands gathered near Istanbul\u2019s main square denouncing the attacks and also holding the government responsible.The Turkish government imposed a temporary news blackout covering images that showed the moment of the blasts, gruesome or bloody pictures or \u201cimages that create a feeling of panic.\u201d A spokesman warned media organizations they could face a \u201cfull blackout\u201d if they did not comply.Many people reported being unable to access Twitter and other social media websites for several hours after the blasts. It was not clear if authorities had blocked access to the websites, but Turkey often does impose blackouts following attacks.At a news conference, Davutoglu declared a three-day official mourning period for the blast victims and said Turkey had been warned about groups aiming to destabilize the country. \u201cFor some time, we have been receiving intelligence information based from some (Kurdish rebel) and Daesh statements that certain suicide attackers would be sent to Turkey... and that through these attackers chaos would be created in Turkey,\u201d Davutoglu told reporters, using the IS group\u2019s Arabic acronym.\u201cThe (Kurdish rebels) or Daesh could emerge (as culprits) of today\u2019s terror event,\u201d Davutoglu said, promising that those behind the attacks would be caught and punished.Davutoglu said authorities had detained at least two suspected would-be suicide bombers in the past three days in Ankara and Istanbul. Authorities had been on alert after Turkey agreed to take a more active role in the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State group. Turkey opened up its bases to U.S. aircraft to launch air raids on the extremist group in Syria and carried out a limited number of strikes on the group itself. Russia has also entered the fray on behalf of the Syrian government recently, bombing sites in Syria and reportedly violating Turkish airspace a few times in the past week.On a separate front, the fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels flared anew in July, killing at least 150 police and soldiers and hundreds of PKK rebels since then. Turkish jets have also carried out numerous deadly airstrikes on Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq.\u00a0 Erdogan condemned Saturday\u2019s attacks, which he said targeted the country\u2019s unity, called for solidarity and canceled a planned visit Monday to Turkmenistan.\u201cThe greatest and most meaningful response to this attack is the solidarity and determination we will show against it,\u201d Erdogan said.President Barack Obama offered condolences to Erdogan in a phone call Saturday. The White House said in a statement that Obama affirmed that the U.S. will stand with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. Critics have accused Erdogan of re-igniting the fighting with the Kurds to seek electoral gains _ hoping that the turmoil would rally voters back to the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP.\u00a0 Electoral gains by the country\u2019s pro-Kurdish party caused the AKP, founded by Erdogan, to lose its parliamentary majority in a June election after a decade of single-party rule. The attacks Saturday, which even surpassed twin al-Qaida-linked attacks in Istanbul in 2003 that killed some 60 people, also drew widespread condemnation from Turkey\u2019s allies.Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency said President Barack Obama called Erdogan to extend his condolences. The Anadolu Agency, citing unnamed officials, said Obama told Erdogan the United States would continue to side with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. It quoted Obama as saying the U.S. \u201cshared Turkey\u2019s grief.\u201dErdogan earlier said the twin bombings aimed to destroy Turkey\u2019s \u201cpeace and stability.\u201d Anadolu said the two leaders agreed to talk more in the coming days.German Chancellor Angela Merkel sent her condolences, calling the attacks \u201cparticularly cowardly acts that were aimed directly at civil rights, democracy and peace.\u201d \u201cIt is an attempt at intimidation and an attempt to spread fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI am convinced that the Turkish government and all of Turkish society stands together at this time with a response of unity and democracy.\u201dNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said \u201cthere can be no justification for such a horrendous attack on people marching for peace... All NATO allies stand united in the fight against the scourge of terrorism.\u201dSaturday was the third attack against meetings of Kurdish activists. In July, a suicide bombing blamed on the Islamic State group killed 33 peace activists, including many Kurds, in the town of Suruc near Turkey\u2019s border with Syria. Two people were killed in June in a bomb attack at the pro-Kurdish party\u2019s election rally.\u201cThis attack (Saturday) resembles and is a continuation of the Diyarbakir and Suruc (attacks),\u201d said Selahattin Demirtas, leader of the Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish party.\u00a0 He held Erdogan and Davutoglu\u2019s government responsible for the latest attack, saying it was \u201ccarried out by the state against the people.\u201dIn the aftermath of the Ankara attack, the PKK declared a temporary cease-fire. A rebel statement said Saturday the group is halting hostilities to allow the Nov. 1 election to proceed safely. It said it would not launch attacks but would defend itself.The government has said there would be no letup in its fight against the Kurdish rebels.\u201cOur operations (against the PKK) will continue until they lay down arms,\u201d Davutoglu said late Friday.

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media.Missile exports have long been a major source of hard currency for North Korea.\"North Korea has sold missiles to Yemen and sent missile engineers to that country in the 1990s,\" said a former North Korean official, who was in a position to know about the arms deals.Another former North Korean intelligence official in Seoul said North Korea sold many Scud missiles to countries in the Middle East, noting Egypt was the hub of North Korea's arms trade in the region.The two former North Korean officials, who later defected to South Korea, asked not to be identified, citing the issue's sensitivity.North Korea's Scud-B missiles and Scud-C missiles have a range of 300 kilometers and 500 kilometers, respectively, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.(Yonhap)","285":"Two South Korean victims of Japan\u2019s wartime sex slavery Tuesday filed a defamation suit against the Japanese government and companies with a U.S. court, demanding an apology and compensation for insulting them by labeling them prostitutes.The victims, including Yoo Hee-nam, 87, lodged a civil suit at a federal court in San Francisco against the Japanese government, the late Japanese Emperor Hirohito, former Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and seven Japanese companies, including Mitsui and Mitsubishi, their lawyer said. The victims have demanded $20 million in punitive damages each, for the wartime atrocities committed by Japan and its firms, and also for their continued denial of forcing South Korean women into sexual enslavement.\u201cThe Japanese government is practically insulting those victims by calling them voluntary prostitutes,\u201d said Kim Hyung-jin, a lawyer for the victims, at a news conference held in Washington. \u201cIt is like calling the prisoners in Auschwitz as \u2018voluntary workers,\u2019\u201d he said.The victims are among a dozen Korean victims who had announced in June that they would take Japan to court in the U.S. if Tokyo did not make a sincere apology by the end of that month.U.S. lawmaker Mike Honda (left), a longtime supporter of the victims of Japan\u2019s wartime sexual enslavement, and Lee Yong-su, one of the Korean victims, hug at a ceremony to mark the eighth anniversary of the passage of a U.S. congressional resolution on former sex slaves, in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington on Tuesday. (Yonhap)They planned to take legal action in the U.S. because their previous attempts to make Japan apologize failed in South Korea and Japan. Victims have won similar cases in Seoul, but South Korean courts have no execution power to force Japan to deliver an apology or provide compensation. Also, they can hardly win the case in Tokyo, the lawyer told a local newspaper. Though the U.S. court has no jurisdiction over crimes committed by Japan, the suit in itself has significance as they were illegal acts against humanity that goes beyond jurisdiction or statute of limitation, the lawyer had explained.The legal case was filed at a court in California on the same day U.S. lawmakers marked the eighth anniversary of a landmark 2007 House of Representatives resolution urging Japan to acknowledge and take responsibility for its atrocities committed during the World War II.On the 8th anniversary of the landmark resolution, Rep, Mike Honda urged Japan to learn from Germany by institutionalizing a legal tool that makes it a crime to deny wartime historical facts.\u201cWe know that German Chancellor Merkel has told Abe when he visited Germany, \u2018You know, we faced our past and we made our apologies. In fact, I think we even have a law in Germany that if you say that the death camps did not exist, you will be fined for a violation of a law there,\u2019\u201d he said during an event held to mark the resolutions anniversary.During a weeklong visit to the U.S. in April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to apologize to victims of Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities.The Japanese leader is expected to issue another statement next month to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\u201cPrime Minister Abe has the historic opportunity to take leadership and doing something and saying, \u2018You are right. We were wrong. We apologize. We will pass a law that says our textbooks will teach our youngsters what happened in the past so it won\u2019t happen in the future,\u2019\u201d said Honda.U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also said Abe should make a clearer statement on the country\u2019s sexual slavery of women during the war. In a meeting with South Korean lawmakers, Pelosi said she regrets that Abe has not made a clear statement on the issue, according to Rep. Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee.

Their marriage, however, reportedly was not permitted according to the tradition of their country as they came from two different tribes. Both sides of their families began to threaten them, to a degree at which the couple were forced to go in hiding, the reports said.One of the couple, who had been residing in Korea for job opportunities, eventually filed for refugee status in 2012, saying they could be murdered by their families if they returned home, and that the Pakistani government could not provide them any protection.But the immigration office turned down the request the following year, saying there was not enough basis to deem that the couple was suffering from fear on grounds that they could be subject to persecution based on the refugee convention, and that their problem involved family objections.The 1951 Refugee Convention states that a refugee is someone who, \u201cowing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u201dThe court also sided with immigration, saying that the couple\u2019s case did not fulfill the refugee conditions and the Pakistani system had due process against crimes.","287":"The ruling Saenuri Party Leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung set out to consolidate his conservative base during his trip to the U.S. in the past week, unleashing remarks that appeal to conservative voters as he sought to solidify his growing popularity at home as a presidential hopeful.In his first-ever trip to Washington as the Saenuri Party leader, Kim devoted most of his schedule to highlighting the significance of the Korean-U.S. alliance and paying tribute to the Korean War veterans, while expressing caution against progressives who, in his words, threaten Korea.\u00a0The ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung kneels down and bows his head to the grave of Gen. Walker, the first commander of U.S. 8th Army during the Korean War.(Yonhap)\u201cI understand there is concern here in Washington that Korea is getting closer with China than the U.S. We must not forget that the U.S. is our sole alliance that is irreplaceable and indelible,\u201d Kim said Monday in a meeting with reporters in Washington. \u201cI am afraid that some progressives might hijack the future of Korea. I can\u2019t even fathom what Korea would be like if she had followed progressives to choose communism. Our party will do its best to prevent that from happening by winning an election,\u201d said Kim in a separate meeting with Koreans who reside in the U.S.Kim wasted no time in showing respect to those who fought during the Korean War. Dubbed as \u201cdeep-bow diplomacy\u201d by Korea\u2019s media outlets, Kim kowtowed to the war veterans and thanked them for coming to fight for \u201cthe country that has never been known,\u201d adding, \u201cWe owe you a great deal.\u201d Kim\u2019s move is widely seen as an attempt to rile conservative supporters in the run-up to the 2015 general election and 2017 presidential election, as he leads in the latest poll that surveyed the most likely next president, analysts said. Korea\u2019s pollster Realmeter showed Monday that Kim garnered 24 percent of support among voters, outpacing other political heavyweights such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Moon Jae-in and former NPAD leader Ahn Cheol-soo.\u00a0\u201c(Kim\u2019s remark) is designed for his presidential bid,\u201d said Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University in Seoul. \u201cConsidering his position in the party, I think he made such comments to appeal to conservative voters,\u201d Chung said.Rep. Kim Moo-sung. (Yonhap)\u00a0Other experts assessed Kim\u2019s move as a step to reinforce his position as a conservative party leader until the next presidential election, by thrusting support to President Park Geun-hye\u2019s conservative foreign policy that focuses on the Korea-U.S. alliance. \u201cGiven that Korea\u2019s political landscape is somewhat leaning toward conservatism, Kim\u2019s kowtow to the U.S veterans is more likely to be one to the conservative voters. Obviously, Kim is the most popular figure among conservative politicians,\u201d said Choi Jin, chairman of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.\u201cWhether he wants it or not, Kim would emerge as a strong candidate as President Park\u2019s term nears its end. In the meantime, I think he will seek to gain ground by giving remarks that echo the president\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Choi said.In true politician style, Kim for the time being dismissed speculation that his trip was in anticipation of a future presidential bid. \u201cThe trip is a part of the party\u2019s diplomacy plan. The relationship with the U.S. is the most politically important issue. That is why the trip was arranged,\u201d Kim told reporters last Saturday before getting on a plane to Washington.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","288":"Scud missiles fired into Saudi Arabia by Yemeni rebels in recent months came from North Korea, a South Korean intelligence official said Wednesday.Saudi Arabia has shot down about 40 percent of some 20 Scud missiles fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels, said the official, who is familiar with the issue.He did not give further details on how South Korea reached the conclusion that the missiles originated from North Korea. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media.North Korea is believed to have exported its missiles to some countries in the Middle East as part of its efforts to earn hard currency.\"North Korea has sold missiles to Yemen and sent missile engineers to that country in the 1990s,\" said a former North Korean official, who was in a position to know about the arms deals.

High Commissioner for Human Rights opened a field office in Seoul to monitor and document human rights violations in the North, to which Pyongyang responded with threats of war. In protest, it boycotted the Summer Universiade held in South Korea earlier this month.North Korea claims the human rights allegations are part of a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.The two Koreas held foreign ministerial talks at ARF meetings in 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2007, after which there were only brief encounters between the ministers in 2008 and 2011.Aside from a possible meeting between the Koreas, the ARF gathering will also be watched closely for other bilateral meetings, such as between North Korea and China.Relations between Pyongyang and Beijing have soured over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, which Pyongyang has continued to develop despite opposition from its biggest ally and benefactor.South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly called on China to play a bigger role in reining in North Korea's nuclear program.Those calls have grown since the U.S. and other world powers struck a deal with Iran earlier this month to curb its uranium enrichment program in exchange for extensive sanctions relief.Hwang Joon-kook, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, told reporters Tuesday after meeting with officials in China last week that now is an \"important time where North Korea stands at a crossroads between completing its development of nuclear weapons and coming to the negotiating table to discuss its denuclearization.\" (Yonhap)","290":"U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should make a clearer statement on the country's wartime sexual enslavement of women, according to a South Korean lawmaker.Pelosi made the remark during a meeting with Rep. Kim Moo-sung, chairman of South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party and other party lawmakers, as Kim expressed gratitude for her role in passing a landmark 2007 House resolution on the issue, according to Rep. Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee.Tuesday marked the eighth anniversary of the resolution that urged Japan to formally acknowledge, apologize and accept historical responsibility for the atrocity in a clear and unequivocal manner.Kim asked Pelosi to pay greater attention to the issue, according to Na.Na said Pelosi asked her what message Abe should issue in the future, and she responded that the Japanese leader should make a message of apology on the 70th anniversary of World War II next month.Kim also met with Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel and asked the U.S. exercise its influence over Japan to make sure that Abe does not distort history in an upcoming statement he plans to issue next month to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II.Kim also stressed that Japan's distortion of history can never be acceptable.On growing relations with China, Kim told Russel that the strengthening ties with Beijing are based on the solid alliance with the U.S. Russel reaffirmed the strong U.S. commitment to South Korea's defense, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and unification of the two Koreas, according to participants in the meeting.Kim's delegation also met with Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Royce's office said in a statement that the two sides discussed the importance of the U.S.-Korea partnership, including Korea's interest in participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an envisioned free trade deal among 12 Asia-Pacific nations, including the U.S. and Japan.\"As a long-time supporter of a strong U.S.-South Korea relationship, I also discussed with Mr. Kim the importance of staying committed to remembering the terrible human rights abuses that occurred during World War II,\" Royce said in the statement, referring to the sexual slavery issue.\"I've long fought misguided efforts to minimize the suffering endured by hundreds of thousands of women at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army,\" he said.Kim had planned to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry, but the meeting did not happen as the top American diplomat was tied up with a Senate hearing on the recent landmark deal on Iran's nuclear program, officials said. (Yonhap)","291":"South Korea and the United States will conduct a joint on-site investigation of the U.S. Forces Korea's Osan Air Base next week over an accidental shipment of a live anthrax sample sent there in April, the Ministry of National Defense said Wednesday.A joint working group that was launched earlier this month to look into the delivery mishap will visit the biological laboratory inside the Osan base, south of Seoul, on Aug. 6 in order to \"personally verify and assess the overall process of the accident,\" the ministry said in a statement. The process of the anthrax sample's delivery and steps taken after the delivery, including the disposal of the sample, will be subject to the firsthand inspection, it said. The schedule of the on-site probe was confirmed in the first meeting of the joint working group held earlier in the day at the ministry in Seoul.The Pentagon said in May that live anthrax samples were accidentally sent from a military laboratory in Utah to other labs in the U.S. and several foreign countries in April, including the lab at the Osan Air Base.\u00a0(Yonhap)\"The on-site visit is expected to defuse public worries by having firsthand verification on whether actions have been taken properly on the concerned facility and those who have been exposed in accordance with the safety guidelines at home and abroad throughout the first shipment and to the disposal,\" the statement read. Anthrax is a lethal disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which is a toxic substance often used to produce biochemical weapons. In 2001, anthrax-laced letters were mailed to U.S. news media and Senate offices and killed five people.As part of next week's inspection, the group of people who handled the live sample in April will enter South Korea and perform a demonstration of how it was tested and disposed of then, the ministry noted.The joint working group will review law revisions aimed at preventing the recurrence of a similar accident and report the result to the joint Status of Forces Agreement committee in December, it noted, adding that it will also delve into ways to step up the allies' cooperation on defense against biochemical weapons, especially from North Korea. Amid growing public outcry over the inbound shipment of the lethal bacterium, the ministry vowed more fact-finding efforts last week, including the on-site probe of the military lab. (Yonhap)","292":"PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) \u2013 North Korea is holding what is expected to be one of its biggest celebrations ever Saturday for the 70th anniversary of its ruling party's creation, an attention-getting event that is the government's way of showing the world and its own people the Kim dynasty \u2013 now in its third generation \u2013 is firmly in control and its military a power to be reckoned with.As the clock struck midnight Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un marked the anniversary by paying respect to both his late father and grandfather at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA.The military parade kicking off the celebrations could hold some surprises for analysts abroad who will be watching its display of weaponry very closely, particularly North Korea's growing fleet of drone aircraft and long-range missiles.The guest list is shaping up to be less impressive.\u00a0 While no world leaders will be attending \u2013 North Korean ally China is sending a senior Communist Party official, not its head of state, or even vice premier \u2013 the normally isolated and quiet North Korean capital has been flooded by tourists, international media and delegations ranging from ethnic Koreans living abroad to obscure Russian and Mongolian groups dedicated to studying North Korea's political ideas.The military parade was expected to begin in the morning, but was being delayed, apparently due to heavy rain Friday night. Even by late morning, as a light rain fell, officials had not distributed a final schedule \u2013 which is unusual even in North Korea. Suggesting that the show will indeed go on, crowds of people carrying bouquets of plastic flowers could be seen streaming to Kim Il Sung Square, where the event will be held. Military vehicles or possibly floats shrouded in blue plastic tarps to protect them against the weather were parked in a long row on a bridge leading to the parade route.Even though North Korean officials did not divulge details of the day's plans, open-source satellite imagery has been monitoring large-scale troop activities at the Mirim military air base in Pyongyang, which has been rigged with a mock-up of Kim Il Sung Square. Masses of Pyongyang citizens have for weeks been out in public plazas across the city practicing their roles for a torchlight parade in the evening. For the finale, a stage has been set up on a river running through central Pyongyang for a late-night concert featuring North Korea's most popular musical group, the all-female Moranbong Band. Tickets for foreigners hoping to attend the concert were going for 100 euros ($114) a pop.The spectacle promises to be the most elaborate since Kim Jong Un assumed power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011, and the satellite imagery suggests the military parade could be the country's biggest ever.It's not known if Kim himself will speak at any of the day's events. Kim has yet to make a state visit abroad and although his visits to various farms and factories around the country are featured daily on North Korean news broadcasts, he rarely speaks at public events.Though military parades were out of fashion until about a decade ago, North Korea's leadership often uses anniversaries to rally the nation behind the military or the party, while at the same time reinforcing the primacy of the leader himself. On Friday, senior state officials led a mass gathering in Pyongyang singing the praises of the party and the leader.Also on Friday, Kim met with the Chinese delegation led by Liu Yunshan, the Communist Party's No. 5 leader, where Liu delivered a message by Chinese President Xi Jinping, KCNA said.China's official Xinhua News Agency reported that Liu told Kim that China was willing to work with North Korea for a quick resumption of six-party nuclear talks. The talks, which aim to end the North's nuclear program and also involve the U.S., South Korea, Russia and Japan, stalled seven years ago.Some foreign analysts believe the particularly strong emphasis this year on making the anniversary of the party's foundation such a lavish fete is a sign that Kim is trying to build up his own stature along with that of the party relative to the military. Though Kim's leadership and both institutions are strong, the power balance among various government organs in North Korea is a delicate one and maintaining that balance is a key to keeping Kim's regime solid and unchallenged.North Korea maintains its ``military-first policy,'' which it says is necessary to counter threats from South Korea and the United States, but officials have recently stressed the role of the party in improving the standard of living for the people, who are increasingly aware of how far they lag behind their affluent cousins south of the Demilitarized Zone and in economic giant China. In the run-up to this year's anniversary, large-scale construction and development projects have been launched and hailed with great fanfare in the state media. The projects include new hydropower plants and high-rise apartments, but it is unclear how much of North Korea's limited financial resources have been put into improving the lot of the majority of its citizens who are not fortunate enough to live in the relatively developed and affluent capital.","293":"South Korean police said Tuesday they have arrested 41 people in China for alleged telephone-based financial scams in rare cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said they arrested 39 South Koreans and two ethnic Koreans in China for allegedly opening call centers in China and making random calls to South Korean citizens, fooling them by offering to grant loans or protect their deposits.After dividing their roles into team leaders and counselors, the suspects prepared 87 different scam scenarios to adapt to each recipient's situation, police said.In most of the cases, they took money from those who had debt by offering loans at a lower interest rate than those they were currently paying, but the victims would first need to pay off the original loan. Then, the scammers would transfer the victim to another group member pretending to be the original lender and steal the money sent to pay off the original loan. Victims would sometimes borrow money from people around them to pay off the original loans.\u00a0 The scammers even disguised themselves as a wine sellers and an electronics store.Some 2.14 billion won ($1.84 million) in total from 423 victims was siphoned off by the swindlers between October 2012 and June 2015.The rare cooperation between South Korean and Chinese police came after a senior South Korean police officer visited China in May to seek a joint probe on telephone-based financial scams.South Korean and Chinese police arrested five suspects by raiding their call center in China's eastern city of Qingdao on June 19, according to the South Korean police.The arrest came about three months after obtaining details on the call center and its members from six others, who were detained for allegedly withdrawing money or providing bank accounts for the scammers.Police said they later arrested 30 other scammers when they came to South Korea.\"Local authorities' support is crucial to arrest the leaders of the phone-based scam groups as they often stay abroad,\" said a spokesman for the SMPA, adding they are expecting further collaboration. A total of 35,859 voice phishing cases occurred in 2014, compared with 22,351 recorded in 2012, according to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office. (Yonhap)","294":"The ruling Saenuri Party's special labor reform committee held its first meeting Tuesday, as part of efforts to push ahead with revamping the nation's rigid labor market.Last week, President Park Geun-hye's chief of staff, top government officials and party's senior leaders created the special committee in line with Park's drive to reform the structure of the labor sector. \"The 19th National Assembly's regular session is the last chance for reform,\" Rep. Rhee In-je, chief of the committee, said in a press briefing following the meeting. \"The committee will have a deep conversation with the opposition so that relevant laws can be passed during this year's session,\" Rhee said.\u00a0 Both Park and the ruling party have agreed that passing revisions to various labor and employment laws could help put the country's sluggish economy back on track and create more jobs eventually.Rhee further said that the committee will act as a dialogue channel between the opposition party and a tripartite committee of the government, businesses and labor organizations so that the relevant parties can better discuss conflicting issues. The key issue is introducing a wage peak system, a mechanism strongly opposed by the labor circle.The government and the ruling party assert that the mechanism creates additional job openings for young workers by lowering the wages of those nearing retirement in exchange for extending their time on the job. The dialogue between the tripartite committee has been stalled since April, when an umbrella labor union walked out of the negotiations with the government and management on labor market reforms.\"I hope that the tripartite committee of the government, businesses and labor organizations resumes early next month and comes up with a social consensus by September,\" Rhee said.Rhee also called on the tripartite committee to resume dialogue and make concessions to produce a deal meant to get a social consensus on the issue. Another issue at stake regards market duality -- the difference in pay and job security between regular and non-regular workers.Park has repeatedly called to decrease the overall number of temporary workers who tend to feel less secure about their jobs than regular employees.

The company's revenue came to 29 billion won ($24.9 million) in 2014.It will, however, continue to charge regular monthly subscription fees to shop owners, which stand at around 30,000 won to 50,000 won. Around 150,000 shops are registered on the application.The company said South Korea's food-delivery market stands at around 12 trillion won to 14 trillion won annually, adding the application takes up around 1.7 trillion won of the combined volume.First distributed in 2010, the app provides users with services similar to the likes of the U.S. counterpart GrubHub Food Delivery & Takeout.The company said it will also launch a new service, \"Baemin Fresh,\" which will deliver foods, such as fruits and cooked dishes, through refrigerated trucks between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. to customers' doors in order to add to their convenience.The company came under the spotlight when U.S. financial firm Goldman Sachs said last year it will invest 40 billion won in the firm.Goldman Sachs officials then reportedly said the food-ordering program for smartphones is a \"locally made service with innovative ideas,\" with which the investment bank \"hopes to form a partnership and support further development.\" (Yonhap)","297":"South Korea will be considered a priority candidate when the existing members of the Trans PacificPartnership talk about accepting new members of the massive free trade agreement, a former White House official said Thursday.Matthew Goodman, who served as a former White House coordinator for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation until early 2012, also said in a phone interview that TPP will provide enormous opportunities for a struggling South Korean economy.\"I think Korea should be first in line when the existing 12 TPP members are to talk to new countries interested in joining in the second round,\" said Goodman, currently senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"I don't think that's going to be soon because unfortunately there's going to be some time needed for the existing TPP agreement to be ratified by the existing members, but I think, probably by the end of 2016 or 2017, maybe the existing members will be willing to talk to new members and I think Korea should be at the front of the line,\" he said.After marathon negotiations, trade ministers of the U.S. and 11 other nations reached the landmark deal earlier this week, which would create the largest trading bloc in the world, which accounts for about 40 percent of global gross domestic product.Goodman said South Korea should have joined the negotiations from the beginning.\"Now, it's too late to join the first round and I think there will be some damage to Korea's economic interest-not very serious but a little bit of trade diversion, technical term for trade moving away from Korea. It will have some negative impact on the Korean economy but not very serious,\" he said.

Kim Moo-sung, chairman of South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party without saying what provocation it would be, according to the party's spokesman, Rep. Kim Young-woo, who was present in the meeting.Kim did not identify the U.S. intelligence official.South Korean officials have said the North could conduct a long-range rocket or missile test around the October anniversary as the regime has completed the upgrading of its west coast rocket launch site so as to make it accommodate bigger rockets.The U.S. intelligence official was also quoted as saying that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un appears to be making major policy decisions on his own, and the execution of close aides is believed to be part of a process to consolidate his grip on power.The official also said the U.S. is paying greater attention to the North's human rights abuses.Referring to the North's test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile in May, the U.S. official also told South Korean lawmakers that the U.S. is taking note of the fact that the missile was fired from under water, according to the spokesman.The U.S. official was also quoted as saying that relations between China and North Korea are not good, but Beijing is against imposing sanctions strong enough to put the North into trouble.Kim has been on a nine-day visit to the U.S. since Saturday.Also Monday, Kim delivered an address at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stressing that South Korea and the U.S. should put together an alternative convincing enough for North Korea to give up its \"byeongjin\" policy of pursuing economic and nuclear development at the same time.The U.S. should exercise creativity to come up with such an alternative so as to end the standoff over the North's nuclear program, just as it has resolved the Iranian nuclear problem and restored full diplomatic relations with Cuba, Kim said.Kim also called for support for unification of the Korean Peninsula, saying it would serve as a growth engine for Northeast Asian countries and contribute to world peace and stability.Unification could come earlier than thought, he said.He emphasized the importance of the U.S. and the South maintaining strong capabilities to deter North Korea, saying the communist regime can stage armed provocations at any time depending on its domestic situation.The Korea-U.S. alliance is developing into a \"global alliance\"that deals with not only bilateral issues, but also global matters, Kim said, adding that he is certain the alliance will become stronger in the future.Also Monday, Kim held a close-door meeting with Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee.During the meeting, Kim stressed the importance of Japan making a sincere apology for its wartime atrocities, saying Japan's perception of history has been an obstacle to security cooperation between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan, according to Rep.

(Yonhap)Audi Korea, which is presumed to have sold some 29,000 of the rigged cars as part of the Volkswagen Group, issued a similar apology.The rigged cars sold by the two companies in the country is tentatively tallied at over 120,000.\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere apology on behalf of Volkswagen Korea for breaking the trust of our Korean customers,\u201d the company CEO Thomas Kuehl said in a parliamentary audit, after he issued the first official apology in Korea via newspaper advertisements. \u201cI also want to apologize for the late response. Due to complexity of the issue and different emission standards in Korea, it took a long time to investigate how many cars were affected. Be assured we will do everything to clarity and solve this issue as soon as possible,\u201d he said.He added that Volkswagen is fully cooperating with government officials worldwide including in Seoul to determine the exact cause of this issue. He emphasized, however, that none of the cars currently being sold across the country have the device in question, and that the rigged cars do not show any safety-related defects when driven.The companies were to send separate letters of apology to each of its customers. They did not mention the details about how to compensate the customers.Kuehl told the lawmakers that details of the follow-up measures would be revealed after the government investigation is complete. Seoul\u2019s Environment Ministry last week launched an investigation into the suspected models over the emission rigging.Lawmakers also questioned him about the possibility of the product recall worsening the fuel efficiency of the cars, and if Volkswagen planned to compensate for it. Kuehl reiterated that he could not give a definitive answer yet, but vowed to address the issue after the probe is complete.Volkswagen Korea has launched a website that helps customers determine if their car has been rigged, and Audi plans to launch a website for the same purpose.The public apology was widely perceived as an attempt to address public discontent amid an ongoing investigation by the government. Some 40 Volkswagen owners entered a joint lawsuit against the company in less than a week, with hundreds more expected to follow suit.Volkswagen on Wednesday announced that it would launch a massive recall in January for vehicles affected by the emission tests scandal.

Joel Lee\/The Korea HeraldThe Korea Herald: As this year marks Singapore\u2019s 50th independence anniversary, what is the country\u2019s vision moving forward out of the Lee Kuan Yew era?Yip Wei Kiat: In a recent speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outlined concurrent national priorities for the next 10, 25 and 50 years.In the next 10 years, we want to continue to raise our GDP per capita \u2015 currently $56,000. To do so, Singapore needs to tap our society\u2019s productive forces and people\u2019s creative desires. We need higher wages, lower unemployment and better life opportunities. However, as there is no development model for us to benchmark, we must shape our own future. Our government\u2019s focus has always been growing the nation\u2019s economic pie. Since the 1970s, our government nurtured labor-intensive industries by inviting foreign manufacturing investments that provided jobs for the locals. Throughout the 1970s to early 1980s, our economic focus shifted from labor-intensive to capital-intensive sectors based on advanced technology and management. Knowing that an unregulated market can lead to economically and socially undesirable results, the Singaporean bureaucracy has intervened to push our economy to higher planes \u2015 technology-driven and knowledge-based economy. Over the next 25 years, it is vital to raise the current total fertility rate of 1.2 children per family, one of the lowest in the world. An aging and shrinking population will have severe implications on our economy and society. To combat the demographic decline, our government provides grants, tax incentives, education subsidies, housing benefits, child care services, and maternity and paternity leaves to families. We also promote a healthy work-life balance. Immigration may soften the impact, but given Singapore\u2019s small size, it is not a panacea. We want to manage the pace and composition of immigration, as well as social integration. We cannot afford to open the floodgate of immigration to a level that would alter our hard-earned identity. In keeping with this approach, Singapore\u2019s ethnic balance \u2015 Chinese majority (74 percent) and Malay (13) and Indian (9) minorities \u2015 has remained much the same since the country\u2019s founding. Forging a strong sense of national identity and belonging will be paramount over the next 50 years. Singapore started as a multiethnic, multicultural and multi-religious society since the beginning. Constructing a sense of national identity, where everyone feels part of a community, was essential. It was nationhood \u2015 a sense of belonging \u2015 rather than nationalism \u2015 an ideological vehicle for achieving objectives \u2015 that kept the country together.That is why an ethnic Chinese in Singapore would identify himself or herself as \u201cSingaporean Chinese\u201d as opposed to \u201cChinese Singaporean.\u201d This illustrates the predominance of national identity over cultural background.At the same time, Singapore is open to individuals that can fit into the core of our society. The challenge is to maintain our identity in an era of demographic sea changes, much like trying to keep the same flavor and consistency of a cup of tea with a tea bag, while continually pouring water in.Photo exhibition \u201cWe: Defining Stories\u201d at the Seoul Finance Center on Thursday. Joel Lee\/The Korea HeraldKH: What is the significance of Singapore-Korea relations in terms of diplomacy and commerce? Yip: Singapore and Korea have built strong bonds of friendship and cooperation over the last four decades, since former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former President Park Chung-hee established diplomatic ties in 1975. The goodwill between our leaders remains strong, as demonstrated by President Park Geun-hye\u2019s attendance at late Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s state funeral in March this year.On the international stage, we share similar views and positions on a wide range of issues. We strive for an open and inclusive regional architecture for peace, security and cooperation, and consult closely to strengthen multilateral frameworks, such as the ASEAN-plus processes, East Asia Summit and APEC. We also collaborate to provide safe navigation in the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea through maritime communication lanes. Trade and investment are the backbone of our cooperation. As major trading nations, Singapore and Korea signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2005 that came into effect the following year. Since then, bilateral commerce has grown steadily, with the trade volume reaching $35 billion last year \u2015 the largest among ASEAN members. We are today one of each other\u2019s top 10 trading partners. Singapore ranks in the top list of foreign investors in Korea, and there are more than 1,000 Korean businesses in Singapore in trading, shipping, logistics, construction and finance. The Singapore economy is presently undergoing a transition to raise productivity to compensate for labor shortage. Likewise, Korea is also looking for new growth engines to navigate an uncertain global economic environment. Both countries can cooperate in the innovative sectors of biomedicine, education, information communication technology and meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibition. Singapore has embarked on a \u201cSmart Nation Program\u201d to increase mobile connectivity by embedding ICT in our infrastructures, companies and homes. Korea, with its world-leading ICT expertise, can help Singapore. The two countries can cooperate more in third markets, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc with 600 million people. Korean companies do not yet have as strong a footprint there as other foreign competitors, and as a regional hub, Singapore can be a home base for Korea making inroads into the region. KH: The late LKY famously advocated that Asian societies were better governed by an authoritative leadership based on Confucian values. In a new global environment, will the Singaporean government adopt a more liberal form of governance? Yip: Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s leadership was always grounded in pragmatism (rather) than ideology. He formulated policies based on the best available information, and when things did not work, switched to alternatives. In the early days, Lee famously said, \u201cPoetry is a luxury we cannot afford.\u201d Much like Korea, he encouraged the \u201chard skills\u201d of labor, technology, commerce and education over the \u201csoft skills\u201d of literature, arts and philosophy. But our leaders know that many of the solutions we used 50 years ago do not work today. In a recent media interview, Prime Minister Lee noted that our society has become more pluralistic and younger people have different passions.Our biggest challenge is to maintain \u201cunity in diversity.\u201d Our government tries to keep a balance between the freedom of speech and the rule of law, by allowing more freedom of expression without letting things slide into chaos. In a small country where various ethnic, religious and class groups coexist, individual aspirations must be balanced with the society\u2019s interest. As we have seen in some countries, diversity without cohesion can unravel the social fabric very quickly and easily. KH: What is the secret behind the success of the Singaporean bureaucracy and Foreign Service, known to be efficient, effective and incorruptible?Yip: The Singapore Civil Service reflects what Singapore is all about in many ways. Constrained by limited resources, we have had to excel in everything to survive. As our people are our country\u2019s only resources, Singapore has developed a lean and efficient bureaucracy and Foreign Service with competent diplomats. Today we have only 49 embassies, consulates-general and consulates around the world, which constantly prioritize our objectives for optimal outcomes.I joined the Foreign Service more than 20 years ago after graduating from the university. It has been an exciting journey ever since. Working in the Foreign Service is not simply a job or career, but a lifestyle. It can be highly fulfilling in terms of professional and personal development, but at the same time, requires much personal and family sacrifice.I have had the privilege of serving all three Singaporean leaders \u2015 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and former prime ministers Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew. Singaporean officials have always been pragmatic rather than ideological, ready to change minds facing new circumstances. We have always believed \u201cwhat matters is what works.\u201d Singapore will continue to choose what brings bread to our tables regardless of ideology. As the global environment around our nation evolves, our leadership will have to adapt. But our core objectives \u2015 the wealth of Singapore and welfare of Singaporeans \u2015 will not change.

Joel Lee\/The Korea HeraldSince establishing diplomatic relations in 1962, the bilateral ties have grown steadily, reaching a strategic partnership in 2011. Colombia dispatched 5,204 soldiers to the Korean War (1950-53) as the only South American country of 16 participating nations. The war for Korea\u2019s freedom and democracy killed 245 Colombians and wounded 557. \u201cSimilar to Korea trying to achieve national unification, Colombia faces grave challenges in achieving peace with the FARC guerilla group, which has destabilized our nation for over five decades,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cAs we are fighting a subversive menace that aims to overthrow our democratic government, Korea\u2019s experience in managing peace and security on the peninsula can be a valuable guide for us.\u201d Colombian Ambassador Tito Saul Pinilla (right) speaks at\u00a0an independence reception at Grand Hyatt Seoul on Tuesday Joel Lee \/ The Korea HeraldPinilla added that Korea\u2019s ability to integrate North Korean refugees would provide guidance for Colombia, as it tries to socially include some 20,000 former guerillas and other groups that were once \u201cat the fringes of the law,\u201d through the peace deal with FARC. The peace process, in which victim compensation and conflict resolution remain to be completed, has decreased massacres, kidnappings, disappearances and displacements to historically low levels, according to The Economist. Following President Park Geun-hye\u2019s visit to Colombia in April, Korea has pledged to financially support rehabilitating Colombian soldiers and victims of armed conflicts. Colombia is a member of the Latin American trade bloc Pacific Alliance, comprised of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. As a counterpart to the Mercosur trade alliance of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, the Pacific Alliance aims to increase economic linkages with Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Australian and ASEAN markets. The ambassador stressed that there is plenty of room to expand bilateral commerce as the trade structure is highly complementary and the Colombian market is growing rapidly at over 4 percent yearly, with rising middle classes. Colombia exports agricultural produce, natural resources and primary manufactured goods to Korea, while Korea sends electronic and automotive products to Colombia. Colombian exports to Korea \u2015 mainly coal, coffee, ferronickel, metallurgy and basic chemicals \u2015 increased by 22 percent in 2014 from the previous year, reaching $520 million. Korean exports amounted to $1.5 billion, one-third of it from the automotive sector. The bilateral free trade agreement, signed in February 2013, is awaiting Colombian constitutional approval before entering into force. \u201cIn football terms, we have finished the first half of getting to know each other and becoming familiar with our business environments,\u201d Pinilla highlighted. \u201cIt is now time to materialize the opportunities we have identified at governmental and institutional levels.\u201dMore than 40 Korean companies operate in Colombia, making Korea the second-largest Asian investor in the country after Japan. Cumulative Korean investment has reached $176 million over the last 10 years. With more than 10 million cultivable hectares, Colombia has large potential for mass food production, vying to be the \u201cpantry of the world,\u201d according to the embassy. Pinilla pointed to growing educational exchanges between the two countries, as more Colombian students are choosing Korea as a university education destination. Fifty low-income students from Colombia will start studying in Korea next year, many in engineering, through scholarships provided by 10 Korean universities.

He has just finished his second internship at a big firm, with no full-time job lined up.

I regret taking those years off now because I feel I\u2019m falling behind everyone else.\u201dPark is one of some 410,000 young South Koreans in their 20s who are not in school and out of work as of June this year, according to Statistics Korea on Sunday.\u00a0 Young Koreans in Seoul protest against the government\u2019s labor policies for the nation\u2019s youth population, using a large, gold-colored spoon to criticize politicians and businessmen with prosperous backgrounds and therefore \"never experienced the difficulties faced by young job seekers today.\u201d In the Korean language, someone born into a wealthy family is said to have \u201cbeen born with a gold spoon in his or her mouth.\u201d (Yonhap)The nation\u2019s youth unemployment reached the highest this year since 2000, raising serious concerns about the government\u2019s labor policies especially for the country\u2019s younger population, as well as the limited job security among young contract workers. The number of unemployed young Koreans, which stood at 330,000 back in 2013, rose to 380,000 last year, and reached 410,000 in the first half of this year. This is the second consecutive year for the youth unemployment rate to peak since 2000 -- when the country was still reeling from the aftermaths of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The statistics show that the government\u2019s efforts to tackle youth unemployment have not been effective so far. The Ministry of Labor and Employment allocated 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) this year for projects to combat youth unemployment, with some 40 policies -- including special programs for those who wish to seek employment overseas and free mentorship service -- specifically aiming to support young job seekers. In an effort to fight the low employment among the younger people, the ministry even formed a special task force in June to help them find positions or opportunities that match their skills or draw on their formal job training or education. Kim Soo-hyun, a researcher at the Seoul Institute, said the Asian financial crisis had a long-lasting impact on Korea\u2019s job market. \u201cAs the market became unpredictable after the crisis, more companies preferred to hire contract workers with previous job experience over young, full-time workers for entry positions, who are difficult to dismiss even if the business goes down,\u201d he wrote in his study on youth unemployment published last year.Kim Gwang-seok, a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute, also said the lack of full-time positions among young workers is linked to the high youth unemployment rate. According to Statistics Korea, 34.8 percent of Koreans aged 15-29 started their career with a contractual position as of May, meaning one-third of young Koreans participate in the workforce for the first time with a limited job security. Among them, 19.6 percent said their first job\u2019s contract was less than a year.Part-time job opportunities have worked to spike the employment rate for the time being.According to the statistics, the number of Koreans in their 20s who were newly employed in fact increased by 56,000 last year from 2013.But according to lawmaker Chung Se-kyun from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the situation poses a more long-term problem on the whole, saying that the number of young Koreans aged 15-29 who are out of work would reach 1.16 million, if the statistics include those who \u201cgave up\u201d work, and those who are not actively seeking employment at all. Researcher Kim had a similar outlook. \u201cIf the number of contract positions increase while the full-time positions don\u2019t, it will eventually increase the unemployment rate later on. \u201cIt\u2019s because once the contract ends, the worker has to endure another period of unemployment until he or she finds a job,\u201d Kim said.Seoul Institute\u2019s Kim echoed the concerns. \u201cIncreasing number of contract jobs may raise the employment rate temporarily,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut in the long run, it can\u2019t really be a solution to the essence of the problem.

But of course, (Japan) will never renounce its claim to Dokdo. Thus, it will likely maintain the same expression it has used to refer to Dokdo, rather than adopting more provocative terms.\u201dAccording to the Japanese media, the focal point of this year\u2019s defense white paper will be the security challenges from China that has been increasingly aggressive in its territorial disputes involving the South China Sea.China has been turning numerous rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands into artificial islands to construct military bases equipped with naval harbors, airstrips, radar facilities and other equipment, and this is regarded by the U.S. and Japan as a move to ultimately alter the regional status quo.Kyodo News reported earlier this month that Tokyo\u2019s defense white paper would mention that China has been continuing with \u201ccoercive measures\u201d in the South China Sea. China has asserted its claim to the South China Sea with \u201cthe nine-dashed-line\u201d \u2015 a maritime demarcation line that takes in more than 80 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have engaged in intense maritime territorial squabbles with China.The Japanese media also said the 2015 white paper would touch on North Korea\u2019s push to develop a nuclear-tipped submarine-launched ballistic missile, describing it as a \u201cseriously destabilizing factor\u201d to escalate tensions on the peninsula.Observers say that the content regarding Dokdo in the white paper may not seriously damage Korea-Japan relations given that the claim is expected as it has appeared in the paper for the last decade.Japan incorporated Dokdo as part of its territory in 1905 before colonizing the entire peninsula.

But throughout the years, there has been criticism that these elite schools have transformed into cram schools preparing students for college admission.\u201cThe competition-based education paradigm has been an engine for Korea\u2019s rapid growth. But the system now is now so focused on \u2018being the best\u2019 that it is threatening the well-being of the community,\u201d Cho said at a recent press conference. Since taking the helm, his emphasis has been to restore the competence of 1,520 regular high schools that have slumped to the position of second-rate education institutions. Parents of students attending Mirim Girls\u2019 High School on Thursday hold demonstrations protesting the Seoul Metropolitan Office\u2019s decision to cancel the school\u2019s status as an autonomous private high school. (Yonhap)In Korea, there are 31 foreign language high schools and science schools, 26 science high schools, seven international schools and 49 autonomous private high schools. They are considered elite schools, as they are more proficient than regular schools in sending their graduates to top-tier universities.These schools were not originally designed to establish a hierarchy over traditional high schools. On the contrary, the government has consistently attempted to abolish the high school pecking order since 1974, when it banned each school from conducting their own admission tests and stipulated that middle school graduates should be randomly distributed to high schools in their respective regions.But releasing the junior high students from the pressures of high school admission tests had sparked criticism that the policy brought down the overall quality of the students\u2019 academic ability. In addition, there was growing disparity in academic achievements between students in the affluent southern Seoul area \u2015 the so-called Gangnam School District 8 which includes Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu \u2015 and students elsewhere, as wealthy parents in Gangnam were able spend more on private education. The tutor-ban in the 1980s did little to rein in the private education frenzy; if anything, it only fueled it further.By the 1980s, foreign language high schools began to pop up as part of the government\u2019s push to foster students excelling in foreign languages. At their inception, only students with the lowest grades applied there. In 1992, the government granted foreign language high schools and science high schools the status of \u201cspecial-purpose high schools,\u201d which gave them the right to hold admission processes of their own. This effectively allowed them to handpick students who exceled in classes. In 1996, Daewon Foreign Language High School became the first institution since the 1970s to send more than 200 of its graduates to Seoul National University, widely considered the top college in Korea.Autonomous private high schools also started in pursuit of an ideal. Former President Lee Myung-bak believed competition was critical to improving students\u2019 competence. In 2010, his administration introduced a school that granted more leeway than regular schools in creating it own curriculum.In exchange, it received less in government subsidies, and made up for the lack of funding by charging parents about three times more in tuition fees. The administration believed that by allowing autonomy, a diverse set of high school curriculums would come to exist. In reality, autonomous private high schools used their freedom to turn themselves into cram schools.Local civic group World Without Worries About Private Education recently conducted a study on 44 of the country\u2019s 49 autonomous schools. They found that 37 schools had more than half of their curriculum devoted to Korean, English and math \u2015 the key subjects in the annual college entrance exam, the Suneung.\u201cAutonomous high schools are using their freedom to increase Suneung-related subjects. This is not diversity \u2015 it only reinforces the current test-based system,\u201d said an official from the group. A 17-year-old high school dropout protests against Korea\u2018s education system and college admission process in front of Gyeongsang National University in South Gyeongsang Province on July 8. (Yonhap)Over the decades, the government has launched a myriad of efforts to get rid of the system that is primarily focused on getting students to best universities and colleges, to no avail.\u201cThey (the government) are barking up the wrong tree. They say they\u2019re looking to add variety, yet the policies have only resulted in top-down variety,\u201d said Hong Hoo-jo, a professor of education at Korea University. He pointed out that the school systems introduced by past administrations have only resulted in establishing a new pecking order among high schools: special-purpose schools, autonomous private high schools form the elite group, while the regular high schools are at the bottom of the barrel.Such classes do not officially exist. In reality, these de facto elite schools have a chance to recruit students with higher grades as their admission process starts earlier than those of regular schools.Schools for students specializing in arts, sports and other specialized schools also hold their admission processes early, but these elite schools recruit students from the same pool as the regular high schools.This allows the special-purpose schools to swoop in to collect all the top-ranking middle school students, and the leeway of curriculum allows them to further pursue education based on preparing for the Suneung. As a result, the students from these schools dominate college admissions. According to the website Higher Education in Korea, 26.6 percent of SNU\u2019s freshman students last year were graduates from special-purpose high schools. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology picked 76.3 percent of their incoming class from these schools. Parents of students attending autonomus private high schools block one of the school principals from attending the hearing held at Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education on July 7. (Yonhap)Autonomous schools account for less than 3 percent of all schools, yet they account for 10.9 percent of freshmen in universities and colleges based in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, which is generally harder to enter than schools in other regions.The grades are not the only barrier separating the \u201celites\u201d from regular students. The financial burden of attending autonomous schools prevents students from poorer families from attending them. For some schools like Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, the combination of tuition fees, dormitory fees and other academic-related costs amount to over 20 million won ($17,400) a year, which is nearly double the yearly tuition fee for an average university here. The tuition fees alone are more than eight times higher than that of regular schools, which is about 1.8 million won.While universities claim they try to conduct an admission process as fairly as possible, they cannot ignore the profound difference among schools. For example, a student at the top of the class of a regular high school is not recognized on the same level as one who aced the class in a special-purpose school.\u201cIt is much easier to pick students based on their Suneung scores like before. The Education Ministry is leaving it up to us to evaluate competence of each school, which makes it harder for us,\u201d said an official at the admissions department of a Seoul-based university. \u201cI\u2019d rather that they had few special-purpose schools for students who are really special. But it is nearly impossible to get rid of them once you\u2019ve made them.\u201dThis was well demonstrated last year, when the SMOE attempted to strip eight elite schools of their special status. After a period of controversy, the ministry revised the law so that local education offices could not revoke autonomous schools of their status without its consent.Hong of Korea University said the inevitable trend of high schools turning into cram institutions hinders all attempts to diversify the education that the students deserve.\u201cThe university admissions process is too simple. High school education is only an advanced course of what students learned in middle school, which saps the overall quality of Korean education,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are various jobs, different fields of expertise in society. We should allow high school students to study subjects closely related to what they want to pursue in college and later on in their careers. That\u2019s the only way we can achieve real diversity.\u201dBy Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","326":"The leader of the ruling Saenuri Party vowed Monday to press ahead with efforts to reform the country's rigid labor market.\u00a0\u00a0\"The party will make all-out efforts in pushing ahead with reforming the labor market in the second half of this year for the sake of our country's future,\" Kim Moo-sung said in a meeting with senior party members. \u00a0\u00a0The remarks came as President Park Geun-hye has been struggling to overhaul labor issues regarding market duality -- the difference in pay and job security between regular and non-regular workers.\u00a0\u00a0Companies have become increasingly reluctant to recruit regular workers and instead only rely on non-regular workers that they can fire more easily as the economy remains sluggish, a development that has pushed up the jobless rate for young people.\u00a0\u00a0\"The most serious problem the South Korean society is facing is the polarization of the labor market,\" Kim said, adding that such polarization leads to a widening income gap.\u00a0\u00a0Kim noted that the party will make the issue a top priority as solving the problem could help put the country's sluggish economy back on track.\u00a0\u00a0The leader also asked the main opposition party for its cooperation.

The day calls on individuals around the world to spend 67 minutes in the service of others \u2015 providing food, education, shelter and volunteer work \u2015 symbolizing the 67 years Mandela devoted to humanity. \u201cBecoming part of the international Mandela Day movement requires an action that helps improve the lives of people in need,\u201d South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam told The Korea Herald. \u201cTo ensure that the service has lasting benefits, participants should strive for physical changes in communities, as well as instill hope in people to take charge of their destinies and circumstances.\u201dShe added that the cumulative actions of people, step by step, could become a transformative movement.The Korea Herald spoke to the new ambassador to Korea about Mandela\u2019s role in transforming South Africa from a country ruled by apartheid to a democratic global player; lessons Korea can take from his life to promote peace and harmony; and impending bilateral issues.\u00a0 South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam. Joel Lee\/The Korea HeraldThe Korea Herald: Describe, from your perspective and experience as a diplomat, Mandela\u2019s achievements for South Africa and the world. Nozuko Gloria Bam: Twenty-one years ago, on 27 April 1994, South Africans of all races and creeds took to the polls to cast aside centuries of discrimination and oppression and build a new society based on freedom and democracy. This historic election was an epochal moment marking the end of apartheid rule, and paved the way for a united and nondiscriminatory society. It ushered in a new era of peace and progress which had an impact across South Africa and into the continent\u2019s hinterlands.In his inaugural address in Pretoria on May 9, 1994, Mandela declared, \u201cNever, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will experience the oppression of one by another.\u201d He added, \u201cWe enter into a covenant that we shall build a society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without and fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity \u2015 a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world.\u201d Mandela transformed South Africa by forsaking bloodshed and violence, forged democracy through institutions and empowerment of blacks, and bolstered our international engagement.His sacrifice, activism and leadership earned him the reputation of a benevolent negotiator and quintessential peacemaker around the world. To some, Mandela was a powerful negotiator, having an indubitable moral authority and a firm sense of fairness. In 1993, he won the Nobel Peace Prize, which he shared with former South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk.Mandela united the country\u2019s different races and fragmented government, which had preferentially served the interests of the white population. He also established the new democratic constitution that became the envy of the world.Mandela stood tall and proud in defense of Africa. He was unrestrained in embracing the African National Congress\u2019s former allies, including the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and late Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, despite American criticisms. He promoted peace and forgiveness through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission established in 1995, and endorsed reconciliation through racially unsegregated sporting events.He also supported charity extensively through the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the Nelson Mandela Children\u2019s Fund and the HIV-AIDS initiative \u201c46664,\u201d named after his prison number.After stepping down from the presidency in 1999, Mandela acted as a middleman in crisis-hit areas, such as Burundi and Congo. In 2007, Mandela, his wife Graca Machel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu convened meetings of world leaders to solve global problems and ease human suffering.Thanks to Mandela\u2019s lifelong contributions, South Africa is now firmly integrated into the global community as a responsible stakeholder. Domestically, our country has steadily moved toward a humane society that is free, united in diversity and bountiful in opportunities for everyone. Our government has provided basic services, education and housing to many of our citizens. KH: What problems does South Africa face, and what is the government doing to solve them?Bam: While South Africa has made remarkable advances, the problems of poverty, inequality and unemployment have been exacerbated by the global economic slump. Our country still experiences socioeconomic disparities, which are serious by international standards. Solving these challenges has become the main focus of our government. By working together with business, labor and society, we are determined to improve our economy and democracy. Our government has prioritized nine areas for economic growth and job creation: energy, agriculture, mineral extraction, industrial development, private investment, mitigation of workplace conflicts, promotion of small enterprises and rural cooperatives, infrastructure investment and implementation of the National Development Plan. The NDP aims to promote Operation Phakisa, which targets maritime shipping, fisheries, aquaculture, mining, oil and gas, biotechnology and tourism.KH: Mandela served 27 years in prison, but he advocated forgiveness. What was his vision of \u201cjustice?\u201d Did his vision encompass retributive justice or wholehearted reconciliation? Bam: Mandela\u2019s admirable accomplishment is his personal triumph over vengeful will as well as public leadership in reconciling a bitterly divided society.He was determined to not let the past anguish determine the future actions and laws. He came out of the Robben Island prison in 1990 after a 27-year imprisonment as a gentle soul, and graciously embraced his former enemies. He went through a complete identity transformation through his ordeals. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission he established investigated historic human rights violations and gave a vent to grievances. He granted amnesty to those who testified. He championed reconciliation among races, and espoused the principles of nation-building and cooperative governance. KH: What lessons can Korea learn from Mandela\u2019s achievements to bridge social, cultural and ideological divides as part of its multicultural transition? Bam: South Africa had a long history of white colonialism and repression, which generated hatred and conflict among ethnic groups. Apartheid had hampered any sense of a shared national identity among the different groups, as they all had such differing experiences and perceptions of that part of history. Therefore, creating a new democratic identity was central to Mandela\u2019s new government. The constitution, reconciliatory politics and grassroots activism consciously promoted a new national identity. Firstly, our government introduced a new constitution in 1999 to heal past wounds and establish social justice, human rights and the rule of law. The document allowed the freedom of association, language and religion, and included a bill of rights for allaying ethnic tensions. Secondly, the government created affirmative action packages designed to support disadvantaged groups and eradicate structural discrimination installed by the apartheid government.Thirdly, the government was reformed for national unity by constitutionally incorporating power-sharing mechanisms. This has prevented particular ethnic groups from dominating politics and society, and was supported across social strata. Fourthly, the constitution reorganized administrative jurisdictions to equally distribute power and deescalate conflict. Nine provinces replaced the four provinces from the apartheid era. Fifthly, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu helped heal the wounds and inculcated accountability and transparency in public life.Sixthly, the government introduced the Reconstruction and Development Program to tackle economic inequalities, allowing equal business access for disadvantaged groups and blacks.KH: What can East Asia take from Mandela\u2019s legacy to achieve regional cooperation and historic reconciliation?Bam: Mandela said, \u201cReconciliation and nation-building would remain pious words if they were not premised on a concerted effort to remove the real roots of past conflict and injustice.\u201d His principles of perseverance, humanity and forgiveness did not just inspire South Africa, but countries far and wide. Dialogue and cooperation were fundamental values Mandela used to steer the country through crises. Cooperation between countries and communities is commensurate with the level of trust. Trust is critical for lasting peace. The Korean government\u2019s Trust-building Process and the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative are good examples, as they aim for regional cooperation in and around the Korean Peninsula. On the Korea-Japan issue, the two countries can breach their differences through frank dialogue, as it had enabled South Africans to overcome their painful past of discrimination and brutality. On the inter-Korean front, the South Korean government can reach out to North Korea and encourage dialogue, as late President Kim Dae-jung took extra steps to normalize the relations. KH: What are the impending issues in the South Africa-Korea relations in terms of diplomacy and economy? What progress has been made and what opportunities remain? Bam: Dec. 1 of this year marks the 23rd anniversary of the establishment of official ties between South Africa and Korea. Over the past two decades, our two countries have enjoyed excellent political and economic relations, which can be further strengthened.Indicative of our deepening ties, the Policy Consultative Forum was elevated to a Joint Cooperation Council, co-chaired by the two Foreign Ministers. On Oct. 17 last year, the eighth Policy Consultative Forum was held in Seoul, serving as a platform for enhanced cooperation in energy, science and technology, trade and investment as well as regional issues. Trade and investment are the backbone of our relations, with considerable room for expanding and diversifying. South Africa is well-positioned to export products in mining, automotive, agro-processing, textile, jewelry, chemical, cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors. Korean investment would create employment for South Africans. Our country is learning from Korea\u2019s development experience, particularly the Saemaul Undong rural development movement. We want to apply the principles to our country by incorporating them into our \u201cUbuntu\u201d philosophy that valorizes humanity and compassion.Our embassy also strives to boost cultural, educational and tourism exchanges. South Africa Women\u2019s Day will be held on Aug. 9 to pay homage to our women who fought tirelessly against apartheid. A film festival will be held in October to promote South African art and culture.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","328":"U.S. second lady Jill Biden said Saturday that South Korean women have made tremendous strides at the workplace, but they still face challenges in the male-dominated Asian country.\u00a0\u00a0Biden said that both the United States and South Korea face challenges, as young girls must be able to reach their full potential.\u00a0\u00a0\"Young girls and women in South Korea excel in terms of educational achievement but continue to face challenges in their workplace,\" Biden said in a reception hosted by Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung in Seoul.\u00a0\u00a0The reception came hours after the wife of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Seoul in her first trip meant to promote women's education and economic empowerment issues in South Korea.\u00a0\u00a0\"In the U.S. we have worked to empower women in the workplace so that their voices are heard throughout the society and to see those same efforts made in Korea shows how far we have come as a global community,\" Biden said.\u00a0\u00a0\"We are more successful when women have seats at the table,\" Biden said as she was looking at American and South Korean working women at an exhibition hall.\u00a0\u00a0South Korean women saw their influence dramatically grow over the past decades as more women received college education and worked their way up the corporate ladder.\u00a0\u00a0Still, women in general find it difficult to continue their careers after marriage and childbirth.\u00a0\u00a0South Korea has taken a series of measures to bring stay-at-home moms back to work in recent years to boost female labor participation, which is one of the lowest among advanced countries.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier, Biden met with female monks at a Buddhist temple in Seoul along with U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, Ambassador-at-large for Global Women's Issues Catherine Russell and Biden's sister-in-law Valerie Biden.\u00a0\u00a0\"The sisters are educating, empowering women; we talked about that, which is the purpose of our trip here,\" Biden said after meeting with the monks.\u00a0\u00a0On Saturday, Biden is set to leave for Vietnam, the second stop on her four-nation Asian swing that will also take her to Laos and Japan.

(Yonhap)","330":"South Korea's top spy agency said Friday that it will show the usage records of controversial hacking programs to lawmakers in coming days, a rare move to back up its claims that it has never used the programs to monitor civilians.The National Intelligence Service said the usage records of the hacking software are classified, but it will allow lawmakers to see them as \"an emergency measure.\"\"It will become clear that the NIS did not carry out surveillance of civilians once\" the lawmakers see the records, the spy agency said in a statement. \"There is no reason to lie.\"The statement came amid lingering controversy over the hacking software programs the spy agency purchased from an Italian hacking firm in 2012.The software program uses Remote Control System technology, which could allow hackers to manipulate and track smartphones and computers by installing spyware.The NIS said it bought the programs that can be used to hack into up to 20 mobile phones simultaneously and said the programs are designed to work through the Italian company.The spy agency said 97 agencies from 35 different countries have bought the hacking software programs from the Italian company, though no country is as mired in controversy as South Korea. It did not name the other 95 agencies.\"Why would the NIS carry out surveillance on our own people?\" the statement asked.Some South Koreans have lingering doubts about the spy agency as it had previously been accused of various illegal acts such as the wiretapping of politicians, journalists and others in the past.The NIS has said that it used most of the programs for the purpose of strengthening cyber warfare capabilities against Pyongyang.A ruling Saenuri Party official said 18 out of 20 hacking programs were used to try to glean intelligence on North Korea while the two others for research purposes. The official asked not to be identified, citing the issue's sensitivity.\u00a0The spy agency said it is \"the first line of defense\" against a grim security situation, in an apparent reference to threats posed by North Korea's cyber attacks as well as its missile and nuclear programs.South Korea was hit by a series of cyber attacks in recent years that were blamed on North Korea, though the North has denied any involvement.\u00a0In April, South Korea said that North Korea is believed to be linked to a series of leaked data on South Korea's nuclear power plants in December.

The two cultural artifacts were passed through Korean customs as they were mistakenly appraised as copied antiques.As South Korean cultural artifacts were looted by Japan during its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, Seoul has been making efforts to reclaim them.But South Korea's decision to return one of the statues to Japan came as Seoul's prosecutors concluded that there is no proof that the statue was illegally moved to the neighboring country and no one in South Korea has claimed ownership of it.A diplomatic source said that the South Korean government delivered the statue to Japanese officials earlier in the day. It will be transported via airplane later Friday, according to the source.Experts said the statue, which was crafted in the 8th century during the Unified Silla period, was presumed to have been moved to Japan through either cultural exchanges or looting during the Japanese invasion of Korea, known as the Imjin War (1592-1598).Japan is also demanding Seoul return the other Buddhist statue, which was presumed to have been made in the 14th century during the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392) and was designated by Japan as an intangible cultural asset.The decision to return it has been delayed due to the need for further investigation. The South Korean Buddhists' society has been seeking to reclaim the artifact, saying that it might have been stolen from a temple located in Seosan, some 151 kilometers south of Seoul.

Participants at the event included Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and chiefs of both the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Chung's remarks come amid a halt in government-level dialogue between the rival Koreas, which remain technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Seoul recently said it is willing to have talks with Pyongyang as it does not see North Korea's denuclearization as a precondition for better inter-Korean ties.North Korea's persistent pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles is posing a threat to the divided peninsula. Despite lingering tension, Seoul earlier said that it plans to encourage civilian groups to increase humanitarian support to the North this year to promote national unity.

Is grading one\u2019s character in the admissions process even feasible?Private education institutions, meanwhile, did not shy away from an opportunity to cash in on the plan. On the coattails of the announcement, local institutes started offering classes on how to prepare for character examinations.With the plan seeming to have more negative effects than positive ones, the ministry said in Tuesday\u2019s media briefing that applying the character evaluations in college admissions had officially been shelved.\u201cThe character evaluation should not be calibrated for evaluation in college admissions. Although we maintain that character assessment should be an important factor in the admissions process, we are leaving it to the discretion of respective colleges and universities,\u201d said a ministry official.While the ministry continues to stress the importance of character building, it \u201cmight as well give up\u201d on including it in the college admissions to avoid problems, he said.The decision sparked criticism toward the ministry\u2019s half-baked plan, and the fallacy of attempting to universally apply such abstract and individual virtues into mass education. The education circle pointed to the lack, or impossibility, of indexing \u201ccharacters\u201d into education to be applied at all schools, and that stipulating it in the law would only prompt cookie-cutter education.Plans like fostering character-building experts raised questions as well, as it lacked clear criteria. A ministry official explained that virtually anyone could apply to become one, save convicted felons, a standard that hardly appeared sufficient.\u201cHaving a law on (character building) makes it easier to enforce it on all schools. But there is also a risk of all schools just copying a system that seems to work,\u201d Yang Jung-ho, a professor of education at Sungkyunkwan University.

The Seoul Central District Court ruled that a woman, whose information was withheld, should pay 5 million won ($4,400) to her former junior female staffer as she breached the human dignity of the victim by making sexual jokes. The defendant was accused of sexually harassing the employee by asking \u201cWhat did you do last night with a guy?\u201d after seeing an atrophic scar on the victim\u2019s neck on her second day of work.\u00a0 The harasser also asked her victim whether she had ever delivered a baby before, saying, \u201cYour hair looks just like that of a mother who gave birth to a child.\u201dThe victim reported the harassment to the company, but no measures were taken. She then quit the job.Four months later, the company punished the superior with a \u201creprimand\u201d after the victim reported the case again to the company. While the defendant apologized to the junior worker later and the company offered to pay the victim a salary of five months, the victim took legal action against both her former superior and the company last year and sought 30 million won in compensation. The company had claimed that it was not accountable for the case, as it has periodically conducted anti-sexual harassment campaigns for employees. The court, however, held that the company did bear some responsibility, as the case involved a worker who was in charge of supervising other workers.

Park's case was recognized as an industrial accident earlier this month by the Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service.Meanwhile, the Seoul High Court last month sentenced Cho to 10 months in prison but suspended the term for two years for changing an aircraft's flight route.Prosecutors said they have submitted an appeal to reverse the court decision.

The two countries have not held a formal bilateral summit since 2012 as Tokyo has refused to accept Seoul's demand that it formally apologize to and compensate sexual slavery victims, known as \"comfort women.\"Strained relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's \"pivot to Asia,\" aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.Meanwhile, the CRS report said that Korea-U.S. relations have been at their most robust point since the formation of the alliance in 1953, but their ties could be tested in coming months over how to handle Seoul-Tokyo relations and how to respond to Japan's efforts to expand its military role. Seoul and Washington could also disagree over how to deal with North Korea, it said.\"The Obama administration publicly has backed Park's trustpolitik strategy and appears comfortable letting Seoul take the lead in trying to encourage more cooperative behavior from Pyongyang,\" the report said.\"However, in the future, some of the cooperative elements of Park's approach toward North Korea could conflict with U.S. policy due to an inherent tension that exists in the two countries' views of Pyongyang,\" it said.Washington's predominant concern is the North's weapons of mass destruction programs while Seoul's top priorities are WMD issues and promoting unification, the report said.The North Korean Sanctions Enforcement Act, which was introduced in the House of Representatives earlier this year, could \"conflict Park's initiatives, such as her stated desire to internationalize\" the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the report said.On the controversy over the U.S. desire to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense battery to South Korea, the report said the issue \"has become a litmus test for Seoul's straddling the gap between Beijing and Washington.\"Seoul has other concerns surrounding the issue, such as the affordability of buying its own THAAD system, the effectiveness of THAAD against North Korean missiles and the time frame when a THAAD system could become available for South Korea, the report said.

International credit rating service Moody\u2019s raised its outlook for Pakistan from negative to stable to positive between 2012 and 2015.The government has also reduced deficits, divested shares of state-owned enterprises and successfully adapted to the international bond market, Khan said. \u201cWe are partners in growth,\u201d the minister stressed. \u201cKorean businesses can be part of Pakistan\u2019s expanding economy, estimated to have a GDP of $270 billion with 4.2 percent growth last year.\u201dPakistan aims to develop its transport infrastructure, energy infrastructure, logistics and mining. Agriculture and food processing, particularly meat and poultry, are also ripe for investment, he added. To fill energy shortages by 2017, Pakistan aims to import electricity from China and Tajikistan, and gas from Turkmenistan.\u201cPakistan\u2019s geostrategic location acts as a \u2018fulcrum\u2019 between Central and South Asia,\u201d Khan claimed. \u201cWith our Asian partners, we want to transform our diplomatic friendships into economic partnerships.\u201dHe added, \u201cPakistani companies that have long looked to the West for trade and investment are increasingly looking east.\u201dAs China\u2019s east end is Korea and west end is Pakistan, and China has free trade agreements with both countries, the minister said, Islamabad and Seoul should sign an FTA to complete the triad. Pakistan has exported textile, yarn and metal to Korea for decades, and aims to expand the export\u2019s scope and range. Bilateral trade amounted to $1.2 billion last year, with the trade balance in favor of Korea: Pakistan imported $700 million from Korea and Korea imported $500 million from Pakistan. Cumulative Korean investment is $140 million. POSCO, Hyundai, Samsung, LG, Lotte and Sambu-Daewoo have set up businesses and factories in Pakistan in the construction, electronics, energy and food sectors.

Pakistan\u2019s first motorway, which runs 367 kilometers between Lahore and Islamabad, was built by a Daewoo construction company in the early 1990s.

Korean companies can participate in joint projects in Afghanistan, and build the \u201cCentral Asian connection\u201d through Gwadar, the minister noted. \u201cSo many of our sectors are underdeveloped that if you are willing to bring in new management and technology into any part of the economy, you will be met with opportunities,\u201d he claimed, adding that workers could work for many multinational firms in Pakistan.Unfortunately, the relations between Pakistan and India have not improved under the governments of prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, Khan added. \u201cThe current situation is not conducive to taking our relationship forward. (But) despite the diplomatic tension, bilateral trade has continued, ranging between $2.5 (billion) and $3 billion a year.\u201dKhan argued that the young professionals visiting Pakistan will get an \u201cexotic feel\u201d of a country on the cusp of development. \u201cLiving in Pakistan may be comparable to Korea 30 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very colorful culture, with different styles of cultural expression in music, art, theater, clothes and food.\u201dPakistan also has a diverse terrain and climate, from the high mountains in the north to the southern seas and everything in between.

The ministry has mulled whether or not to bestow itself with exclusive rights to publish history textbooks, which has caused rifts in the National Assembly and in education circles. Korea currently allows local publishers to author the textbooks for secondary education, which are certified by the government for public use.A ministry official said the announcement will be made after the parliamentary audit on government organizations wraps up this week, but claimed the ministry is still undecided on the matter.But sources say the government and ruling Saenuri Party are set on bringing back state textbooks \u2015 first implemented in 1974 and then revoked in 2002.Cheong Wa Dae supported such speculation by saying earlier Wednesday: \u201cThere is no change in position that the history textbook with a balanced view should be developed,\u201d reminding the press of President Park Geun-hye\u2019s past comments. Park said last year that textbooks in use contained factual errors and ideological bias, and that they should be fixed.The opposition claims that reinstating the system will result in the textbooks being influenced by whoever is in power. Professors from universities across the country \u2015 most recently Hanyang University and Kyung Hee University \u2015 have released statements opposing the state history textbooks.Those who oppose the state textbooks raise concerns that the government may whitewash flaws of controversial figures including Park\u2019s father, former President Park Chung-hee, who is criticized for his dictatorial rule that spanned over two decades.But the proponents of the state history textbooks claim that many of the authors for privately published textbooks are biased in favor of the leftists. Although the ministry has not commented while rival parties exchanged blows, it said in a briefing last week that the textbooks should not be used to express one\u2019s ideological views.\u201cMany citizens are expressing concerns that textbooks, which should unify the people and foster a balanced view of history, are being used as tools for ideological disputes,\u201d a ministry official said, adding that the appeal was \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d The message came as the ministry criticized the authors of high school textbooks for appealing a court order to revise sections of books that were deemed biased and incorrect. The ministry even said that some parts looked like a \u201cNorth Korean textbook\u201d \u2015 attacking the rival party \u2015 reiterating its claims that the current textbooks are filled with lopsided views and errors. The unusually strong words were widely perceived as a signal of the government\u2019s determination to change the publication system.The ministry\u2019s fierce criticism of the privately published history textbooks was echoed by the Saenuri Party in the National Assembly on Thursday, which labeled them as \u201cantistate\u201d and \u201cleftist.\u201d\u201cIt appears that (the textbooks) are biased with leftist viewpoints. ...

The NPAD pointed out the 1.2 trillion won planned for funding 18 roads and 15 railroad construction projects.The main opposition party charged that 5.6 trillion won, nearly half of the supplementary budget bill, was inserted by Park officials anxious to plug tax revenue shortfalls.NPAD Rep.

The reduction of 40,000 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018, it said.The troop reduction is driven by automatic spending cuts requirements known as \u201csequestration.\u201dThe Army further warned that unless the budget constraints are addressed, the next round of troop cuts will leave the Army with only 420,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2019.\u201cTroop levels in Korea remain the same for now.

A total of 124 South Korean small- and medium-sized enterprises are operating factories there.The South has rejected the communist neighbor's move, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.In August 2013, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park following the North's unilateral move in April of that year that shut down the park for about four months.The committee is an integral part of a deal that called for reopening the complex and adopting safeguards to prevent any work stoppages in the future. The committee has not met since June last year due to the North's refusal.The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.

The basis for this progress was the Framework Act on Women\u2019s Development, first enacted in 1995. The complete revision of the act passed the National Assembly on May 2, 2014, with the name changed to the Framework Act on Gender Equality. The revised act took effect on July 1 this year. For the past 20 years, the women\u2019s development law contributed to many areas related to female participation and gender equality. However, there were concerns that the act had its limitations as a basic law encompassing all individual laws and policies that have advanced to apply gender equality. Therefore, this change ushers in a new paradigm shift, from emphasizing women\u2019s development to the practical realization of gender equality. Moreover, this shift not only clearly ensures the philosophy of gender equality outlined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, but also guarantees gender equality rights and reaffirms the government\u2019s responsibility on the matter. The Framework Act on Gender Equality has a great significance in bringing gender equality through instituting a system of consideration of policy impacts on women, female-friendly cities, and a family policy strategy in preparation for the reunified Korea in which both men and men could equally participate, and much more.Starting this year, Women\u2019s Week has become Gender Equality Week, where gender equality policies can be advanced and the culture of gender equality can be spread throughout Korean society. Furthermore, creating measures to prevent gender discrimination in national and local governments, guaranteeing equal access to health care, setting up legal basis for the provision of women-friendly cities and reflecting gender equal perspectives in international cooperation have helped the paradigm of women\u2019s development to evolve into the practical realization of gender equality. Since the mid-1980s in Korea, many areas of society, including politics, economics, family, various institutions, laws and policies have set up the basis to eliminate discrimination against women and achieve gender equality.Moreover, the Act on Equal Employment for Both Sexes was enacted in 1987 to achieve gender equality in employment; the Infant Care Act (1991) was enacted to support child rearing; the Revision on the Three Laws on Maternity Protection (2001) was carried out to distribute the cost burden of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting; the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes (1994) and the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Crimes of Domestic Violence (1997), and the Act on the Prevention of Sexual Traffic and Protection, etc. of Victims (2004) were enacted to improve women\u2019s social status. Also, in the mid-2000s, efforts to create an environment where both men and women can enjoy a work-life balance have flourished thanks to the enactment of the Equal Employment Opportunity and Work-Family Balance Assistance Act (2007), the Act on the Promotion of the Creation of a Family-Friendly Social Environment (2007), and the Act on the Promotion of Economic Activities of Career-Interrupted Women. Furthermore, there have been continuous efforts to reflect gender perspectives in general policymaking by the Ministry of Gender Equality and many other central government ministries, such as by introducing the Gender Impact Assessment Act (2004), Gender Budget Statements and Gender Budget Balance Sheets (2009), which shine a light on international society as an exemplary case. However, since the Korean society has put so much effort and emphasis on preparing laws and systems to protect and support women, there has been a backlash, with critics calling those efforts reverse discrimination against men.And as there is an increase in the number of women excelling in legal and administrative institutions, corporations and media, there is also a social atmosphere in which many say, \u201cNow women are placed above men.\u201d Women\u2019s status in society has definitely improved, but only a few occupy influential positions in society, and many women still struggle with discrimination, suffer from nonregular employment and poverty, and are victims of domestic violence. Moreover, South Korea\u2019s female labor market participation is still characterized by the \u201cM curve.\u201d According to the 2014 Economically Active Population Survey, women\u2019s labor market participation is not much different than that of men\u2019s in their 20s, but in their 30s, it decreases due to marriage, childbirth and child care, to fall 30 percent lower than that of men\u2019s. By their late 30s, this disparity reaches about 40 percent. Among the OECD countries, only South Korea and Japan show this kind of female employment structure. In addition, women who have experienced a career break due to pregnancy, childbirth and child care earn 21.9 percent less when they are reemployed. That is the reason Korea\u2019s gender wage gap is so high compared to the rest of the OECD. Korea\u2019s achievements in gender equality would give equal benefits to men and women because traditional duties will now be understood and shared by both genders. Women are wives, girlfriends, sisters and colleagues where they live together among men in a variety of ways. Looking at it plainly, for example, when a woman is still in the workforce contributing to the household economy, the husband\u2019s burden on providing for the family will lessen greatly. Since we have advanced beyond women\u2019s development to the realization of a gender-equal society, women\u2019s policy is now facing a new threshold for change. At this stage, forming a social agreement on women\u2019s policy is very significant, and implementation of the Framework Act on Gender Equality will work as a starting point. There is a need for a social consensus on how women\u2019s policy is not just for women, but is crucial for creating a society where both men and women can enjoy happiness together.\u00a0By Lee Myung-sunLee Myung-sun is the current president of the Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute.

As the latest South Sudanese Civil War broke out in December 2013, \"the Hanbit unit perfectly carried out its top priority UN mission of protecting civilians,\" Major General Oh Jeong-il said in an interview with a pool reporter, later released by the Defense Ministry.\u00a0It was very effective in forming the crucial bond between the unit and the local people for Hanbit to have continued its humanitarian assistance operations for about 17,000 Bor war refugees even at the height of the civil war, Oh noted.The South Korean unit is now at a critical crossroads in re-defining its role in the U.N. efforts to help South Sudan stand on its own feet, the major general stressed, adding that transferring South Korea's experience of speedy economic development would be the main focus of future operations.\"As our country owns the asset of being an economic success model, the role Hanbit could play in contributing to the development of South Sudan would be the transfer of development experiences,\" Oh noted.As part of those efforts, the military will seek tighter collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency, the official development assistance body, to better provide the services, he said.As South Korea's other foreign-dispatched units, \"Ahk\" in the UAE and \"Dongmyeong\" in Lebanon, mark four and eight years of dispatch respectively, the country plans to reset strategies on its overseas troops deployment in a way it could maximize effectiveness, he said.Through the peace-keeping and rebuilding operations abroad, the South Korean military is amassing capacities and experiences to deal with any crisis situation in the Korean Peninsula, the general said. \"With combat-readiness position firmly maintained against North Korea, the military will proactively take part in the overseas troops dispatch to contribute to the international society.\" (Yonhap)","362":"The inaugural gathering of parliamentary leaders from the member countries of MIKTA concluded on Friday, with representatives of South Korea and Mexico meeting on the sidelines of the talks.The meeting between Seoul\u2019s National Assembly Speaker Rep.

But the ratio of illegal immigrants out of the total foreign nationals residing in the country dropped significantly from 24.2 percent to 11.6 percent.Meanwhile, over 60 million people came in and out of the country last year, the statistics said.Source: Justice Ministry","365":"Working mothers in South Korea spend several more hours on the weekends dealing with domestic tasks than stay-at-home mothers, while also taking a larger portion of housework than their spouses, a study showed Thursday, revealing the dark side of women with careers struggling to balance work and family. According to a study jointly conducted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family along with Statistics Korea, employed moms, on average, worked two hours longer in terms of the length of labor both at work and home, and also had about an hour and 50 minutes less leisure time than stay-at-home mothers. Though working moms spent three hours less than full-time mothers on weekdays for housework, including child care, the former worked two hours and 27 minutes more in total when adding in labor hours for their paid jobs.On Saturdays and Sundays, women from double-income households spent two extra hours catching up on the housework that piled up over the week, the study found.By age, women in their 30s spent the longest at nine hours and 13 minutes a day, an hour more than the average of other age groups, on \u201cobligatory maintenance activities\u201d such as work, household chores, study and travel time.The average hours spent only on housework by women in their 30s was also longer than other age groups with four hours and 55 minutes. The study also showed that the burden of household responsibilities in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy is still largely shouldered by mothers. Women spent nearly two hours more on housework and child care than their spouses, the study showed. Moms, regardless of their employment status, spent two hours and 27 minutes on housework while men were engaged in household chores only 31 minutes a day.In contrast, women in Australia, Canada and New Zealand did more than three hours of housework, but they were supported by their spouses who took care of the home for one hour and 50 minutes, nearly four times more than South Korean men.The clear gender imbalance on housework in South Korea may derive from the traditional gender roles of men being breadwinners and women taking charge of housework, as well as the lower rate of economically active women in the job market, the ministry said in its report.The statistics also showed that the female population surpassed the male population this year, with women aged 60 and over taking up 20.8 percent of the entire population.The employment rate of women came in at 49.5 percent, 21.9 percentage points lower than men but an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the year before.Those between 25 and 29 years of age showed the highest employment rate with 68.8 percent, but the ratio reduced to around 50 percent in the 30s when many women tend to get married and have children. The ratio rebounded to over 60 percent in the 40s.The rate of women going on to college reached 74.6 percent, surpassing men\u2019s 67.6 percent.More women took up specialized professions, with 24.4 percent of medical doctors being women, showing a consistent increase from 13.6 percent in the 1980s. Some 26.4 percent and 64.3 percent of dentists and pharmacists were women, respectively.Political advancement by women, however, still remain low, with 22.9 percent of women winning in regional assembly elections last year and 15.7 percent in general elections in 2012, the statistics said.

According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the 43-year-old Chinese diver fainted when a sudden blast took place in the nose of the 6,825-ton ship on Monday evening while he was participating in a propeller-cutting operation. The diver was immediately pulled to the surface by a colleague and moved to the hospital. He is in stable condition, but reportedly suffering from peritonitis and body muscle pain resulting from decompression. The blast is suspected to have occurred due to the combination of sparks and air that was being used for the propeller-cutting job. A consortium led by Chinese state-run company Shanghai Salvage has been leading the ship recovery work since August. Over 100 Chinese divers and workers are currently carrying out preparations for the actual recovery of the ship, with an aim to pull the ferry out of the water no later than June next year. A total of 304 passengers died in the Sewol tragedy in April last year, with nine still missing. The ministry said the diver could choose to return to work or go back to China upon treatment.

Boeing\u2019s KC-46 and Israel Aerospace Industries\u2019 B767 MMTT were in the competition.The decision defied the prevailing speculation that in its military procurement decision, Seoul would focus on variables associated with its alliance with the only security ally, the U.S., and interoperability with American forces. Observers said that Seoul\u2019s decision might have sent a signal to the U.S. that in future arms deals, it would prioritize cost-effectiveness and overall utility issues rather than allowing political and diplomatic factors to affect its key procurement decisions.\u201cI am a little cautious to comment as details of the negotiation process are not available. But this time, South Korea placed its top priority on the costs and practical utility aspects though they are also aware of the importance of the alliance factors,\u201d said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.\u201cThe decision may help raise South Korea\u2019s bargaining power in future negotiations over the purchase of expensive U.S. military equipment.\u201dSome critics have claimed that in some cases, U.S. dealers have raised prices of their products much higher than initially proposed, thinking that Seoul would put its top priority on factors related to interoperability with U.S. forces. They added that Tuesday\u2019s decision would allow South Korea to diversify its options to purchase high-tech military equipment. According to the annual Global Defense Trade Report of the research institute IHS, South Korea was the world\u2019s seventh-largest importer of defense equipment in 2014. But, nearly 80 percent of the country\u2019s imports came from the U.S.Some analysts noted that if the summit between President Park Geun-hye and her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama had been held as scheduled last month, Seoul might have put more stress on the alliance factors in its decision over the tanker project.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","370":"Parliamentary leaders of the member countries to MIKTA, a consultative body comprising emerging middle powers, gathered in Seoul on Wednesday to enhance coordination on global issues ranging from climate change to East Asian security.MIKTA -- an acronym of the member countries Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Australia -- was formed under the lead of Seoul in 2013.

Earlier this year, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea visited Ehwa Womans University \u2015 the first major institute to raise the tuition to the government-permitted limit of 2.4 percent \u2015 after which the school abruptly said it would freeze the fees. According to the Korea Council of University Education, 174 of Korea\u2019s 176 universities either froze or reduced their tuition fees for the first semester of 2015.\u201cThe burden of tuition fees in Korea is still high for most people. As a minister, I feel hard-pressed to suggest we remove that curb (on tuition hike),\u201d Hwang said during a seminar with heads of the country\u2019s leading universities last Thursday. Hwang said Korean universities still relies heavily on tuition for their finances, with fees accounting for 62.6 percent of their budgets on average.Instead of relying on tuition, Hwang said each university should look to make profits off their school funds, such as by starting their own businesses. A total of 156 private universities in Korea received 379.1 billion won ($336.7 million) in donations in 2013, according to this year\u2019s report by the Korea Higher Education Research Institute.

The Incheon city government agreed to extend the use of its landfill site for the capital and Gyeonggi Province to dump their household waste in exchange for financial benefits. The landfill site was set to close by next year as it was expected to be full by then. The landfill site of 16 million square meters was built in western Incheon in 1992 to bury the waste from the capital and Gyeonggi Province. The Environment Ministry and Seoul City purchased the land to solve the waste problem. Seoul City, Gyeonggi Province and the Environment Ministry asked Incheon last year to extend the land use for 30 more years, as the landfill site was deemed sufficient to accommodate the waste until then. Less than half of the site has been filled, as the amount of trash has been reduced by the nationwide volume-rate disposal system, which requires residents to purchase and use specialized trash bags.The Incheon government had declined the request, citing public complaints over odors. Upon the Sunday negotiation, the regional leaders agreed to use the current landfill site until it reaches half capacity. In the meantime, Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province promised to construct their own landfill sites in their regions, officials said. If the two fail to build their alternative landfill sites, Incheon said it would allow them to use up to 15 percent of the second half of the current landfill site. Some claimed that this practically allows Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province to use Incheon\u2019s landfill site until 2025. While Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok claimed that the core of the latest deal is not the extension of the use, but a negotiation to construct alternative landfill sites in other cities, some argued that Yoo virtually allowed other regional governments to indefinitely use Incheon\u2019s landfill site. \u201cThe agreement does not specify or guarantee the exact expiration date of the landfill site use. Depending on the type of the waste landfill, the capital and Gyeonggi Province can use it for 10 or 20 more years, which actually indicates that the mayor succumbed to the other regions\u2019 original request,\u201d said Incheon city council members of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. Civic groups in Incheon urged Yoo to nullify the agreement, stressing that they would continue their protest against the contract extension.\u201cThe agreement is only full of measures set for extending the landfill site use. This is apparently the mayor\u2019s attempt to shift his responsibility for building landfill alternative plans to the next term leader,\u201d said residents living near the concerned landfill site. Some raised suspicion that Yoo accepted the agreement to overcome the city\u2019s financial crisis. As of late last year, Incheon was buried under 4.8 trillion won ($4.2 billion) in debt after hosting the Asian Games earlier in the year. The city\u2019s debt-to-budget ratio hit 37.5 percent, the highest figure among metropolitan cities and provinces in the country, officials said.In return for allowing the extension of the landfill site use, Seoul City and the ministry offered to hand over the license rights of the landfill site and its land ownership worth 1.8 trillion won to Incheon. Currently, 71.3 percent of the landfill site shares are owned by Seoul City, with the rest owned by the ministry. They also vowed to transfer the authority to collect waste commission fees worth 120 billion won a year to Incheon. The commission rate is expected to hike by 50 percent starting next year, providing 60 billion won of additional revenue to Incheon.

Executing the most mundane task of giving the children an allowance is becoming more of a feat each day.(Yonhap)Kim is one of the estimated 5 million low-wage workers who have been pleading for a drastic hike in the minimum wage next year to receive \u201cwhat they deserve\u201d for their labor.\u00a0According to government statistics, 1 in 4 wage workers in Korea is \u201cworking poor,\u201d suffering from in-work poverty, with 2 million of them being paid less than the minimum wage.Korea joins the legion of economies that toils in the recurrent debate over the efficacy of minimum wage in encouraging low-wage workers to become self-sufficient.Business leaders and economists here view it as an obstacle to economic recovery, while unionized workers see it as a key to economic growth.\u00a0The Korea Employers Federation has argued that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses.\u00a0On the other hand, the nation\u2019s largest trade unions \u2015 the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Federation of Korean Trade Unions \u2015 have maintained that the hike would tackle the nation\u2019s income inequality and spur consumer spending.Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of labor experts, employees and employers, has set the minimum wage through discussion.\u00a0This year, the discussion began on June 2 to decide the minimum wage for next year with an aim to reach a conclusion by June 29. After the committee turns in its consensus proposal, the government will officially make the rate public in August.\u00a0But the labor circle and business bloc have continued to clash over the extent of the increase, casting a shadow over the passage of the proposal for next year\u2019s minimum wage within a legal deadline.\u00a0The labor unions have demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won to 10,000 won, while employers have campaigned for a freeze.\u201cThe higher minimum wage is necessary to narrow the income gap and guarantee a basic standard of living for low-wage workers, which is also key to boosting the domestic economy,\u201d the Federation of Korean Trade Unions said in a press release, calling on the business leaders to withdraw its proposal for a freeze.\u00a0The union claimed that companies have unfairly benefited from the low minimum wage, citing that household income only increased by 5.7 percent on average when companies\u2019 profits rose by an average of 9.8 percent from 2001-2013.\u00a0Yi Jung-ah, a researcher at local socioeconomic think tank Institute For New Society, also backed the claims.\u00a0\u201cThe pay raise will lead to economic growth in the long run by giving the low-income workers purchasing power as Korea\u2019s growth model is wage-led, not profit-led,\u201d Yi told The Korea Herald, citing a report by the International Labor Office released in 2012.\u00a0In the report, the ILO categorized Korea\u2019s economy as a wage-led growth model, meaning that it is more efficient for Korea to drive economic growth by raising workers\u2019 wages rather than helping companies make profits.\u00a0\u201cThrough research, I found that the poor tend to spend rather than save when they get extra money,\u201d Yi said. \u201cThis means that the minimum wage increase could be the most powerful way to spur domestic spending here.\u201d\u00a0The increase can also prompt the employers to reduce working hours per person, which could create more jobs in the market, she added.\u00a0But the employers association has protested the unionized workers\u2019 proposal, saying that such drastic increase in the minimum wage could pose a formidable threat to small and medium-sized enterprises that are already faltering amid prolonged economic downturn.\u00a0\u201cThe labor unions\u2019 suggestion of a 70 percent jump in the minimum wage is unrealistic,\u201d So Han-sub, an official from the Korea Federation of SMEs, told The Korea Herald.\u00a0\u201cThe government has already raised the minimum wage too much and too quickly for the past decade, despite worsening business conditions, taking\u00a0a\u00a0toll on employers.\u201d he said.The minimum wage has risen by an average of 8.8 percent from 1,865 won in 2001 to 5,580 won this year, with inflation increasing by 2.9 percent during the same period.\u00a0\u201cLabor is the biggest cost for small and medium-sized employers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all the companies go bankrupt (due to the wage hike), where would workers find a job?\u201dAccording to a survey of 429 SMEs by Korea Employers Federation and Korea Federation of SMEs, more than half of the companies responded that they would lay off workers or not recruit new employees if the minimum wage were to increase.\u00a0The surveyed companies also responded that 67.3 percent of their employees take home more than 1.6 million won per month, including bonuses and overtime pay, nearly 50 percent more than the monthly minimum wage.\u00a0Choi Chang-kyu, an economics professor at Myeongji University, also thinks that the raised minimum wage has deterred companies from creating new jobs due to growing costs, resulting in fewer jobs for the young.\u00a0\u201cThe shortage of jobs for the young is partially due to the constantly raised minimum wage,\u201d Choi told The Korea Herald. \u201cWhen the government intervenes in the labor market and sets the minimum wage higher than the market demands, the labor market stops the young from entering the labor force.\u201dThe unemployment rate for the young stood at 9.3 percent in May, significantly higher than the overall rate of 3.8 percent.Putting aside the effect of a pay raise on the domestic economy, another focal point in the wrangling between the labor and business bloc is whether to cover living costs of laborers\u2019 families in the minimum wage.\u00a0\u201cIt is not realistic for workers to live on the minimum wage in Korea while supporting their families,\u201d Kim Jong-jin, a researcher for Korea Labor & Society Institute, told The Korea Herald.\u00a0\u201cThe minimum wage is a part of social welfare policy to tackle income disparity and ensure a basic living standard for the marginalized,\u201d Kim said, opposing employers\u2019 perception that workers should be paid in accordance with the amount of work they put in.\u00a0According to OECD data, a Korean single parent with two children at a minimum wage job in 2013 would need to work 58 hours a week to earn 50 percent of the median household income in Korea and get above the poverty line. The 58 hours ranks as the third most, behind the Czech Republic and Greece, among 25 OECD countries that have adopted the minimum wage system.\u00a0Based on the data, the labor unions have claimed that the current minimum wage is far lower than the amount of money needed to support a family.\u00a0The current minimum wage, which translates to 44,640 won a day and 1.16 million won a month for those who work eight hours a day, makes up 70 percent of the actual living expenses for a single household and only 32 percent of the living wages for a three-member household, according to labor unions.\u00a0This means that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for one person in family to support the rest of its members, they said.\u00a0But economics professor Choi noted that raising living conditions for workers and distributing wealth is the government\u2019s job to do, not that of companies.\u00a0\u201cThe government appears to pass the responsibility to take care of Koreans on to companies,\u201d Choi said. \u201cRather than putting the burden on employers, the government should encourage them to create more jobs and put more people back to work.\u201dWhile the management and labor circle are bickering over the extent of the wage hike, more focus should be on the social and economic structures that distress SMEs in the first place, the researcher Kim pointed out.\u00a0\u201cBeyond discussing how much to raise in the minimum wage, we should think about why SMEs are under pressure to keep their costs to a minimum in the first place,\u201d Kim said.\u00a0\u201cIt is not the minimum wage spike that puts a strain on small companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the unfair business practices between conglomerates and themselves that threaten their businesses.\u201dDespite the government\u2019s pledge to curb family-owned conglomerates\u2019 power and foster smaller businesses, large companies have been accused of exploiting SMEs, which are often their suppliers, by cutting costs or pushing them out of business with their economies of scale.\u00a0Kim Dong-kyu, an owner of cafe Bom Bom in southwestern Seoul, agreed. \u201cIn the short term, it could be difficult for us to cope with the rising costs to hire part-timers, but in the long term, I also think that the minimum wage should increase,\u201d Kim told The Korea Herald.\u00a0\u201cWhat we (small businesses) fear more than the minimum wage increase is conglomerates who are expanding their businesses into every street, threatening small and independent shops,\u201d he said.\u00a0But behind the intensifying feud over how much to raise the minimum wage may be a more systematic problem: a lack of legal institution that allows the management and labor circles to \u201creasonably\u201d discuss the issue.\u00a0\u201cThe dispute over the minimum wage between laborers and business leaders repeats every year, with labor unions going as far as to stage strikes and protests,\u201d Park Ji-soon, professor at Korea University Law School, told The Korea Herald.\u00a0For the same statistics and data, the labor and business bloc have used different measurement methods, which often result in different understandings of the status of the current minimum wage in global rankings and the effects the wage hike would have on the local economy.\u00a0\u201cThere should be a more systematic framework and common indicators to be used when setting the minimum wage,\u201d Park said. \u201cSuch an important policy for the public good should not be a subject of political bargaining.\u201dBy Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","394":"Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se urged North Korea Thursday to return to stalled multilateral negotiations on its nuclear dismantlement, citing ongoing talks for an Iranian nuclear deal.\"North Korea is the only country to have conducted nuclear weapons tests in the 21st century,\" he said in an address to a meeting of the Group of Eminent Persons for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\"Despite international efforts, it is going down a misguided and anachronistic path, arguing that it can have both guns and butter.\"Yun also urged North Korea to sign and ratify the CTBT, saying its nuclear weapons programs present a serious challenge to the global nonproliferation regime.The CTBT, which opened for signing in 1996, has yet to come into force because eight nations with nuclear capabilities, including North Korea, Iran, and the U.S., have been reluctant to sign or ratify the deal.Iran, however, is nearing a deal to curb its nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief with the so-called P5+1 comprised of the U.S., China, Russia, France, Germany and Britain.\"Pyongyang would do well to take a lesson from the Iranian case and return to the dialogue table,\" Yun said. \"Nukes bring nothing but isolation and sanctions.\"The six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program have been stalled since late 2008.

The new terminal is expected to be used for international flights while an existing terminal may be transferred to that for domestic flights.The KCNA said that Kim was \"very satisfied\" to see the terminal was well built in harmony with modern aesthetic taste and national character.It added that Kim commanded a bird's-eye view of the terminal from his plane, together with his wife Ri Sol-ju.In November last year, Kim inspected the construction site of the terminal, instructing officials to modify the structure to highlight national identity.Kim reportedly purged Ma Won-chun, director of the designing department at the North's powerful National Defense Commission, holding him accountable for the failure to boost national character in the terminal from the beginning.The North's leader also instructed officials to build a high-speed railway and motorway to ensure that traffic could move smoothly from the airport to the central areas of Pyongyang.

He was also grilled over a golf trip he took shortly after a North Korean land mine injured two South Korean troops in August.Controversy has been brewing after the 61-year-old Army general was found to have described former President Park Chung-hee\u2019s 1961 coup as a \u201cmilitary revolution\u201d in his master\u2019s thesis in 2001. Facing a relay of demands by opposition lawmakers for a clear explanation, Lee simply responded that it was \u201cinappropriate to display a personal opinion\u201d and that he had a \u201cfirm belief in political neutrality.\u201d As the lawmakers called for a recess in protest against his repeated refusal to give an answer, Rep. Chung Doo-un of the ruling Saenuri Party who chairs the National Assembly\u2019s defense committee adjourned the morning session early.\u00a0 Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman designate Lee Sun-jin (right) reviews documents during a parliamentary hearing at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Lee, however, said later in the day that he respects the portrayal by a state history compilation committee of the 1961 takeover as a military coup, and by the Supreme Court of the Dec. 12, 1979, upheaval by former President Chun Doo-hwan as a military rebellion. The former chief of the Army\u2019s 2nd Operations Command became the JCS chairman designate last month as the first-ever Army Academy graduate. If he secures parliamentary endorsement and then presidential approval, he will succeed Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, whose two-year stint has come to an end. Lee also apologized for playing golf only days after two Army staff sergeants were critically wounded in a mine blast while patrolling the southern part of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone in Paju, Gyeonggi Province.His golf trip coincided with the JCS\u2019 unveiling that the mines were deliberately planted by North Korean troops who had crossed the border. In his defense, the general said he did not know about the findings at the time but his comment rather fueled criticism, given heightened tension that brought the two Koreas to the brink of an armed clash. \u201cEven though I was not aware of the situation, I admit that it was not thoughtful for a commander to play golf,\u201d Lee said. Should North Korea attack a border island again, the JCS will retaliate against its origin with additional weaponry including warplanes, Lee said. \u201cA strike on the origin involving fighters can be extra,\u201d he said, when Saenuri Rep. Yoo Seung-min pointed out that the South only mobilized K-9 self-propelled howitzers during Pyongyang\u2019s shelling on Yeonpyeongdo Island in 2010 which killed two civilians and more than a dozen soldiers. \u201cAs the JCS chairman, I will instruct joint forces to hit the target.\u201d On Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear capability, he said it is estimated to have a stockpile of highly enriched uranium and been working on miniaturizing its atomic devices, but the scale of the warhead arsenal or any of their deployment remains unconfirmed. Lee also reiterated that it will be \u201chelpful\u201d for the U.S. Forces Korea to station advanced missile defense assets on the peninsula but South Korea has currently no plan to adopt them.\u201cThe decision on any stationing will be made based on our own needs and national interests,\u201d he added.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","398":"On the back of new momentum for thawing ties, South Korea and Japan are to expedite exchanges and cooperation in defense fields, Defense Ministry officials said Wednesday.Such moves come after the leaders of the neighboring countries called for progress earlier this week in bilateral relations long weighed down by history issues.\"Working-level talks for policy coordination between officials of the defense ministries are planned this fall,\" an official said.\"The planned meeting is meant to assess security threats posed by North Korea and how to boost defense cooperation for next year,\" the official said, adding that it will also be the venue for the two nations to discuss follow-up measures after their defense ministers' talks last month.On the sidelines of the Asia Security Summit in Singapore in May, Defense Minister Han Min-koo met with his Japanese counterpart, Gen Nakatani, and agreed to deepen defense ties by actively pushing for dialogue on key pending military issues.

Kim Han-gil had accepted illegal funds from the late Sung Woan-jong. Kim was the first head of the newly minted New Politics Alliance for Democracy party in 2014, a party formed by combining progressive groups, mainly from the Democratic Party.Prosecutors say Kim accepted illegal funds from Sung days before the DP\u2019s convention in May 2013 when Kim was elected as the party chairman. Kim denied the charges, which he called, \u201cridiculous,\u201d later Tuesday.Prosecutors also suspect that Geon-pyeong accepted illegal money from Sung in 2007.

But hours before his death he revealed a list of ruling bloc officials he had allegedly given bribes to, sparking a public firestorm against the Park administration.The list included former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, former Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and South Gyeongsang Province Gov.

Kim Han-gil and Roh Geon-pyeong were not included in that list.None have been convicted, but Lee resigned in April amid growing public suspicion that he had accepted illegal campaign funds from Sung during the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections.But the scandal quickly turned against the opposition, when allegations arose that officials in the Roh Moo-hyun administration had allegedly received bribes from Sung. Many leading figures of the NPAD began their political careers under the Roh administration.Prosecutors say Sung and Kim were close.

(Yonhap)As of Monday, the number of people in isolation for suspected cases came to 3,833, down from 4,035 on the previous day. So far, some 9,300 people have been released from isolation after they showed no symptoms of MERS for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.\u00a0\u00a0However, one of the three new cases involved a patient who apparently was diagnosed after nearly three weeks following his or her alleged contact with a MERS patient late last month.\u00a0\u00a0The health ministry said it will not extend the period of isolation for suspected cases, noting the person began showing minor symptoms of MERS as early as June 9, well within the maximum incubation period of 14 days.\u00a0\u00a0Ministry officials claimed only the person's diagnosis came belatedly, though it should have been made much earlier.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, the country's death toll from the disease is 27.

(Yonhap)","414":"Despite the slowing number of new cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome, the public fear over the deadly disease continued to cause a significant change to life across South Korea, creating rare scenes that no one could have expected a month before. Since the authorities confirmed the first case of a patient with the virus on May 20, the nation has fallen into a deeper state of panic with each passing day, pushing the people to change their life patterns to best prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario \u2015 the virus being transmitted to the general community.From school buses filled with children and teachers donning masks, to empty streets in the evenings with many grown-ups canceling dinner gatherings in order to return home as soon as possible, a growing number of South Koreans are fast adapting themselves to a new environment. Washing hands frequently and avoiding the public areas as much as possible have become a \u201cmust\u201d daily ritual for many, not just because of the government\u2019s repeated guideline but also because of people\u2019s voluntary sense of self-protection raised to block the virus\u2019 spread.The most affected area of society is the nation\u2019s medical sector, with people refraining to visit if not suffering from life-threatening illnesses.\u00a0 A woman walks on a street in Myeong-dong, a popular area for both local shoppers and foreign tourists, in central Seoul, Saturday. (Yonhap)After it was announced that nearly all MERS-confirmed patients were found to have caught the virus at medical facilities, non-MERS patients who need to see doctors on a regular basis refuse to visit the medical facilities. \u201cMy mom hasn\u2019t seen the doctor since MERS hit the country, although she really needs to go for her kidney problem. She says she won\u2019t go until the government officially announces that the virus is subsiding,\u201d said 28-year-old office worker Yoon Hee-sik. \u201cSome have joked that there will be more deaths from avoiding doctors than by MERS.\u201d Both small and large hospitals have seen a drop in outpatient visits, regardless of whether they were hit by MERS. \u201cOur number of patients fell by 20 percent in a month. No matter how much effort we put into cleaning and sterilization measures, they just do not visit,\u201d said an oriental medical doctor in the capital who wished to remain anonymous. Many tended to avoid wedding ceremonies, especially who raise toddlers or are pregnant, citing the virus concerns. If necessary, some show up in protective masks. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m worried about the virus, I couldn\u2019t miss my sister\u2019s wedding this weekend. So I wore a mask throughout the whole ceremony,\u201d said Jeong Eun-young, who is seven months pregnant. Other business sectors have also suffered from the aftermath of MERS.According to a survey conducted on some 650 restaurants by the Korea Food Service Industry Management Institute, average sales in early June plummeted by nearly 40 percent compared to before the MERS crisis.\u201cGroup reservations sharply dropped. The main source of my business is group dinners but many regular customers have canceled,\u201d said a 29-year-old surnamed Song, who owns a restaurant in Gangnam, Seoul. As people tend to call off group dinner plans, the number of drunk driving accidents has also dropped. According to data by the National Police Agency, the number of drunk driving accidents fell to about 600 cases in the first half of this month, down 41 percent than the same period last year. The police have suspended drunk driving crackdowns near MERS-hit hospitals as part of its efforts to support virus-containment work. \u201cEven without crackdowns conducted in June, the drunk driving accident rate dropped, which indicates that the public concerns over MERS is serious,\u201d said Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. On the other hand, the food delivery business has seen a sharp rise in sales. According to the food delivery application Baedal Minjok, the number of app users surged by 23 percent on June 13-14 compared to two weeks ago. The tourism industry, which was firstly hit by MERS, still faces difficulties. Jejudo Island was most recently hit, after the 141st MERS patient was found to have toured the island despite having some symptoms. While the quarantine authorities immediately isolated those who closely contacted the patient, and took preventive measures, public concerns remained. The number of Jejudo tourists on June 19-20 declined by 13 percent compared to last year, according to the Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Tourism Association. The flight booking rate between Seoul and Jejudo halved while the accommodation reservation rate plummeted by 40 to 50 percent, it added.The overall tourism industry, however, is seeing a gradual recovery. The growth in travel cancellations to Seoul is reportedly slowing as the virus outbreak subsides. According to the state-run Korea Tourism Organization, about 1,800 foreign travelers called off their trips to South Korea on Friday, only up 1.43 percent from that of the previous day. The figure is lower than the number of cancellations Wednesday, which exceeded 3,700, rising by 3.15 percent from the day before. From June 1-18, a total of 123,390 foreign travelers canceled their trips, with the majority from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. While the KTO said that the foreign tourists who booked flights in July and August seem to be cautiously watching the situation in Korea, it projected that the number of tourists could tumble by up to 30 percent this month.

The newly infected had been on the government\u2019s MERS watch after they were in close contact with confirmed MERS patients,As of Sunday morning, 43 MERS patients have made a full recovery and were discharged from their hospitals. A total of 101 are still being treated, 14 of whom are in unstable condition.The government also confirmed the death of a 63-year-old MERS patient on Saturday evening, who had a history of diabetes and myocardial ischemia.Of the 25 lives claimed by MERS, 18 were men. Nine of the victims were in their 60s, while eight were in their 70s. The youngest MERS victim was aged 49.All but four MERS-related fatalities had preexisting medical conditions.About 18.9 percent of the 169 MERS patients were local medical staff, while the rest were either patients already at a hospital -- 46.2 percent -- or their visitors or family members.The virus infected more men than women -- 61.5 percent to 38.5 percent -- and 50-somethings were the most severely hit age group with 20.7 percent.As of Sunday, 4,035 people remained in quarantine for possible infection. It marked a 1,162 drop from the day before, indicating that the worst may be over for the outbreak in the country.Outside of Saudi Arabia, where the disease was first reported in 2012, Korea has the highest number of MERS cases in the world.\u00a0The World Health Organization conducted a joint investigation last week with the Korean government on the country\u2019s MERS situation and concluded that the outbreak in Korea did not meet the standards for a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d This refers to a situation posing risk to fellow WHO member states while calling for coordinated international response.While it echoed the government\u2019s stance that there was no evidence of MERS being spread to the general public, the WHO said the outbreak was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d that demonstrates all countries should be on the lookout for the rapid spreading of an infectious disease.The Health Ministry said that experts in infectious disease from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will visit Korea for \u201ctechnical cooperation\u201d with local experts on the MERS situation. The ministry is aiming to rein in the outbreak by end-June.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","421":"Almost a month after the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome was confirmed in South Korea, the outbreak is showing signs of losing steam, the nation\u2019s health officials announced Friday.Korea marked the lowest daily increase of confirmed MERS cases Friday since June 3. The number of those quarantined also dropped significantly, to 5,930 from 6,729 the day before.The Health Ministry confirmed only one new case Friday, as well as one MERS death, which raised the death toll to 24. The fatality rate remained 14.5 percent of as of Friday afternoon. More than 90 percent of the deceased either had preexisting medical conditions, especially lung or kidney diseases, or were aged 50 or older.Medical workers check visitors\u2019 temperature at a hospital in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)Among the 166 confirmed cases, 112 of them are currently being treated at medical facilities, while 16 are in unstable condition. A total of 30 patients have fully recovered and been discharged.Also among all confirmed patients, 98.8 percent were infected at health care facilities. The largest number of them -- 49 percent -- were exposed to the virus at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul. The newly confirmed patient is also believed to have been infected at Samsung Medical Center, where 81 others were exposed to the virus previously. Most of the 81 patients were infected at the facility\u2019s emergency room, where the 14th confirmed patient -- considered a \u201csuperspreader\u201d -- stayed from May 27-30.The 166th patient, however, stayed at the hospital\u2019s non-emergency unit, from May 25 to June 5 to nurse his wife who had been receiving treatment there as an inpatient. The 62-year-old is the fifth to be confirmed as a MERS patient infected at the Samsung Medical Center\u2019s non-emergency facility. A radiation therapist and a nurse, who were serving at the hospital but not at its emergency room, have also been confirmed as MERS patients. An outpatient who visited the hospital\u2019s orthopedics clinic, as well as a man who accompanied another outpatient to see a urologist at the hospital, have also been infected by the virus in the past.\u00a0 The nation\u2019s 137th confirmed patient was an ambulance worker at the hospital, who was working on a contract basis and therefore hadn\u2019t been provided with safety gear. These cases, along with the 166th, indicate that Samsung Medical Center\u2019s inpatients and visitors may have been exposed to the virus even if they were not staying at the hospital\u2019s emergency room, and it is possible that additional cases will be identified as having been infected there. To tackle the situation, the Health Ministry said it would contact a total of 41,930 individuals who either stayed or visited the hospital from May 27 to early this month to conduct a survey for further research.\u201cWe are currently investigating how the 166th patient was exposed to the virus while staying at Samsung Medical Center,\u201d said Jeong Eun-kyung from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry.\u00a0\"One of the possibilities is that he was infected by the 137th patient, who was the ambulance worker, but nothing can be confirmed at this moment.\u201dHealth authorities also announced that they were banning another Seoul-based hospital, where one of the confirmed MERS patients was staying along with other patients with kidney diseases, from receiving any more inpatients starting Friday. The medical facility, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, is where more than 100 patients may have been exposed to MERS while receiving kidney dialysis -- a blood treatment for patients with kidney failure -- along with the 165th confirmed patient from June 9-18. Health authorities also announced that a total of 17 patients, currently quarantined at Asan Chungmu Hospital in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, will be moved to another facility to be isolated more safely. The hospital was shut down and all of its inpatients were quarantined in the same property on Thursday, after one of its nurses was diagnosed with MERS the day before. The remaining 48 patients will each be placed in single patient rooms to be away from each other, authorities said.The ministry also announced on Friday that families of MERS patients will now be allowed to visit their sick relatives at the hospital, should their condition become critical and unrecoverable. All visitors, however, will be required to wear full safety gear, authorities said. The announcement came after a number of quarantined family members could not stand by their spouses or parents at their deathbeds to say goodbye and share their last words.The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said it would support health authorities by dispatching some 100 military surgeons and nurses, as well as some 200 medical officers and emergency relief agents from the Army Special Warfare Command, to help medical professionals currently in the workforce to control the outbreak at civilian hospitals. On Thursday, Dr. Margaret Chan, the director-general of World Health Organization, stressed that the public cooperation is critical in handling of the MERS situation, while assuring that the outbreak in Korea can be stopped. Her comments in Seoul came after a number of quarantined individuals did not follow the guidelines by leaving their houses and facilities. On Monday, the nation\u2019s 141st patient escaped quarantine at a Seoul-based hospital while waiting for his test results, by forcibly breaking the lock on the door. He took a cab and went home, and was eventually diagnosed with MERS and quarantined at another facility the next day.\u201cWhen individuals do not follow the advice and guidelines of the government, it is unfair to blame the government,\u201d Chan from WHO said.While Chan praised the Korean government\u2019s current efforts to combat the disease, the Journal of the American Medical Association pointed out that Seoul\u2019s inept response in the early stages of the outbreak, especially withholding the names of MERS-affected hospitals, may have contributed to public fear.It also stated that such fear and public mistrust in government can damage the process of handling such an infectious disease.\u201cTransparency builds public trust,\u201d wrote authors Lawrence O. Gostin and Daniel Lucey in their article \u201cMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Global Health Challenge\u201d published online in the JAMA. \u201cGiven inevitable scientific uncertainty, health authorities should fully disclose what is and is not known about the MERS-CoV outbreak.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","422":"A former Korean wartime sex slave said Friday she will soon file a suit against the Japanese government with a U.S. court, seeking an apology and financial compensation for the atrocities done by the Japanese military during World War II. Yoo Hee-nam, 87, will not only sue the Japanese government and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe but also seek damages from Japanese firms and a Japanese daily, said Ahn Shin-kwon, who heads House of Sharing in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, which houses a group of victims of sex slavery, quoting Yoo.The total amount of compensation she is seeking is $20 million.The firms she plans to sue are known for having mobilized millions of Koreans for forced labor during the war and have operations in the U.S.The Japanese daily, Sankei Shimbun, will also be sued for calling former sex slaves \"prostitutes\" in its articles, Ahn said in a telephone conversation with Yonhap News Agency.Yoo will try to convince the judges at a Californian district court that her sexual enslavement was a crime against humanity and Japan's repeated denial of it is rubbing salt into her wounds.More than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese soldiers during World War II, according to historians.The suit will be lodged in the U.S. as a court battle there would deal a heavier blow to Japan than in South Korea, Ahn said.The House of Sharing decided to start off with Yoo alone since a 2000 class-action suit against Japan in the U.S. ended in a loss.\"We considered the huge disappointment these former sex slaves would feel in case they filed a class-action suit and lost,\" Ahn said. \"I hope we will win in the U.S. so Japan can finally make a formal apology and properly compensate these former sex slaves.\"The South Korean government only has 238 sex slaves on file and of those, only 50 are still alive.

East Asia, on the other hand, has been mired in geopolitical tensions despite its integrated economies, a situation described as the \u201cAsian Paradox.\u201d The Asan Institute for Policy Studies, together with the German, French, Polish and British embassies, held the \u201cPost-WWII Reconciliation and Cooperation: Lessons for East Asia\u201d conference Wednesday, inviting diplomats and scholars to share Europe\u2019s lessons.\u00a0 British Ambassador Charles Hay (left) moderates a panel beside Etienne Rolland-Piegue (center), deputy head of mission of the French embassy, and Kent University professor Hugh Miall at the \u201cPost-WWII Reconciliation and Cooperation: Lessons for East Asia\u201d conference at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul on Wednesday. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)While acknowledging the different situation in East Asia, the participants voiced similar opinions on the need to sustain long-term political commitment and activate society for internal cohesion and external solidarity. For Germany, the end of the war meant defeat and division, along with liberation from the Nazi dictatorship, German Ambassador Rolf Mafael said in an opening speech.\u201cThe situation was clear. We had started the war and had to take responsibility for the horrendous crimes against Europeans and Jewish people,\u201d Mafael stressed. \u201cWe were also lucky in that our neighbors extended their hands of friendship to allow reconciliation to take place.\u201dGermany\u2019s reconciliatory approach involved political leadership and social correspondence with neighboring citizens. French President Charles de Gaulle took \u201cvisionary and courageous steps\u201d toward German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, building on the people exchanges from the 1950s. The two countries signed the Elysee Treaty in 1963 to forge friendship.Reconciling with Poland was more difficult, and took institutionalization and top-down leadership. \u201cBuilding consensus took 20 years of consistent approach by successive governments,\u201d the German ambassador noted, adding that the conservative government of Helmut Kohl inherited the policies of predecessors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt.Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka expressed his opinion that Europe\u2019s successful experience is possible in East Asia, and people should not labor the point of difference between Christianity and Confucianism as underlying values. \u201cWhat is important is respect for humanity, which exists in both systems,\u201d argued the Polish ambassador. Another lesson is that society-wide reconciliation should be encouraged, as it can create \u201ca momentum of its own\u201d to buttress state initiatives. Passing the buck to the government makes reconciliation diplomatic and compromise more difficult, he said.Majka recommended combining official apology, financial compensation, historical commemoration, joint education projects, student exchange, cultural events and municipal partnership, saying that diverse actors can bring diverse tactics. He also underscored the importance of arriving at a generational accord through dialogue and education. The deputy head of mission of the French embassy, Etienne Rolland-Piegue, said he learned the German language from elementary school and visited a German friend in Frankfurt every summer. He studied German philosophy and listened to German pop music as a teenager. \u201cThe French-German reconciliation served as a stepping stone for a larger European integration,\u201d the deputy head of mission said. \u201cWe don\u2019t use the word reconciliation anymore, because it is way past us. We talk about friendship and cooperation instead.\u201dFrench Culture and Communication Minister Fleur Pellerin, who was born in Korea but adopted in France as an infant, went to a French-German high school outside of Paris. University of Kent professor Hugh Miall said: \u201cReconciliation involves political risk-taking and persuasion to bring the society on board. It requires the whole society to come to terms with itself, sometimes reaching a new identity from that of a victim or perpetrator to fellow human beings.\u201d Unlike the Franco-German reconciliation, which was deep and immediate, the Anglo-German reconciliation took longer to be established, the professor said. Not until 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II visited Germany did the relations begin to thaw. Even into the 1980s and \u201990s, Britain\u2019s diplomatic moves to apologize for the bombing of Germany raised criticism from veterans. A full reconciliation with European partners has now taken place, according to the professor. \u201cAs Britain emerged the victor of the war, there was no need for Britain to change,\u201d Miall said. \u201cBut Germany needed a complete self-transformation to be accepted by its neighbors and regain sovereignty.\u201dIn consequence, Britain is currently undergoing identity transformations, as demonstrated by the rise of nationalist movements across the British Isles, he added. Mari Fitzduff of Brandeis University, Jakub Taylor of Warsaw University, Patrician Oster-Stierle of the Franco-German University, Lee Geun of Seoul National University and Lee Jae-hyon of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies spoke as panelists.

Computers used by those who work at the control center and power supplier were affected, raising safety concerns that the subway lines could have been exposed to potential terror threats.\"The computers that were hacked were only for office use, which is unrelated to the direct operation of the trains,\" officials from Seoul Metro said. \"After the probe by the NIS was done, we formatted all 4,240 computers for office use and reinforced our safety system.\"The NIS analyzed the hacking records from March 2014 to August 2014, but the date of the first attack and who carried it out are still unclear.The agency said the tactics used coincided with that of cyber attacks that took place in March 2013 by North Korea on three South Korean banks, their insurance affiliates and three TV broadcasters, raising suspicions that the North could be behind the attack.The Seoul Metro has been suffering from a series of cyber attacks. As of September 2015, more than 35,000 attacks have taken place this year, nearing the total 37,713 cases that took place last year.

Song Young-geun of the ruling Saenuri Party.\"On last Thursday and yesterday, the North Korean vessels retreated upon our warning messages. But its patrol boat that moved some 300 meters into our territorial waters last Friday was backed down only after our Navy fired warning shots twice,\" a JCS officer said.Between January and May this year, South Korea saw two cases of violations by North Korean vessels of the tense western sea border, once in April due to an engine failure and the other in May.\"They appear to have crossed the border while trying to clamp down on a growing number of fishing boats either of its own or from China,\" the officer said, adding that the military has closely watched the movements and sternly dealt with any infiltration. Pyongyang does not recognize the NLL, which was drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led United Nations Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War with the help of the overwhelming U.N. naval and air forces, and has demanded the line be drawn farther south. (Yonhap)","435":"The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said Tuesday that it would strengthen enforcement of traffic violations by foreign embassy vehicles in Korea in an effort to curb immunity and collect unpaid fines. Diplomats in Korea are obligated to pay penalties for traffic violations, but police enforcement over them has not been strict due to immunities granted by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which was signed in 1969. The number of traffic violations by Foreign Service workers has risen sharply over the last four years, rising from nine incidents in 2012 to 81 last year. The Korean police long relied on traffic enforcement cameras for surveillance of foreign service workers, but with the new measures, field crackdown is expected to be implemented with full force. The police will forward requests to the embassies regarding the matter. The countries that have fully paid the penalties are the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Japan. The countries that have registered the highest number of violations in the last three years are Russia (23), China (12), the U.S. (12) and Mongolia (10).By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","436":"South Korea and the United States signed a civilian nuclear energy cooperation agreement Monday, bringing a formal end to years of tough negotiations that had required the pushing back of an initial deadline.South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz signed the revision to the 1974 nuclear cooperation pact that mainly stipulates South Korea's obligations in exchange for receiving technical support and other nuclear cooperation from the U.S.In April, the two sides initialed the deal after winding up more than four years of negotiations that centered on reconciling Seoul's demand for the right to reprocess spent nuclear fuel and enrich uranium with Washington's concerns about proliferation. The new deal still bans Seoul from reprocessing and enrichment, but it opens the way for the Asian ally to begin research into a new technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling, known as \"pyroprocessing,\" and to make low-level enriched uranium with U.S. consent.Both Yun and Moniz called Monday's signing a \"historic moment.\"\"We feel that this new agreement will upgrade our relations to a new height and -- thanks to this innovative, very much future-oriented agreement -- we will be able to work together in many new areas,\" Yun said during the ceremony at the Energy Department. \"This will get us securing a stable supply of nuclear fuel and manage spent fuel more efficiently and there are many areas where we can collaborate together in third countries. So this will give a big boost to Korean and American businesses as well,\" he said.Moniz emphasized South Korea and the U.S. are strong advocates for nonproliferation objectives.\"This agreement solidifies that again as we enter a new phase of our cooperation,\" he said. The secretary also said that the U.S.-Korea partnership is an \"absolute anchor\" for peace and stability in the region and the partnership cannot be stronger.Since the initialing, the two governments conducted legal and other internal reviews before South Korean President Park Geun-hye approved the deal in a Cabinet meeting on June 9 and U.S. President Barack Obama gave it a go-ahead last week.The two countries had originally planned to hold a signing ceremony during Park's visit to Washington that had been set for this week, but the plan fell through as she postponed the trip due to the massive outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea.Now that the agreement has been formally signed, the U.S. Congress will review the agreement for 90 congressional days, which could take up to six months, and the pact will go into effect if no opposition is raised during the process.Widespread views are that no objections will be raised.No legislative approval is necessary in South Korea, officials said.The two countries began negotiations in 2010 to renew the agreement that had originally been scheduled to expire in 2014.After failing to find a compromise, the two sides extended the existing agreement by two years to buy time for more negotiations.Meanwhile, Yun was scheduled to meet with U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice later in the day for talks that are expected to include rescheduling Park's visit to Washington, the North Korean nuclear standoff and other pending issues.\"We will push for a U.S. visit within the earliest possible time,\" Yun told reporters after the signing ceremony. \"We can say it will be within this year for us.\"Asked about North Korea's expression of willingness to hold government-level talks with the South, Yun said that the door for dialogue with Pyongyang is always open and the Seoul government will deal with the issue with an open-minded attitude.

North Korea has also kept in captivity three other men -- missionary Kim Jung-wook, Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil.Pyongyang has rejected Seoul's repeated demands for their repatriation, according to the ministry.

Moscow and Seoul are now close partners in an evolving multipolar international order, drawing on their respective leverage in East Asia and Europe.Since establishing diplomatic ties in 1990, over 50 interstate and intergovernmental agreements were concluded, 27 official summits were held and bilateral trade volume has reached $26 billion last year.\u00a0 Korea\u2019s First Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong (left) and Russian Ambassador Alexander Timonin at a reception marking the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Russia and Korea at the Russian Embassy on Thursday. Russian embassy\u201cToday, we are proud to declare that there is practically no area in which we do not interact, be it international security, trade, economy, energy, science and technology or humanities,\u201d Russian Ambassador Alexander Timonin said in a speech at a reception at the Russian Embassy on Thursday.\u201cOur mutually beneficial cooperation fully corresponds with the basic interests of our citizens, and provides for strengthening peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia,\u201d he said. According to Timonin, a vital component of the bilateral relationship rests in securing regional peace and stability through Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization, by faithfully applying the joint statement from the six party talks in September 2005, which sought to dismantle the North\u2019s nuclear program. A career diplomat for over 35 years, Timonin, 63, has developed expertise in regional security and multilateral economic cooperation with a focus on Korea and Northeast Asia, according to the embassy. He participated in the six-party talks as a deputy head of the Russian delegation from 2004-06, and authored several books and articles on the related matters.He was an ambassador to North Korea prior to his post here, which began at the beginning of this year. He also served as a minister-counselor in Seoul from 2000-04 and 2006-11.\u201cI would like to also note,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Russia always stands for the normalization of inter-Korean relations, and supports by practical steps the aspirations of the two Korean states for a peaceful unification.\u201d Recent high-level exchanges involved Russia\u2019s chairman of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin, who visited Korea in May, Russia\u2019s Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, who came to Korea in September, and Korea\u2019s National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, who is currently touring Russia.Noting the efforts to push forward large-scale economic projects in Russia\u2019s resource-rich Far East that would involve Russia, North Korea and South Korea, Timonin stressed that South Korean investors would receive \u201cfavorable conditions\u201d for participation. Russia, China, Mongolia and South Korea have been working together through an intergovernmental cooperation mechanism called the \u201cGreater Tumen Initiative,\u201d launched in 1992 under the United Nations Development Program. The initiative aims to transform the Tumen River Area bordering Russia, China and North Korea into a regional hub of sustainable development, encompassing trade and investment, energy, tourism, transport and environmental conservation. The region has rich reserves of oil, gas, coal and metal as well as timber and marine life. The two Koreas and Russia have also been collaborating on the Rajin-Khasan project, designed to turn North Korea\u2019s northeastern city of Rajin into a logistics hub and link it with Russia\u2019s nearby township of Khasan through the Trans-Siberian Railway. At the Asia-Europe Meeting Symposium in Seoul in early September, Korean President Park Geun-hye encouraged cooperation among Russia, the U.S., China and South Korea to develop a transport and logistics network linking Europe and Asia, in a bid to reinforce Korea\u2019s foreign policy centerpiece the \u201cEurasia Initiative.\u201dIn a speech at the reception, Korea\u2019s First Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong emphasized that Korea\u2019s Eurasia Initiative and Russia\u2019s Far East and Siberian development plans would create synergy, bolstering Eurasia\u2019s shared prosperity. \u201cThanks to the Eurasia Express, Korean people have become more interested in the Eurasia Initiative, feeling much closer to Russia,\u201d Cho said, referring to the 20-day, 14,400-kilometer intercontinental railway journey from Vladivostok and Beijing to Berlin in July, joined by 150 participants.The minister also touched on Korea\u2019s supranational diplomacy plan, the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative, expressing Seoul\u2019s willingness to partner Russia in solving nuclear safety, environment, health and disaster relief challenges. \u201cWe hope that Russia continues to play a constructive role in fostering peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and contributing to our peaceful unification,\u201d Cho added.\u00a0 The Russian embassy held a concert dedicated to 25 years of diplomatic relations with Korea on Sept. 24 at the Russian embassy.

A 61-year-old man died on Sunday afternoon while receiving treatment at a hospital in the southern port city of Busan, according to a city official.\u00a0 (Yonhap)The latest victim is believed to have come down with the virus after visiting a relative at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, who had been sharing the same hospital ward with a MERS patient at the time.Busan city officials said the man did not have any other special health conditions, aside from having weak liver function. The latest fatality has pushed up the number of MERS-related deaths to 15 since the respiratory illness was first confirmed in the country on May 20.Of the seven new patients confirmed earlier on Sunday, four were infected while visiting or being treated at Samsung Medical Center, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.The hospital has been identified as a major source of infection as nearly half of those diagnosed with the respiratory illness are believed to have been infected while visiting the hospital in the capital.On late Saturday, the hospital announced its decision to partially shut down its operations. A hospital official later said the temporary shutdown will be effective at least until June 24.Following a mass number of infections at the Seoul hospital, some hospitals reportedly have refused to treat or accept patients who have been to Samsung Medical Center.Health ministry officials said refusing to provide treatment to those who have been to Samsung hospital may be punishable under the medical law that prohibits unauthorized rejections to treat those in need of medical attention.Out of the seven new cases, two were believed to have been infected at two different hospitals while one is believed to have caught the disease while accompanying a MERS patient in an ambulance.The government had maintained all transmissions had occurred at hospitals that had housed a MERS patient, mostly unknowingly.This had given some assurance that people outside of hospitals may still be safe from the potentially deadly disease.Ministry officials noted, however, that no longer may be the case after an ambulance driver who had transported two MERS patients last week was diagnosed Saturday.The World Health Organization also warned the country to brace for a drawn-out battle against MERS.\"Because the outbreak has been large and is complex, more cases should be anticipated,\" Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director-general of WHO, told a press conference on Saturday.The WHO official had led a joint response team of WHO and South Korean officials to identify the source and factors driving the outbreak here. The team's four-day investigation came to an end Friday.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, some 1,100 cases had been confirmed throughout the world until the outbreak here was confirmed on May 20.Some 4,850 people were in isolation as of Sunday for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients, according to the ministry.Out of those diagnosed, 10 have been released from the hospital following complete recoveries with another patient expected to be discharged later in the day, ministry officials said.What the government has labeled groundless fears against MERS were apparently taking a toll on the local economy as many people were beginning to avoid visiting not only hospitals but any public places.The Finance Ministry earlier said it will provide up to 400 billion won ($358 million) in emergency relief funds to businesses, including hospitals, and communities affected by MERS.On Sunday, the ministry said it will form a special task force to check the economic impact of MERS on a daily basis and come up with countermeasures.

Some people brought them in after rescuing them from an abusive environment, its director Kong Kyung-hee said, but others have been less kind, secretly dumping their pets at the shelter at night. In many cases, such abandoned pets are bitten to death by other dogs.Dogs wait in their enclosure at animal shelter Aerinwon in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. (Ock Hyun-ju\/The Korea Herald)\u201cSome cruel people throw their dogs out of car windows and run away. The dogs, who tend to return to their masters, chase after the cars and end up being run over,\u201d said Kong, cuddling and patting the dozens of dogs that surrounded her. Kong began taking in unwanted dogs 32 years ago. Now, more than 3,000 dogs are housed outdoors in wire cages at the shelter, with the number increasing each year. \u201cIt is difficult to accommodate the rising number of dogs with limited resources, but I cannot let them die on the streets or be put to death by the government,\u201d the 72-year-old woman said, who looks after abandoned pets with four staff while living in a small container house.\u201cPuppies are, of course, adorable when they are young. People mindlessly make emotional purchases, and easily ditch them when they start to misbehave, bark, lose their hair and fall ill,\u201d Kong said.According to government statistics, some 81,000 pets were abandoned in 2014, with the majority being dogs. Of these, only 31.4 percent were adopted and 13 percent were reclaimed by their owners, while 23 percent died in shelters and 22.7 percent were euthanized.The number of abandoned pets has dwindled from 101,000 in 2010 to 81,000 in 2014, but the decline hardly means that animal rights awareness has increased, activists here point out.\u201cThe culture of easily buying and giving up pets, the huge costs of medical treatment and food, conflicts with neighbors over dogs\u2019 barking and the hectic pattern of life in modern society are to blame for the discharging of pets,\u201d Song Joon-kyu, a researcher from think-tank The Seoul Institute, said at a forum on abandoned animals.It is the norm for Koreans to buy dogs from pet shops rather than adopt one from animal shelters as they tend to prefer dogs of \u201cpure\u201d breeds. In the pet shops, they can pick a dog of a certain breed, color and size for as little as 100,000 won ($90), like shopping for clothes. When shopping for dogs online, the prices are even lower. But it is not only about Koreans\u2019 pet-purchasing culture. There is a more fundamental problem: the supply of dogs exceeds demand.\u00a0Kong Kyung-hee, head of animal shelter Aerinwon, pets dogs around her inside the shelter, Wednesday. (Ock Hyun-ju\/The Korea Herald)\u201cThe root cause of dogs being abandoned is an industrial structure that enables people to easily purchase dogs from pet shops and throw them away,\u201d said Park Ana, an animal rights activist at Korea Animal Rights Advocates.\u201cThousands of unlicensed breeders are producing more pets than society can take in,\u201d Park said, accusing the government of failing to track down and clamp down on the illegal businesses. While the government does not actually have statistics available, more than 3,000 dog farms are thought to be illegally operating across the country to cater to the demand for dog meat and special breeds of pets, pro-animal activists claimed. Many of the dogs in Kong\u2019s Aerinwon were also brutally abused when they arrived. \u201cI recently rescued a dog from a dog farm, where she was forced to give birth to nearly 50 puppies in total,\u201d Kong said. \u201cWhen she first arrived at our shelter a month ago, she could not even walk.\u201d Such \u201cpuppy factories\u201d are notorious for inducing female dogs into heat to keep them producing puppies while locked in a small cage. \u201cThe key to promoting animals\u2019 rights lies in lowering the number of pets by regulating the illicit dog trading businesses,\u201d Park said. Under the Animal Protection Law, homeless animals found on the streets are rescued and transferred to some 368 animal shelters, either sponsored by the government or run directly by municipalities. The facilities then put up advertisements on the government\u2019s website for seven days to look for their owners. Unless they find their owners within 10 days of arrival, the shelters can put the dogs up for adoption. If not adopted, dogs are eventually put down, as the state-run shelters do not have enough money or space to keep the growing number of incoming animals. There are also hundreds of privately-run shelters like Kong\u2019s Aerinwon set up to rescue animals in danger of being euthanized. Running on donations, some private facilities grapple with a lack of funding and come under fire for offering poor conditions for dogs, which raises their own questions over animals\u2019 welfare. Thus, it is difficult to say whether euthanasia is good or bad from an animal-welfare perspective, said Cho Hee-kyung, head of the Korean Animal Welfare Association.\u201cThe question is whether dogs in such poor conditions (at some private facilities) can be happy just living,\u201d Cho said. \u201cSociety needs to address abandoned animals\u2019 rights, too.\u201d As part of campaign to prevent pet abandonment, the government enacted a new system in July 2014, requiring all pet owners to register dogs aged over three months on a government system. Those who fail to do so can face a fine of up to 400,000 won. Since the rule took effect, less than 890,000 pets have been registered nationwide, approximately 55 percent of the total estimated by the central government. \u201cThe pet registration system should be reinforced and all the pets should be microchipped so that the authorities can trace pet owners who abandon their furry friends,\u201d the activist Cho said. \u201cThe system is already in place, but is far from properly working.\u201d The government is aware of the situation. \u201cWe will partner with veterinarians and animal rights organizations to promote the system and raise awareness of why pets should be registered,\u201d said an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, who asked not to be named.\u201cBut some citizens say that the government should focus on expanding welfare for people, not animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere seems to be no broad consensus yet on animals\u2019 rights in Korean society.\u201d By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","443":"President Park Geun-hye and her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama agreed Friday to reschedule their postponed summit as soon as possible as Seoul seeks to forestall any fallout from her last-minute cancellation of her trip to Washington.

As the outbreak continued to spiral, controversy erupted over whether she should scrap the trip. Some ranking officials, including top diplomats, opposed a cancellation.

The allies initialed an amendment to their 1974 accord in April, paving the way for Seoul to pursue reprocessing spent fuel rods through nascent technology called pyroprocessing and enriching uranium to low levels on a limited, consensus-required basis. Obama endorsed the deal Thursday, which he said will promote \u201ccommon defense and security.\u201d \u201cI have determined that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security,\u201d Obama said in a memorandum for the secretary of state and the secretary of energy.\u201cI hereby approve the proposed agreement and authorize the secretary of state to arrange for its execution.\u201d After an official signing, the agreement will be sent to the U.S. Congress for a 90-day review, which means it may take up to six months. It will then take effect if it is not opposed.Park has already granted her approval and, unlike in the U.S., no parliamentary authorization is needed here for the pact to come into force.

Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in late November.\u00a0\u00a0The conference is meant to produce a legally binding deal on climate. Scientists have said heat-trapping gases are to blame for global warming.\u00a0\u00a0Park told Obama that she will make the utmost efforts, noting internal discussions are under way to finalize South Korea's long-term commitments to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0Options being considered in South Korea range from the minimum 14.7 percent to the maximum 31.3 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the country's business-as-usual level by 2030.

He was released from the hospital on June 4, but was readmitted to another hospital on June 5 after showing symptoms.If the authorities are right about the policeman being infected on May 31, it means he roamed through the general public for at least a full day.As of Thursday, Korea has reported 10 MERS-related deaths.

He was readmitted on June 5 after his conditions worsened, and a re-test on Tuesday finally confirmed that he had the disease. His case raises the possibility of the MERS being exposed to the general public depending on when he caught the virus.

The former had a history of liver cancer and liver cirrhosis while the latter had been suffering from multiple myeloma.MERS is thought to particularly affect those with preexisting medical conditions. All MERS-related deaths in Korea to date have been patients aged over 55. Of the 13 new infections, 10 were at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, now one of the nation\u2019s two hardest hit medical facilities in the MERS outbreak. As of Wednesday, 29 hospitals were affected by the disease.A medical professional tends to a patient infected with MERS at an isolated ward at Seoul Medical Center on Wednesday. (Yonhap)As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of people quarantined for possible infection rose to 3,439. Another 229 are waiting on their test results, including a pregnant woman who was initially reported to be the nation\u2019s first pregnant MERS patient, but tested negative in the second test.According to authorities, 11 patients are in unstable condition, including a doctor from Samsung Medical Center who requires breathing assistance.Four people have fully recovered from the disease, including a 25-year-old woman who was released from the hospital Wednesday. In a public statement, acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the government has designated medical institutions in each municipality for intensive treatment of MERS. The 16 institutions include Boramae medical center in Seoul, Chungnam National University Hospital in Daejeon and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province.The government also designated 32 separate hospitals to treat suspected MERS patients. Choi advised people to refrain from visiting hospitals, as all infections to date have occurred at hospitals. Health authorities reiterated that the possibility of an epidemic was slim, saying that confirmed patients have not come into contact with the general public. But with many in the public questioning the effectiveness of government measures and the number of cases climbing, the MERS scare showed little signs of slowing down. To date, 1,547 educational institutes in Korea have canceled classes. The Seoul education office extended the cancellation of classes for the MERS-stricken Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu regions and strongly advised schools in Gangdong-gu and Songpa-gu to suspend classes as well.Speculations by the health authorities also turned slightly grimmer Wednesday. The MERS special response team Tuesday had speculated that the outbreak would start to gradually decrease. But in Wednesday\u2019s briefing, it said more cases may emerge for the next two or three days. As part of its effort to rein in MERS, the government turned to more drastic measures. It conducted an inspection on all patients diagnosed with pneumonia in over 3,000 medical institutions across the country, as part of the \u201cpreemptive\u201d measures against MERS.Patients subject to inspection were banned from leaving the hospitals.The wide-scale inspection was in response to calls made by the Korea Society of Infectious Diseases, which suspected that MERS patients being wrongly diagnosed with pneumonia had led to the disease\u2019s rapid spread. As MERS symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia, many patients were initially labeled as pneumonia patients and not quarantined, including the nation\u2019s first MERS patient. This appears to have subsequently led to the large-scale infection within the hospital.A joint team of officials from the government and the World Health Organization were conducting an investigation to determine the reason for the infection\u2019s rapid spread in such a short time. The first patient was diagnosed on May 20. \u201cThe evidence presented thus far suggests that the pattern of the outbreak in the Republic of Korea may be similar to MERS outbreaks that have taken place in health care facilities in the Middle East. However, the situation is rapidly evolving and investigations are ongoing,\u201d the joint team said in its message to the Korean public.Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO, suspected that South Korea\u2019s culture of taking care of family members\u2019 illnesses may have contributed to the rapid spreading of the disease.But the joint team advised authorities to reopen schools, as they are not linked to the transmission of MERS. The government\u2019s concern is now on preventing massive infections from reoccurring after Samsung Medical Center and Pyeongtaek St. Mary\u2019s Hospital each reported 37 cases.\u201cAs of now, all MERS infections occurred via close contact. We are closely monitoring to ensure that we do not lose track of anyone who has had close contact with a MERS patient,\u201d said Kwon Deok-cheol from the MERS special response team. South Korea is second only to Saudi Arabia \u2015 where the illness was first reported in 2012 and which hosts over 90 percent of total confirmed cases \u2015 in the number of MERS cases. As such, other countries have stepped up monitoring tourists from Korea.Hong Kong\u2019s health authorities reported Wednesday that 16 tourists from Korea have been quarantined and tested for MERS since Monday.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","461":"Experts from the World Health Organization and South Korea on Wednesday urged the reopening of more than 2,700 schools closed over fears of the deadly MERS virus.South Korean officials this week said the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak may have peaked but that the next several days would be crucial to determining whether their efforts to isolate infected patients had stymied the disease. President Park Geun-hye's office announced earlier Wednesday that Park had postponed her planned U.S. visit to focus on dealing with the outbreak.The outbreak has killed nine people and infected more than 100 in South Korea, but has occurred only at hospitals. MERS spreads through close contact with sick people, not through the air\u00a0Even so, there have been widespread fears and rumors, and more than 2,700 schools remain closed and about 3,440 people were isolated Wednesday because they have had contact with infected people.``Strong consideration should be given to reopening schools, as schools have not been linked to transmission of'' the MERS virus in South Korea, said a release from the joint WHO-South Korea mission tasked with reviewing the outbreak.Other South Korean doctors have already described the massive school closures as nonsensical because there has been no evidence of the virus' transmission in the community.\u00a0\u00a0 It was not immediately known how many schools would follow the recommendation. But South Korean officials hope the outbreak will come under control around Friday, the last day of the virus' maximum two-week incubation period for those infected by a patient considered as the main source of the second round of the MERS outbreak. Officials say the first wave of the outbreak has ended. But critics say the outbreak will continue if infected people evade government quarantine measures and spread the virus.\u00a0 MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure.The South Korean outbreak originated from a 68-year-old man who had traveled to the Middle East before being diagnosed as the country's first MERS patient last month.

The five face charges of business obstruction and libel.Two of the eight are provincial civil servants who allegedly made public a list of suspected MERS cases without consent.The remaining one is charged with spreading false rumors while posing as a reporter.The police received a total of 44 reports of such cases and will continue to investigate the remaining 36, they said. Most reported victims are hospitals, schools or private education facilities.Rumors were distributed rampantly early after MERS first broke out on May 20, before the government released the list of MERS-affected hospitals on June 7.The government had vowed stern measures against those who spread false rumors thereby worsening public fears over the disease.\u201cEven after the government announcement of the list of (MERS-hit) hospitals, distribution of false information about medical facilities and other privately owned businesses seems to continue,\u201d the police said.The suspects will face criminal charges if their distributed information is found to have defamed or obstructed business, it added.From news reports (khnews@heraldcorp.com)","463":"The number of people being monitored for possible Middle East respiratory syndrome in Gyeonggi Province reduced for the first time this week since its outbreak last month.The province\u2019s MERS countermeasures headquarters said Wednesday that as of 6 p.m. Tuesday, a total of 2,019 were put on watch, down by 84 from 2,103 the day before.The team had been keeping count of suspected MERS patients since June 1.The number had surged from 910 on June 1 to 1,040 the next day, and continued to rise until Monday.\u201cAs time passes, more people with no signs of symptoms are being excluded from the watch list.

A member of staff at a community health center will give you a call,\u201d the text message read. \u201cNearly an hour passed, but my mother\u2019s phone did not ring. I had to phone the hospital to find out the situation,\u201d Yoo, who has been under quarantine at home since Sunday, told The Korea Herald. A day after her mother visited the hospital, the 25-year-old office worker learned that the 76th confirmed MERS patient stayed at the hospital\u2019s emergency room until Saturday morning, the same day Yoo\u2019s mother had surgery for a fracture. A government official from her local ward office finally contacted them Monday, but only asked Yoo\u2019s mother to quarantine herself at home. The official did not ask any further questions, and so failed to find out that Yoo and her father also visited the emergency room to take care of her. Yoo and her father were quarantined only after they reported themselves to the authorities.\u00a0Receptionists at Seoul Asan Hospital in western Seoul wear masks after the hospital saw its first MERS infected patient Tuesday. The patient had been working as a security guard at the emergency center where the sixth patient was admitted on May 26. (Yonhap)As of Tuesday afternoon, some 2,892 people were under quarantine. The government reported the seventh death from MERS and confirmed eight more cases of the disease, pushing the number of confirmed patients to 95. Three confirmed patients were discharged after recovery. \u201cThe government appears unprepared to cope with the MERS outbreak,\u201d Yoo said, pointing to gaps in the authorities\u2019 efforts to trace all contacts of infected people and place them under quarantine. \u201cIt seems like the government totally depends on the medical records provided by hospitals, meaning that it is unrealistic to trace all those possibly exposed to the virus,\u201d she said. Although Yoo understands the government\u2019s difficulty in monitoring everyone under quarantine, she doubts whether it can combat the spread of MERS this way.\u201cThe official assigned to our family checks whether we are at home and have symptoms for MERS by phone twice a day,\u201d Yoo said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t answer our phone, there is no way he can track us.\u201d Despite the government\u2019s stepped-up efforts to contain the deadly virus, concerns are growing that the authorities\u2019 lax management of those quarantined could lead to transmission of the disease outside of hospitals. Local news outlets are reporting increasing numbers of cases in which patients suspected of having MERS are wandering around hospitals for treatment, potentially exposing unspecified crowds to the virus. Four days on since Yoo\u2019s family was placed in isolation, they are still suffering from a lack of food and heaps of rubbish at home. \u201cWhen I asked how we can feed ourselves and deal with the garbage without stepping outside, the government official kept saying \u2018We cannot help it,\u2019\u201d Yoo said, berating the government for not providing enough instructions for those abruptly placed under quarantine. \u201cThey should offer us more than a mask, disinfectants and a simple brochure with measures to prevent MERS,\u201d she said, calling on the government to give more detailed instructions and create a bearable environment for those quarantined. With food running out, Yoo ordered groceries through an online shopping mall to have them delivered in front of her door, preparing for the days to come under quarantine. Given MERS has an incubation period of two to 14 days, the family needs to be in isolation for 10 more days. Meanwhile, some others placed in isolation said that the fast-circulating rumors in the community about their possible infection made them feel even more isolated. \u201cEven after our family is released from quarantine, I am not sure we can continue to live in this neighborhood with such a stigma,\u201d said a doctor, who has been quarantined for nearly two weeks.While Yoo\u2019s family was considered \u201clucky\u201d to be informed by the hospital of their possible infection, many others showing symptoms are having difficulties in receiving medical check-ups to confirm whether they are infected. As part of efforts to prevent the virus from further spreading, the government set up a hotline for those suspected of MERS to report themselves to the authorities. But the lines are always busy, a 31-year-old Seoul citizen said, adding that the parties in charge of protecting citizens appear to be trying to shift responsibility onto each other. \u201cWhen I managed to contact a counsellor, she said that I should go to a hospital first. When I went to a hospital, the doctor said that I should go to a community health clinic,\u201d he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","466":"The joint inter-Korean factory park in the North Korean city of Gaeseong registered accumulated production volume worth $3 billion this year since its opening 11 years ago, the Unification Ministry said Sunday.The volume of manufactured goods accumulated since the opening of the Gaeseong Industrial Complex in 2005 reached $2.996 billion as of the end of July this year, according to the data from the ministry handling inter-Korean affairs.Given that the average monthly production volume hovered around $46 million this year, the total output is certain to have surpassed the $3 billion mark during August, for which official data is not yet available. Launched amid a reconciliatory mood between the rival Koreas, the joint factory park posted $14.9 million in production in its first year of operations in 2005 and its annual output grew to more than $100 million in 2007. The yearly production volume has steadily increased every year to amount to $470 million in 2014, except for 2013 when the two Koreas suspended operations due to inter-Korean tensions.The speedy production growth helped the Kaesong Industrial Complex surpass the $1 billion mark in accumulated output in 2010 and the $2 billion level in 2013.\u00a0 The production volume for the first half of this year stood at $278 million, and if this pace continues, the joint park could post annual production of more than $500 million for all of 2015 for the first time in its 11-year history. Currently, the joint Gaeseong park hosts 124 South Korean companies, a sharp growth from 18 firms in 2005.The number of North Korean workers employed in the complex has also soared from around 6,000 to 54,000 during the same period. Fabric businesses account for 58 percent of the South Korean companies running factories inside the Gaeseong Industrial Complex, while machinery represents 19 percent, followed by electronics and chemical. \"For the future development of the factory park, there should be a complete settlement of wage issues as well as improvement in inter-Korean relations,\" Shin Han-yong, vice chairman of the South Korean management committee for the complex, said.

Pointing out Korea\u2019s hosting of the 2015 OSCE-Asian Conference in Seoul on Monday, Mercuri stressed: \u201cKorea hosting the conference on the theme of the changing global security environment and vision of multilateral security cooperation shows the importance the Korean government attaches to regional peace and prosperity.\u201cPeace and stability in East Asia is paramount to the security in the world, and Italy will continue to contribute in all possible ways to our shared goals,\u201d he added. Italian Ambassador Sergio Mercuri (right) poses next to Korean Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs Shin Dong-ik at his last national day reception at the ambassador\u2019s residence in Seoul on Tuesday. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)Korean Deputy Minister for multilateral and global affairs Shin Dong-ik said in a speech: \u201cAs partners in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe since 1994, we discussed many different issues of international security in the last two days, including terrorism, cyberspace threats and natural disasters.\u201cKorea is the only country that signed three agreements with the EU on political cooperation, free trade and crisis management. We would like to apply lessons learned in Europe to our Northeast Asia Peace and Security Initiative,\u201d Shin added. Italy and Korea established diplomatic relations in 1884, and exchanged state visits last year when President Park Geun-hye visited Rome and Milan in October on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe Meeting and Korea-Italy Business Forum on Creative Economy.Through these venues, the two governments signed new treaties and memorandums on fashion, design, pharmacy and information communication technology, and vowed to expand cooperation between small and medium-sized companies. SMEs in Italy comprise over 70 percent of the country\u2019s companies and 80 percent of gross domestic product. Employing less than 250 employees, the businesses, many of which have been family-run for centuries, make up over 65 percent of Italian exports and 80 percent of jobs. The annual trade volume between Italy and Korea is near $10 billion within the EU-Korea free trade agreement, and the two countries are currently working to eliminate double taxation and promote working holidays. At the 2015 Milan Expo held under the theme \u201cFeeding the planet, energy for life\u201d from May to October, Korea will dedicate a pavilion, which will display a variety of healthy dishes. On June 23, a Korean national day will be celebrated in Milan. Starting June 5, the Alitalia airline will resume a direct flight between Incheon and Rome after more than 20 years\u2019 hiatus, in an effort to boost tourism to Italy during the exposition period and Italian exports to Korea. Three flights per week will run during the summer, and the number will increase to four starting in November. The flight runs in consort with the Sky Team partner Korean Air, which also provides daily service between the two countries.

I think it's very interesting, it's very creative,\" Medeiros said. \"I appreciate the fact that the ROK (South Korea) took the initiative. It's something that we need to discuss in more detail.\"The vision is aimed at promoting peace by building trust in a step-by-step manner. It calls for countries in the region to start with softer, nonpolitical issues, such as environmental issues and disaster relief, to foster trust before expanding cooperation to tackling serious political and security matters.Northeast Asia has long been plagued by historical and territorial rows in addition to military tensions stemming from North Korean provocations, despite deep economic interdependence among the countries in the region. Japan remains at odds with its two key neighbors, South Korea and China, over its militaristic past and territorial claims.Park calls the situation the \"Asia paradox.\"The NAPCI has been one of Park's trademark security policies, along with the Korean Peninsula trust process that calls for similar step-by-step measures to build trust between the two Koreas.Medeiros said there are still questions about the initiative, such as how it is different from the six-party talks and whether it will undercut some of the current structures in the de-facto regional security architecture.\"I think that President Park's visit is the perfect opportunity to discuss some of these issues,\" he said. (Yonhap)","474":"South Korea confirmed nine more cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome on Saturday, bringing the total number of people infected with the disease to 50.Five of them were infected with MERS after visiting Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, where a doctor was recently diagnosed with the illness, according to the health ministry.Another three were patients and medical staff at Saint Mary Hospital in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, where the first MERS case originated weeks ago.The total number of MERS infections has reached 50, with four deaths, since the first outbreak on May 20.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent globally before the outbreak in South Korea, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Most people infected with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness, including a fever, cough and shortness of breath. There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.The health ministry said it agreed with local governments to disclose other MERS-affected hospitals in order to take preemptive measures to tackle the fast-spreading respiratory illness.The South Korean authorities identified Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital on Friday on rising public demand for sharing facilities'names. They had refused to share the names of hospitals for more than two weeks, citing \"unnecessary fear and stigmatization.\"The move came after Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon held a midnight press conference to complain of the authorities' lax disease management and said he would now take charge of efforts to deal with MERS in Seoul.Park disclosed that a Samsung Medical Center doctor who has since been diagnosed with MERS allegedly had direct and indirect contact with over 1,500 people before his infection was confirmed.Meanwhile, the health ministry said that the MERS virus spreading in South Korea has not mutated and showed similar genomic sequences with the contagion discovered in Middle Eastern countries.The fast pace of MERS proliferation in South Korea has raised questions among foreign experts about whether the virus has undergone changes that could make it more infectious.\"The Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) brought in such results after doing a culture test on the MERS virus gathered from a local patient and analyzing its full genomic sequence,\" said the ministry in a press briefing.The KNIH did the joint research with a local virology society, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other foreign institutions to find out whether a gene mutation happened in South Korea.The ministry said the virus from the South Korean patient had a99.55 percent similarity with a virus sample from a Saudi Arabian stored by the U.S. National Institute of Health in 2012.\"South Korea's weather is more favorable for the survival of the MERS virus than in the Middle East,\" said an official from the ministry. \"In terms of virology, the virus here is the same.\" (Yonhap)","475":"South Korea plans to provide North Korea with devices to detect the MERS virus early next week so they could be installed at a joint industrial zone in the North, a Unification Ministry official said Friday.\u00a0 At the request of the North, South Korea plans to lend Pyongyang three thermal scanners for those who move in and out of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, where about 53,000 North Korean workers are employed, the official said, asking not to be named.\"Seoul plans to lend the thermal scanners to the North on Monday,\" said the official.\u00a0 \"South Korean firms operating at the zone will decide whether to provide masks to the North's workers soon.\"Concerns about the spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome are growing in the South as the virus has killed four South Koreans so far, while the number of those infected has increased to 41.The reclusive communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases due to its weak health care system. Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the deadly Ebola virus.This is not the first time that Seoul has provided such devices to Pyongyang at the request of the North.In November, the South lent three thermal scanners to the North when fears of the Ebola virus gripped the world. In 2009, the North made a similar request to the South over concerns of avian flu.A group of 124 South Korean firms operating at the complex plans to hold a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the issue of mask supply.\"It is highly likely that the companies will offer masks to North Korean workers,\" a company official said.

Of course we must support the U.S.,\" wrote one Naver user.

(Yonhap)","478":"South Korea voiced deep regret Thursday that North Korea has chided the South for the failure to hold inter-Korean talks, calling on Pyongyang to end its groundless verbal attacks and insults.The North's committee for the peaceful reunification of Korea issued a statement Wednesday that South Korea will not be able to evade responsibility for having strained bilateral relations due to its hypocrisy as it is seeking to pursue both pressure against the North and dialogue with it.Earlier this week, the North also blamed the South for the failure to organize a joint event to mark the 15th anniversary of a historic inter-Korean summit, saying that Seoul has set unnecessary preconditions for the event.The Ministry of Unification expressed deep regret over the North's move and urged North Korea to accept Seoul's offer for talks without preconditions \"Despite South Korea's repeated proposal for talks, Pyongyang has passed the buck to Seoul for the suspension of dialogue,\" said a ministry official, asking not to be named. \"We express our deep regret over the North's criticism.\"The official called on the North to come to the talks without any preconditions for peace and stability on a divided peninsula.The North has raised the level of its provocation in recent weeks as it claimed it had successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile. It also said that it has already miniaturized nuclear warheads enough to be placed on missiles.Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have recently vowed to increase pressure against the North to make it abandon its nuclear weapons.Despite lingering tension, Seoul has said that it will continue to encourage civilians to expand inter-Korean exchanges if they help promote reconciliation and restore national unity. (Yonhap)","479":"At the end of the Korean War in 1953, Korea was a country in ruins with a per capita income of $70, worse off than some of Africa\u2019s poorest nations. Over the next several decades, using foreign aid, Korea elevated its economy to the world\u2019s 14th largest, pushing the frontiers of market and technology. The miraculous transformation of a once-ravaged country was aided in large part by the World Bank, which provided over $15 billion in development assistance to build Korea\u2019s railways, rural towns and schools. The World Bank Group Korea Office and Korea\u2019s Ministry of Strategy and Finance organized the conference, \u201cKorea Week 2015 \u2015 Retrospect and Prospect,\u201d at the Sheraton Incheon Hotel in Songdo from Monday to Tuesday, celebrating the last 60 years of productive partnership.\u00a0 Axel van Trotsenburg. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)The WBG is a family of five organizations \u2015 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes \u2015 that provide leveraged loans to developing countries to reduce poverty and create wealth. Korea joined the IBRD in 1955, the IDA in 1961 and the IFC in 1964. It exited these programs by 1995, only to rejoin following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. \u201cIn Korean culture, 60 years represents a life cycle and Koreans say that life truly starts at 60. I hope this year will mark the beginning of our new lifelong partnership,\u201d Axel van Trotsenburg, the WBG vice president of East Asia and the Pacific, told The Korea Herald on Monday. \u201cAlthough the form of our relationship has evolved over the years, its depth and importance remain the same. Our solidarity strengthens our institutions and motivates other countries that are still struggling.\u201d In an effort to deepen engagement with Korea, the World Bank opened a Korea Office in Songdo, Incheon in December 2013. Korea became the first country to become a donor after having been a recipient by joining the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee in 2010. Since then, it has more than doubled its ODA contributions to $1.85 billion last year, offering replenishments to countries in Africa and South and Southeast Asia. In the early days, the World Bank provided financial support, policy advice and technical assistance to Korea. Between 1962 and 2001, Korea received over $15 billion for 133 projects in rural development, transport, education and environment. The World Bank provided $65 million to build roads and housing in Gwangju in 1980, which contributed to Korea\u2019s balanced development. It provided $100 million for vocational training of workers between 1980 and 1986. Nowadays, some 50 Korean institutions and companies are providing technical assistance to developing countries in the areas of finance, information communications technology, electronic learning and urban and sustainable development. The key to a successful partnership, according to Trotsenburg, is long-term engagement capable of meeting the evolving challenges of the globe. \u201cKorea beat the perception of a poor country by lifting its meager income at the end of the war to a $25,000 mark,\u201d Trotsenburg said. \u201cThis has been nothing short of impressive. We can help lift people out of poverty globally as Korea has done itself.\u201dThe factors that have led to Korea\u2019s economic rise are the sound regulatory framework and macroeconomic policies, an export-oriented strategy, high savings and investment, development of human capital, risk-taking and entrepreneurship, Trotsenburg pointed out. The land reforms in the 1950s and 1960s distributed income equitably across cities and the countryside. A series of seven five-year development plans from 1961 have harnessed competitive industries, enabling a progression from light to heavy and high-tech industries. \u201cThe combination of strategic policies and hard work allowed Korea to overcome its challenges,\u201d he argued, adding that Korean people have managed to preserve their culture and identity against a tide of modernization.Trotsenburg said that the World Bank supported multilateralism essential for the international financial architecture. \u201cWe need to have the best possible cooperation and coordination, because taxpayers\u2019 money is involved and people want results,\u201d he stressed. In the spirit of multilateralism, he said the World Bank welcomed the ascendency of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which Korea announced in March its intention to join, as it will allow both institutions to collectively reduce infrastructure deficits in Asia, he highlighted. \u201cThe World Bank shares information on best practice, operation and governance with the AIIB, as it has done with other multilateral institutions in the past.\u201dThe global infrastructure deficit currently exceeds $1 trillion, of which $800 billion is in Asia. The World Bank provides $10 billion a year of infrastructure financing to Asian countries.The World Bank works together with the United Nations, Asian Development Bank and national governments. As the United Nations works to enforce its sustainable and millennium development goals this year, the World Bank will join the global coalition against climate change, Trotsenburg emphasized. Korea\u2019s future challenges lie in managing its natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions and making a transition to a green economy, Trotsenburg underscored. The aging population and volatile global economy can be other retarding factors on growth. The good news for Korea, according to the vice president, is that it belongs to the world\u2019s most economically dynamic region of East Asia, which creates more than half of global growth. \u201cKorea has been exemplary in conquering overseas markets with its export-oriented strategy and continuous innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cContinuing the path of success will open new blue oceans for Korea.\u201dBy Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","480":"South Korea urged North Korea Wednesday not to blame Seoul for the failure to organize a joint event to mark the 15th anniversary of a historic inter-Korean summit.A preparatory group in South Korea said Tuesday that the North had proposed to separately hold a summit anniversary event in mid-June, in what could be another setback to the already strained Seoul-Pyongyang ties. The North rebuked the South for setting unnecessary preconditions for the event.The Ministry of Unification voiced regret over the North's move, calling on Pyongyang not to blame Seoul for the thwarted attempt to jointly celebrate the event.\"It is very inappropriate that the North has passed the buck to the South over the failed move to organize it,\" ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing.Lim said that Seoul will continue to encourage civilians to expand inter-Korean exchanges if they help promote reconciliation and restore national unity.The North's decision may also dampen prospects for holding a joint event that marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule on Korea's Liberation Day that falls on Aug. 15, experts said.Touching on the reported severe drought in North Korea, Lim said that Seoul plans to grasp the situation in detail before deciding whether to provide humanitarian assistance.The United Nations has warned that North Korea is likely to suffer from serious food shortages this year due to drought.

It also released a list of 14 government decrees that it claimed were inconsistent with upper laws, pledging to take issue with them in a blunt rebuttal against President Park Geun-hye\u2019s threat to veto the new parliamentary powers the day before.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy asserted that the legislature has the \u201clegitimate\u201d authority to demand changes to the executive\u2019s enforcement decrees, refuting Park\u2019s argument that the bill would \u201cparalyze\u201d the government\u2019s activity. The move was expected to escalate the tension between the National Assembly and Cheong Wa Dae in the lead-up to upcoming parliamentary session. Park said Monday that she would reject the bill unless the assembly revised the bill. The rival parties passed the bill last Friday after reaching a bipartisan agreement.\u00a0 Members of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy including chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (front, right) attend a party lawmakers workshop in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t need to make a fuss out of (the bill),\u201d said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul on Tuesday. \u201cThe National Assembly has the mechanism to verify whether the bill is right or wrong. I urge the president to trust the Assembly, so that it can do its job,\u201d he added.On Monday, the NPAD said that it would seek changes to a total of 14 government decrees that they said undermined the legislature\u2019s efforts by falling short of serving their intended purposes. Among them are decrees for the special Sewol law, child care subsidies and compensation for victims of the Gwangju democratic movement. The NPAD has claimed the government used the decree to bypass the law. \u201cThose are examples of the government violation of upper laws,\u201d said NPAD Rep. Kang Gi-jung on Monday. \u201cIf the president vetoes (the revised assembly law), it would violate democracy and reflect her views that the executive branch is beyond the Constitution,\u201d said Kang.The ruling Saenuri Party, for its part, downplayed the forcibleness of the revised parliamentary rule, saying the government does not have an obligation to abide by the Assembly\u2019s demand. The party pointed out the law lacks specific clauses to force the government to accept the amendments suggested by the lawmakers. \u201c(The NPAD)\u2019s rationale is a bit exaggerated,\u201d said Rep. Chang Yoon-seok of Saenuri Party. \u201cIt is a critical issue as to whether a branch can force other branches to do something and, thus, the law should spell it out in specifics. Obviously, the law does not spell it out, so the NPAD is interpreting the law in its favor,\u201d said Chang.The revision to the Assembly Law\u2019s Clause 2 of Article 98 stipulates that the parliament can demand a revision or change to an enforcement ordinance and the head of the relevant ministry must \u201chandle\u201d the demand and report back with the result. Previously it had stated that in cases where an ordinance is deemed to conflict with a higher law, the parliament could notify the head of the relevant ministry.Meanwhile, the NPAD on Tuesday held a workshop to review the causes of their crushing defeat in the April by-election and discuss action plans for this month\u2019s parliamentary session. \u201cWe attained our goals at the last parliamentary session,\u201d said NPAD Chairman Rep.

Among the six new confirmed patients, four are believed to have been infected by the first patient from May 15-17, at the same medical facility where 15 individuals were previously infected by the 68-year-old. The remaining two are believed to have been infected by the 16th confirmed patient at a different clinic from May 28 to 30.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","489":"Elder statesmen and business leaders from Japan on Monday urged South Korean President Park Geun-hye to hold a summit with her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, to help improve the bilateral relationship beset by historical and territorial feuds.During their meeting with Park at Cheong Wa Dae, the six-member Japanese delegation of the South Korea-Japan \u201cWise Man Group\u201d stressed joint efforts to address historical animosities on the occasion of the 50th anniversary this year of the normalization of their diplomatic ties.\u201cPark did not directly mention the summit. But we felt she made comments to the effect that Seoul would try to hold a summit at an early date, as she understands the wishes of the Wise Man Group,\u201d former chief cabinet secretary Takeo Kawamura, a member of the Japanese delegation, told the press conference after the meeting with Park. President Park Geun-hye greets a group of Japanese opinion leaders and senior statesmen including former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori (left) at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. (Yonhap.)Since Park was inaugurated in February 2013 she has refused to hold a bilateral summit with Abe, saying that the summit would not yield any fruitful result while the anti-Japanese sentiment continued to worsen. Kawamura also expressed hopes that Abe would take advantage of his much-anticipated statement in August \u2015 which would mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II \u2015 to improve the strained ties with Seoul.He added that during the talks with Park, she said she wanted to try to help the victims of Japan\u2019s wartime sexual slavery \u201cregain their honor.\u201d Tokyo has refused to accept the legal responsibility of the atrocities, arguing a lack of clear evidence that Japan as a state forcibly mobilized Korean women for sexual slavery at frontline brothels.Former South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan, a member of the South Korean side of the group, said that during the talks with Park, the group urged the leaders of the two countries to make a \u201cbig decision\u201d to move the bilateral relationship forward.During the group\u2019s luncheon meeting with Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, the top diplomat expressed Seoul\u2019s concerns over Japan\u2019s bid to list 23 major wartime industrial facilities as World Heritage sites. Seoul has demanded that seven of the 23 facilities, those where Koreans were forced to labor during the colonial era, should be removed from the bidding process, or that the historical facts about forced labor should be clearly explained when the seven facilities are presented. Earlier in the day, former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of the Japanese delegation stressed the importance of bilateral cooperation to cope with the changing security landscape in the region \u2015 beset by Pyongyang\u2019s pursuit of nuclear arms and Beijing\u2019s increasing assertiveness.\u201cIt is very important for South Korea and Japan \u2015 two countries that are small yet very powerful \u2015 to cooperate and respond to the world\u2019s trends amid a shift in international security conditions,\u201d he said during the session in a Seoul hotel.Saying that there have already been many exchanges among the new generations of the two countries, he pointed out that politicians\u2019 \u201cstubbornness\u201d has hindered the joint efforts to improve bilateral relations.Launched to explore ways to improve the bilateral ties, the Wise Man Group held its first session in March in Tokyo.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","490":"South Korea and China officially signed their bilateral free trade agreement Monday, taking a step closer to implementing what officials here call a mutually beneficial and significant trade pact.The agreement was signed by South Korean Trade Minister Yoon Sang-jick and his Chinese counterpart Gao Hucheng in Seoul, about six months after the two countries declared the conclusion of their negotiations that began in May 2012. The bilateral trade pact was initialed in Beijing on Feb. 25.The countries now only need approval from their respective legislatures before implementing the deal, which they plan to do before the end of the year, according to trade officials here.\"The Korea-China FTA will not only help expand the countries' bilateral trade and investment, but also become a platform for mutual cooperation through which the countries' governments and businesses will seek new and joint growth engines,\" the trade ministers said, according to Seoul's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.The FTA will be one of the largest and most significant free trade deals signed by South Korea as China is already, by far, the world's single largest importer of South Korean goods, accounting for more than one-fourth of South Korea's overall exports in 2014.Immediately following its implementation, the Korea-China FTA will help expand South Korea's trade territory, represented by the combined gross domestic product of countries with which South Korea has an FTA, from the current 61 percent to 73 percent of global GDP.It is also expected to help boost the countries' annual bilateral trade to more than $300 billion, a 39.5 percent hike from $215.1 billion in 2012, Seoul's trade ministry said.In the 10 years following its implementation, the free trade deal is expected to boost South Korea's real GDP by 0.96 percent while creating some 53,800 new jobs.For China, too, the FTA will be significant and meaningful.A ministry official noted the Korea-China FTA will equally help expand China's economy and trade.However, benefits of the free trade pact will be more political than economic, said the official while speaking on condition of anonymity.The Korea-China FTA comes as Beijing is moving to create an economic bloc in Northeast Asia, apparently as part of efforts to strengthen its leadership while also countering the U.S. presence in the region.\"Through the Korea-China FTA, China may have sought to embrace South Korea while competing for economic and political leadership in Northeast Asia,\" the official said.China is currently seeking to sign a three-way FTA with South Korea and Japan while also pushing for a regional FTA, known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, that again involves South Korea and Japan, along with 13 other countries, including Australia, India and New Zealand.In a letter to South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Chinese President Xi Jinping noted the agreement will greatly contribute to economic integration in East Asia.\"Signing an FTA between South Korea and China, major economic players in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, is a monumental event. This will not only lead to a new leap in trade relations between the two countries but also bring practical benefits to the people of both countries,\" Xi said in his letter released by Seoul's trade ministry.Park agreed the bilateral FTA will mutually benefit both countries.\"The Korea-China FTA will bring a wide range of opportunities and benefits to the people and businesses of both countries, and become a historical milestone in the countries' efforts to deepen their strategic cooperative partnership,\" she said in her reply to her Chinese counterpart.Trade officials here also said the Korea-China FTA is the first of its kind ever signed by Beijing that has separate chapters on electronic trade, finance and communications.\"To China, this means it has accepted and opened its market to international norms, which means it can be on the offensive side while negotiating for future FTAs with other countries,\" the official said.Under the Korea-China FTA, Seoul will eliminate its import tariffs on 79 percent of all products, or 9,690 goods, from China within 10 years following its implementation.Beijing will do the same on 71 percent of all products, or 5,846 items, from South Korea over the cited period.In the 20 years after the FTA goes into effect, South Korea will have eliminated its tariffs on 92 percent of all products from China with China eliminating its tariffs on 91 percent of all products from South Korea.

Realistically, however, there could be different views on the specific ways and level of pressure, he said on background.It represents a dilemma for South Korea, which is seeking to get tougher on its increasingly hostile communist neighbor.The South's top nuclear envoy, Hwang Joon-kook, held trilateral discussions with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts, Sung Kim and Junichi Ihara, in Seoul last week. Hwang and Kim then visited Beijing for separate talks with China's top diplomat on Korea, Wu Dawei.The series of diplomatic meetings came in response to Pyongyang's claims of launching a ballistic missile from a submarine and mastering a technology to mount nuclear bombs onto missiles.In Tokyo, senior officials from South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China and Russia met for a regional security forum. All the countries are members of the now-suspended six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons program.\"The five parties have agreed on the need for pressure on North Korea. For now, there is no option other than pressure,\" the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. \"But there could be differences on what and how to do.\"Besides U.N.-led sanctions, the human rights issue can be a card to ratchet up pressure on the North, but China and Russia remain opposed to that, he pointed out.\"Economic cooperation can also serve as a tool for pressure,\" the official said, but he stopped short of elaborating.What is important is to \"change the thought and calculation\" of the North's leaders and persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table, he added.Pyongyang has not budged at all, passing the responsibility for lack of dialogue to Washington.In a statement issued Sunday, the North's foreign ministry said it's too late for any talks, saying the country will continue its efforts toward a \"balance of forces\" with the U.S. through the development of nuclear weapons.Another South Korean government official said, \"It seems like North Korea publicly used the expression 'balance of forces.'\"It apparently shows that Pyongyang has no will for talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear weapons program.

More than 20 USFK research personnel were exposed to it, but they were not infected, USFK officials said, adding they were not aware that the sample contained live bacteria.The group also called on the U.S. and South Korea to improve what it calls the \u201cunreasonable\u201d status of forces agreement that governs the stationing of U.S. forces in Korea. It argued that the SOFA should make it necessary for Washington to consult with Seoul on shipments of dangerous biological and chemical materials.Media reports surfaced Friday alleging that the USFK has run a laboratory using anthrax since 1998, amid growing public criticism of its alleged failure to consult with Seoul over its handling of the lethal pathogen.The USFK said that it was in the process of verifying when the lab was established.The U.S. was reported to have installed its first lab at a USFK installation, mindful of North Korea\u2019s longtime pursuit of chemical and biological weapons, before building labs in overseas locations. The North began research biological weapons in the early 1960s. It is thought to be capable of producing massive amounts of anthrax bacteria \u2015 a reason why the USFK has given its troops vaccinations against anthrax since 1998.The South Korean military currently stocks antibiotics against anthrax, and plans to develop an anthrax vaccine by 2016.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","495":"North Korea is adding more facilities to its recently expanded rocket launch site on the country's west coast, the website 38 North said Thursday, casting doubt over speculation Pyongyang may launch a long-range rocket in October.The North completed the upgrading of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station last year to make it accommodate larger rockets with heavier payloads. The site is where the North successfully fired a long-range rocket and put a satellite into orbit in late 2012.Though the upgrading of the gantry to support a larger rocket was completed, Pyongyang has been further modifying the launch area to include a new support building at the east end of the pad and a platform that appears to move along rails from that building to the launch tower, 38 North said, citing recent satellite imagery.\"While the exact purpose of this building remains unclear, one possibility is that the North Koreans are building a complex similar to facilities observed in China, such as at the Jiuquan Launch Center, that include buildings where the launch vehicle is assembled, processed, and checked, then placed on a movable platform and rolled to the launch tower,\" it said.The construction raises questions about recent media speculation that the North could launch a long-range rocket on the 70th anniversary of Korean Workers Party in October, the website said.\"It would appear difficult although not impossible for the construction to be completed in time to prepare for such a launch.However, ongoing work should not preclude an October launch if North Korea were to interrupt construction and conduct those preparations using existing missile assembly and other facilities,\" it said.The upgrade project is another indicator the North is determined to pursue its space program and points to the fielding of a future space launch vehicle larger than the current one, 38 North said. \"A new larger SLV may further contribute to the North's development of long-range ballistic missiles and provide another sign of Pyongyang's serious commitment to its space program,\" it said.The North's missile program has long been a key security concern in the region and beyond. The communist nation is believed to have developed advanced ballistic missile technologies through a series of test launches, including the most recent and successful launch in 2012.That test sparked fears that the North has moved closer to ultimately developing nuclear-tipped missiles that could potentially reach the mainland United States. The country has so far conducted three underground nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

(Yonhap)","498":"The Constitutional Court on Thursday ruled that a labor law banning dismissed education workers from joining trade unions was constitutional, effectively nailing the coffin shut for a left-leaning teachers\u2019 union fighting to retain its legal status.The Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union has been engaged in a grueling battle with the government over its legal status since October 2013, when the Labor Ministry decided to outlaw the group for violating a labor law clause that bans dismissed education workers from joining the sector\u2019s trade unions.South Korean law stipulates that all education workers should remain politically neutral, and the main purpose of the clause is to ensure that a teachers\u2019 union remains independent from outside influence by excluding noneducation workers.\u00a0 Members of groups opposing and welcoming the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision hold rallies in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)After the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of the government in June 2014, the KTU sought a comeback by attacking the clause itself. The attempt, however, was to no avail as the court shot down its challenge.\u201cA teachers\u2019 union exercises great influence on the working conditions of education workers. Excluding those who are not directly related to such working conditions cannot be seen as an excessive restriction (on the union),\u201d the court said in its ruling. Furthermore, there aren\u2019t any plausible benefits that can be gained from allowing dismissed teachers to become members.\u201dWhile the KTU has already appealed the administrative court\u2019s ruling \u2015 and is likely to take the case to the Supreme Court if the high court also strikes it down \u2015 Thursday\u2019s ruling has virtually settled the case, as the contentious clause was the basis on which the government stripped the group of its legal status. Had the clause been ruled unconstitutional, the grounds upon which the administrative court made its ruling would have been removed. The ruling would likely have been overturned on appeal. If the decision is finalized, the KTU will lose its legal status for the first time since gaining formal status in 1999, 10 years after its foundation. It will subsequently lose all government subsidies while also being relinquished of the right to engage in collective bargaining with the government. All full-time union members of the KTU will also have to return to their teaching posts.The KTU denounced the decision, saying the Constitutional Court has \u201cturned its back on time\u201d by denying the rights of dismissed teachers to join a union. \u201cThe court has been accused of causing a regression of democracy. It is regretful that today\u2019s ruling has done nothing to disprove that opinion,\u201d said KTU leader Byeon Seong-ho. \u201cOutlawing a trade union of 60,000 members just because it has nine dismissed workers is unheard of. Nevertheless, we will keep working to acquire our legal status as soon as possible.\u201dThe group will release a statement about its specific future plans including legal actions on Monday.The conservative Park Geun-hye government has rarely seen eye-to-eye with the left-leaning KTU, one of the most outspoken opponents of its education policies. The rift between the Education Ministry and the KTU was well demonstrated during last week\u2019s World Education Forum 2015 in Incheon, when the group was not invited to participate despite being one of two biggest teachers unions in the country. The KTU responded by holding a press conference outside the venue, criticizing the ministry for \u201cbeing hell-bent on self-praise while turning away from the actual education issues.\u201dThe teachers\u2019 group has urged the judicial authorities as well as the government to \u201crespect the international standards\u201d that they said were to allow dismissed workers from joining trade unions. \u201cThere is no democratic nation that forbids dismissed workers from becoming members of a trade union. As a member of the International Labor Organization, Korea should abide by the agreement on the freedom of association and the protection of the right to collective organization,\u201d the group said in a press conference Wednesday.Attempts to outlaw the KTU have sparked negative reactions from outside the country as well. International Trade Union Confederation and Education International on Thursday requested a permanent injunction of the Labor Ministry\u2019s decision to delegalize the KTU. They said each trade union had a \u201clong-recognized right to decide who may be members and eligible for leadership,\u201d and that each union\u2019s membership rules could reflect those decisions. \u201cThe ILO has clearly stated that the prohibition on dismissed and unemployed workers as members or leaders is a violation of the principles of freedom of association, not merely in the abstract but specifically with regard to Korea. We therefore urge the court to permanently enjoin the Ministry of Employment and Labor as its decision is contrary to international standards,\u201d it said. During the WEF 2015, Education International chief Susan Hopgood urged the government to revise its law to allow dismissed teachers to join unions. \u201cWe think that government should recognize the KTU, stop its action to delegalize the organization and should respect the rights of teaching unions,\u201d she said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","499":"North Korea on Wednesday unveiled video footage that includes the scene of what it claimed to be a successful test-firing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.North Korea's propaganda website Uriminzokkiri made public the two minutes of footage where a projectile that appears to be a ballistic missile was launched from a black submerged vessel. The object flies into the sky with a loud blast after being ejected from underwater in what looks like a test-firing of a ballistic missile.The footage contains a caption that states North Korea's successful launch of an SLBM will nullify the Seoul-Washington alliance and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The North also claimed that Seoul will be engulfed with chaos with just one or two SLBMs.It is not confirmed whether the North's footage is authentic or not.The first 10 seconds of the clip appears to be an edited version of a YouTube video that features the launch of a U.S.ballistic missile, the Trident I.The transition into the latter half, which shows the airborne missile, also appears abrupt, suggesting the second half may have been taken from a different video.The news came as North Korea said last week that it has already made nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles.Experts have raised concerns over Pyongyang's move, since it is seen as part of efforts to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs.South Korea has said the North's test-firing was more of a test for an ejection rather than a firing, since the missile is assumed to have only made it about 100 meters after coming out of the water.But some analysts said if the North's claim is confirmed, the move will add a fresh threat to security on the Korean Peninsula as it is hard to detect where the SLBMs will be launched.

According to a survey conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, couples splitting up after living together for over two decades accounted for 32 percent of the total divorce cases last year, about 10 percentage points higher than that of newlywed couples with less than four years of marriage.Last year, 19,500 couples divorced, while about 65,000 couples tied the knot, the survey said.The change in the perception toward marriage, coupled with improved economic environment and increased life expectancy, contributed to the growing divorce rate among the elderly, the city speculated.The average age of divorcees was 47.8 for men and 44.8 for women. The average age was 10 years younger than two decades ago, city officials said.Meanwhile, the average age of men getting married was 32.8 and women 30.7, about two years older than 10 years ago, they added.About 40 percent of the brides were aged 30 and over, followed by 37 percent in their 20s, they said. The public perception toward marriage has also changed, another survey showed. About 41 percent of the respondents replied that marriage is a choice, showing a 7 percent on-year jump. The number of those who considered marriage as an obligation also dropped by 6 percentage points to 13.4 percent. The rest said it is better to get married if possible. The survey was conducted on 37,000 Koreans across the country, including 4,400 Seoul City residents. By gender, men were more conservative toward marriage. About 45 percent of men responded that it is better to get married while the same number of women said marriage was a matter of choice. Meanwhile, disapproval toward divorce decreased by 3 percentage points to 41.7 percent. Around 12 percent said they were okay with divorce if there was a substantial reason.By Lee Hyun-jeong\u00a0 (rene@heraldcorp.com)","501":"Han Eun-suk, a 53-year-old housewife in southern Seoul, is meticulous in selecting her cooking ingredients, especially water. She never drinks tap water, citing an unpleasant chemical smell and safety concerns. Worried about her family\u2019s health, she has installed a water purifier at home instead. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird smell in tap water. How can you trust tap water that comes through old underground pipes? It\u2019s always better to be safer,\u201d Han said. Han is part of the majority of Koreans who are reluctant to drink tap water, and prefer to use a water purifier or purchase bottled water at home.According to a survey conducted by the Environment Ministry on 12,000 individuals in 2013, only about 10 percent responded that they drank water directly from the tap, whether it is boiled or not. About 55 percent said they drank tap water only after boiling to ensure safety.\u00a0Elementary school studentsdrink tap water at their school in Seoul. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)More than 30 percent of those surveyed responded that they distrust the quality of tap water because of concerns over old water pipes and water tanks. About 28 percent of respondents said they were worried about sanitation at reservoirs. But only about 55 percent answered that they were willing to drink tap water if all such concerns were resolved.Despite emphasis from experts who stress that Korea\u2019s tap water quality is among the best in the world, public distrust over the quality of tap water has been prevalent for quite some time.According to a United Nations\u2019 report in 2003, Korea\u2019s water quality ranked eighth in the world, with its high-tech water treatment facilities and management. Finland topped the chart, followed by Canada and New Zealand. The U.S. took the 12th spot, the report said. To ensure water safety, the Korean government monitors tap water quality around the clock against a minimum of 59 criteria, including checks on residual chlorine levels, pH and various types of bacteria. Along with the mandated monitoring criteria, municipal governments impose their own higher water standards at their own discretion, with over 150 criteria. For example, Seoul City monitors 163 variables while Busan looks at 260, officials said.\u00a0 Children drink tap water in this stock photo provided by Seoul Metropolitan Government.This is not only above the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended level but also more detailed than other countries, they said.In the U.S. and Japan, the number of water quality criteria monitored is around 111. The tap water drinking rate, however, is much higher than in Seoul. As of 2013, 82 percent of Americans and 78 percent of Japanese replied that they drank tap water. In New York, about 80 percent of residents drink tap water despite concerns about old water pipes (most of which are more than 100 years old) and chlorine use, the officials explained.For instance, more than 4 milligrams per liter of chlorine is added to water in New York for germ prevention, while Seoul keeps the minimum amount at 0.2 milligrams per liter. But this, which often leads to stronger chemical smell, seemingly does not deter New Yorkers from drinking water from the tap. Americans have acknowledged that a small amount of chlorine does not pose health issues and is an essential substance for disinfection, thanks to the government\u2019s efforts to raise public awareness of this, the officials explained.Despite the authorities\u2019 efforts to maintain the high quality of tap water, the public has preferred to drink water filtered through water purifiers or purchase bottled water. Some critics pointed out that such public distrust was triggered by the infamous phenol leak accident that prompted water scare across the country in the early 1990s.In 1991, an undiluted solution of phenol was leaked twice from an electronic component factory in Daegu into the Nakdonggang River. The accident caused extreme odors in the region\u2019s tap water, and serious headaches and vomiting among residents who drank it. \u201cOnce a water accident happens in one region just like the phenol leak, it causes nationwide fear as water circulates the country, no matter how well the government responded to the accident. People who raise children especially react sensitively to water accidents,\u201d said Chung Deuk-mo, the director general of Waterworks Research Institute, an affiliated organization of Seoul Metropolitan Government. Along with the phenol leak, aged underground pipes added to the water distrust following several reported cases of red water, experts said. As part of the efforts to guarantee pipe sanitation, the government has worked on replacing water pipes with new, rust-proof ones. \u201cThose pipes aged over two decades are recommended to be replaced. Water flows through pipes upon pressure. Because massive pressure hits the pipes every day, the pipe connections can be twisted, chipped off or even rust,\u201d an official from the Environment Ministry told The Korea Herald, wishing not to be identified.About 180,000 kilometers of water pipes are installed underground across the country, with 70 percent having been laid, replaced or improved in the last 20 years. About 30 percent are awaiting replacement, with most of them in private housing. Replacing the pipes at private housing is at each homeowner\u2019s discretion, officials said. As pipe replacement for an individual home costs around 2 million won ($1,800), many residents have been reluctant to take the responsibility, citing cost burden. To encourage people to replace their pipes, city governments have offered subsidies for those wishing to replace them. In the case of Seoul, the city expanded the subsidy from 50 percent to 80 percent of the cost in an aim to complete the replacement by 2020, officials said. The capital has also completed more than 96 percent of the public water pipe replacement, due to be finished by 2018, with about 470 kilometers remaining, they added.While various factors have led to public distrust, one of the prevalent reasons that Koreans avoid drinking tap water is their sensitivity toward the unpleasant taste that derives from chlorine, experts said. \u201cMany people tend to feel the unpleasant smell and taste from tap water because of chlorine. But chlorine is essential to ensuring water safety as it prevents bacteria propagation,\u201d said water expert Lee Yoon-jin at Konyang University in South Chungcheong Province.In order to have better tasting drinking water while avoiding safety concerns, many Koreans have installed water purifiers at home, thinking that smell-free water is likely safer. The scale of the water purifier market is around 1.5 trillion won a year, Seoul officials said. Experts, however, underscore that purified water is actually not safer than the tap water. \u201cWater filtered through purifiers may seem safer but it can actually lower the water quality unless the filters are regularly replaced. The interior cleaning of purifiers is systematically not easy, and the purifier\u2019s faucet can increase bacteria propagation as it is exposed to the air,\u201d said environment engineering professor Choi Suing-il at Korea University in Seoul. In 2013, more than half of 100 water purifiers in Seoul were found to have had substandard drinking water, the capital\u2019s random inspection report showed. A few were reported to have had about 110 times more germs than average, with one even having colon bacillus, the city said. \u201cAll water purifiers contain activated carbon to remove chlorine, which is the source of the chemical smell that many dislike. As the germ-fighter substance is eliminated, the water is naturally exposed to various bacteria and germs,\u201d Choi added. The more serious problem of water purifiers is that some types of water purifiers even eliminate all the important nutrients contained in tap water, experts said. \u201cBecause tap water is sourced from rivers, such as the Hangang River, it contains various minerals such as calcium and magnesium, with around 20 to 30 milligrams per liter,\u201d a Seoul City official said.Some express health concerns over the chlorine use but experts highlight that a small amount is harmless.\u201cChlorine is a chemical, therefore it can be harmful to health if one is over-exposed. One study showed that it can be detrimental if people are constantly exposed to chlorine over 3,000 ppm over a long period. But unless more than 1,000 milligrams per liter or 1,000 ppm is added to the water, there\u2019s no need to worry,\u201d said Kim Dong-keun, the general director of Citizens Network for Tap Water, adding that bacteria contamination of water due to a lack of chlorine could be more harmful.The government, meanwhile, continues to put efforts into promoting the safety of tap water.Seoul City, for instance, announced last month it would provide free-of-charge quality tests for tap water at some 300,000 homes and improve their water supply facilities. It has also signed up for an insurance to compensate citizens who suffer damage from any water pollution.The city has been providing bottled tap water since 2001, branding the products under the name Arisu in 2004 to rehabilitate its image.In March this year, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon joined a network of some 72 government organizations and civic organizations to only use tap water by installing Arisu drinking fountains at all of its office buildings.Civic groups stress that achieving the cleanliness of tap water and enjoying it is a basic right of the public. \u201cImproving the tap water credibility and expanding the culture of drinking tap water is crucial. Having safe water is not only a basic public right but also part of welfare. People should realize the importance of the cheapest, yet the most vital, benefit to their daily lives,\u201d said Kim.

These include the on-going debate over teachers making political statements or high stress and academic pressure suffered by students due to heated competition.\u201cThere have been talks about students committing suicide because of the education situation. Stress (is) put on them by the government, teachers, parents and the system; but it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re not going to talk about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that there hasn\u2019t been some recognition that there are some things that should change.\u201dSusan Hopgood. (Education International)The international education forum was criticized despite the fanfare, as Korea\u2019s education authorities arranged a lengthy special session on how education has contributed to its rapid economic growth. It invested most of its energy on boasting the accomplishment by Korean students, namely its high performance in Program for International Student Assessment.Hopgood, however, said the education should be more than PISA scores.\u201cPISA only shows some of the (academic) accomplishments. It\u2019s important because it gives international comparisons, but there also needs to be introspection within the system,\u201d she said, adding Korea should ask itself how it can meet the needs of students and teachers in various aspects.These include the immense stress put on students by high expectations on academic performance. The suicide rate for teenagers has increased by 57 percent from 2001 to 2011, a recent report by the Korea Health Promotion Foundation showed.The pressure rises particularly around November during the the national college entrance exam \u2015 called Suneung here. The grade each student gets in the exam plays a critical role in his or her college admission, and reports of students taking their own lives around the day of Suneung emerge each year. \u201cWe hope there is a recognition that the competitive nature of your education system needs to change. And the high-stakes are what causes unhappiness of students,\u201d she said. She spoke out for teachers\u2019 rights in Korea. Under Korean law, teachers and other civil servants are prohibited from publicly expressing their political views.This, Hopgood pointed out, violates their right to freedom of expression. \u201cTeachers should have the same civil rights as all other members of the society. ILO (International Labor Organization) and UNESCO\u2019s recommendation on the state of teachers \u2015 which was adopted by the Korean government \u2015 makes it clear that teachers should have rights, including the right to make political statements,\u201d she said.Hopgood reiterated the EI\u2019s position that the government should abandon its attempt to delegalize the left-leaning Korea Teachers and Education Workers\u2019 Union, which has received criticism for being too political. Speaking from her experience as a teacher in Australia, Hopgood said Korean educators should encourage dialogue on social issues, including politics. This is essential to ensure that the education is not just confined to the textbooks, but also addresses real-life issues. \u201cThe achievement of quality education for all cannot happen until you have proper social dialogue and inclusion of the teaching community,\u201d she said.Education International is a federation of 401 associations and unions across the world, representing some 30 million teachers and education workers in 171 countries and territories.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","503":"Rational people of Germany and Korea must step up collaboration to solve irrational challenges facing the globe, former German President Horst Kohler said last week at an alumni gathering of Germans and Koreans.

Founded in 2008, it holds knowledge seminars, youth gatherings, and culture events year-round for its active 5,000 members, as an umbrella organization of some 50 alumni groups.The world, according to Kohler, faces a myriad of crises that requires a unified front in environmental conservation and sustainable development. But the current international system, established after WW2, is inapt at addressing these challenges and enforcing remedies, he pointed out. Korea and Germany face similar problems, as both have experienced military destruction, national division and diplomatic challenges. \u201cWe have also demonstrated to the world that dedication and innovation can overcome our hardships and achieve prosperity,\u201d Kohler said. \u201cEurope\u2019s lesson is that cooperation is the smarter way toward progress. Peaceful cooperation is the hope of rational people around the world. Rational people make the world work.\u201dAs part of an international advisory group, Kohler said he has proposed a model of global partnership to the United Nations for the post-2015 development agenda.This year is pivotal for the world to pave the way for sustainable globalization, he stressed, adding that democratic nations should partner for creative solutions.\u201cIn a world where nations are interconnected economically, politically and environmentally, the challenges we face require a new paradigm of cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to reform the international order based on a new model of participation and partnership across diverse stakeholders.\u201dThis requires a mentality and approach of \u201ctreating others as one wishes to be treated,\u201d so that different ethnic groups and governments can converge on their common problems, he added. Kim Hwang-sik, former Korean prime minister and ADEKO president, highlighted Kohler\u2019s contribution to the German reunification as a foreign policy adviser to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\u201cMr. Kohler was the finance minister in charge of unifying the German currencies and economies,\u201d Kim said in a speech. \u201cHe remarked on his visit to Korea in 2010 that our unification could come sooner than expected, and South Korea should make preparations for it.\u201d Kim added, \u201cMr. Hartz, who masterminded the 2002 Hartz labor and welfare reforms, is well-known in Korea, even more than former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder whom he served.\u201dHartz explained Germany\u2019s new system of employment and labor market reforms, as the country enters an aging society.

At least six other people are missing in floods that have ravaged mountain districts of six provinces and autonomous regions in central and southeastern China. More than a quarter-million people have been moved to temporary shelters, and major damage has been inflicted on buildings and crops.Apart from the two schoolchildren, 42 others have died due to floods and heavy rains, including 16 in the collapse of a nine-story building in the city of Guiyang following a landslide. Eight other people were killed in the central province of Hunan when a bus skidded into a guardrail and overturned.The Guangxi regional government said 21 other kindergarten students were sent to the hospital in the school bus accident on Friday, with three listed in serious condition. The bus was licensed to carry 11 people, but had a total of 26 on board. The driver, teachers and school administrators have been taken into custody, the government said. Overloaded buses have been involved in accidents killing scores of children in recent years as local schools are closed and consolidated into larger campuses farther away from the children's village homes.Seasonal rains cause major flooding around China almost every year.

In a move to reduce unemployment and help boost Germany's economic growth during his tenure, Schroeder unveiled a series of reform measures between 2003 and 2005 called the Agenda 2010.Dubbed the Hartz plan, the measures called for a cut in unemployment benefits to entice people to get back into the workforce as well as increase labor flexibility by allowing for more part time jobs, among others. South Korea is now faced with a similar problem as negotiations for a more flexible labor market have been stalled with unionized workers resisting the government's push to give corporatemanagement more leeway in laying off workers as part of efforts to improve its stagnant economy.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark, former Indonesian leader Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and other high-profile figures made their opening remarks at the 10th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity.The forum began its three-day schedule Wednesday to discuss a wide range of issues including North Korea\u2019s nuclear problem, Korea\u2019s reunification, maritime disputes in the South China Sea, and education and cultural exchanges.\u00a0 Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder speaks during a session on Germany\u2019s post-unification structural reforms at the 10th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity on Jejudo Island onThursday.

Geoeconomics bring more trade, investment, infrastructure, tourism and exchanges and others,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that the economic cooperation can help soften the rough geopolitical edges.\u201dTouching on Europe\u2019s peace-building efforts, former German leader Schroeder said that enhanced regional cooperation and integration will help establish the basic foundation for peace and regional development.In his lecture held prior to the opening ceremony, Schroeder spoke of the need for a \u201ccourageous, far-sighted\u201d political leadership should South Korea want to envision a stable, successful post-unification era.Sharing his experience in pushing for Agenda 2010 \u2015 a series of bold structural reforms in Germany in the 2000s, which led to an electoral defeat \u2015 Schroder said that a politician should be able to \u201ctake risks\u201d to carry out challenging, unpopular policy initiatives should they help eventually promote long-term national interests.By Song Sang-ho, Korea Herald correspondent\u00a0 (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","514":"Global educational leaders pledged Thursday to raise the quality of education and encourage life-long learning the world over as the world's largest education forum closed.\u00a0\u00a0More than 1,500 educators, policymakers and heads of international organizations\u00a0 gathered here for the World Education Forum 2015.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past three days, they discussed how far the world had come toward meeting the Millennium Development Goal of ensuring primary education for all children, set in 2000.\u00a0\u00a0The forum culminated in the adoption of the Incheon Declaration, which will be reflected in the United Nations' post-2015 agenda to be announced in September, and guide the U.N. education agency's policy for 195 U.N. member states.\u00a0\u00a0The declaration calls for ensuring at least nine years of education to all children; greater life-long learning opportunities for adults; and the transfer of education know-how and technology to developing countries by 2030.\u00a0\u00a0This is the third forum after ones in Thailand and Senegal in 1990 and 2000, respectively. \u00a0\u00a0U.N.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim; UNESCO director general Irina Bokova; and Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the mother of Qatar\u2019s current emir.\u201cThe 2015 WEF has a great significance in that education chiefs from all over the world will gather in Incheon and reach a global consensus for the betterment of education,\u201d Kim Young-gon, secretary-general of the WEF Host committee secretariat, said Monday. \u201cSouth Korea will carry out its role as an education leader, while making sure that (the forum) will leave a lasting, favorable impression on participants.\u201d Volunteer workers for the World Education Forum 2015 pose for a photo at their official appointment ceremony in Incheon on April 30. (Incheon)Organizations involved in the forum include U.N. Children\u2019s Fund, the U.N. Development Program, U.N. Women, U.N. Population Fund, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and World Bank. The forum is the largest education-related global conference, and succeeds the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand, in 1990 and World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, in 2000.The focal point of the two preceding meetings had been the \u201cEducation for All\u201d movement, a UNESCO-led drive devoted to providing quality basic education for all children, youth and adults. Initiated at Jomtien, the agenda took a step forward in Dakar when the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to the EFA and identified six goals to be met by 2015. They include expanding early childhood education, providing free primary education for all, achieving gender equality, improving quality of education and increasing adult literary.Incheon will see how far each country has come in realizing these goals, along with a general evaluation of what has been accomplished in terms of education circles around the globe. In the course of self-assessment, participants will also agree on the new objectives that should be reached prior to the next meeting.In the EFA Global Monitoring Report published in 2014, UNESCO\u2019s Bokova said it was clear that new education goals set in 2000 would not be achieved by 2015. She urged governments to step up efforts as \u201cEquality in access and learning must stand at the heart of future education goals. We must ensure that all children and young people are learning the basics and that they have the opportunity to acquire the transferable skills needed to become global citizens.\u201d She also suggested that the new goals must be \u201cclear and measurable\u201d which will allow the necessary tracking and monitoring. The assessment will play a part in the subsequent discussions that will be conducted throughout the forum.The subjects to be discussed by the panels include the future global education agenda, education development plans, gender equality in education, post-tertiary education, guaranteeing free quality education for all, vocational training for youth and adults.The pinnacle of the forum will be the Incheon Declaration, which will be announced at the closing of the WEF 2015. The declaration and the Incheon Framework for Action will present the guidelines for global education until 2030.The main idea for the declaration will be to provide equal and comprehensive quality education for all, and to promote lifelong education. The five key themes are right to education, equity in education, inclusive education, quality education and lifelong learning.This is also connected to how technology can play a role in providing equal learning opportunities, such as online courses for the masses.One of the plenary sessions on the second day of the forum will discuss the essential role education plays in a country\u2019s development. The discussion will be led by Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned economist and a special adviser to the U.N. chief on the Millennium Development Goals. There, Korean delegates will present how education played a critical part in helping the country achieve rapid economic development in a short period of time. Another session on the third day will discuss how education can contribute to the post-2015 sustainable development and solving the global issues of today. The WEF\u2019s outcome will be aligned to the education target of the global development agenda to be adopted at the U.N. High-Level Summit in September to form a single education agenda, according to the organizers.As part of the event, the organizers plan to hold an exhibition about the country\u2019s education policies, along with education-related policies of other member states and organizations taking part in the forum. Participants will also be offered a peek at how Korean public organizations and education offices use ICT in their education, vocational training models at high schools, and the country\u2019s role in the global citizenship education.Global citizenship education is one of the U.N.\u2019s education initiatives that aims to train learners of all ages to become responsible global citizens, by equipping them with values and knowledge based on respect for human rights, social justice, diversity, gender equality and environmental sustainability.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","528":"South Korea's top financial regulator said Monday that it will allow customers to open bank accounts without physically visiting brick-and-mortar offices from later this year as part of efforts to ease regulations on the financial industry and boost financial technology, or fintech.\u00a0\u00a0Under the current financial laws, local financial institutions must identify the name of an individual who opens a bank account by checking their identification cards and signatures in person.\u00a0\u00a0The Financial Services Commission said starting from December, customers do not have to visit bank offices and can open their new bank accounts by sending scanned identification cards, having online interviews or allowing the banks to cross-check their different accounts opened in other financial institutions.\u00a0\u00a0Financial companies should use other means at the same time to check their customers' identity through text messages or telephone calls, the regulator added.\u00a0\u00a0The FSC said it will encourage banks to establish a computation system that makes the indirect identification process possible until August and have trial tests in September.\u00a0\u00a0The FSC plan came as the country's financial authorities are moving to lift barriers and obstacles that have hampered the development of fintech firms and internet-only banks.\u00a0\u00a0Financial players have pointed out that the strict face-to-face regulation has been the biggest obstacle to attracting customers to online-based businesses.

But the North did not make any comments on Hyon's reported execution.\u00a0\u00a0South Korea called on North Korea to stop making insulting remarks toward Park and to reflect on itself instead.\u00a0\u00a0\"The South Korean government strongly rebukes North Korea for swearing at the South's leader with insults,\" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the Ministry of Unification, said at a press briefing.\u00a0\u00a0\"I think there is nothing worth responding to the North's claims, but it is regrettable that the North shows its level by insulting the leader from a country who seeks dialogue with anti-humanity and anti-feminine remarks,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0If North Korea's alleged execution of Hyon is confirmed, it would mark another high-profile public execution by the North. In late 2013 Kim ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek.\u00a0\u00a0The allegation also came as North Korea has recently claimed that it successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, raising security concerns in the region.\u00a0\u00a0Experts said that the North's criticism of the South is aimed at blocking public agitation in the communist country.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hopes for improvement in inter-Korean ties may fade out.

(Yonhap)His visit here, the first in 15 months, came amid the North's growing threats. It recently announced the successful test-launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, which would provide the country with an advanced way of delivering a nuclear warhead. The North also fired hundreds of artillery shells into the waters just north of the Yellow Sea border with the South last week.\u00a0\u00a0Kerry stressed that such provocations show that the communist nation is running against Washington's efforts to resume dialogue and improve bilateral ties. He said the North should first demonstrate a genuine willingness to fulfill its denuclearization commitments.\u00a0\"To this moment, particularly with its recent provocations, it is clear that (North Korea) has not even come close to meeting that standard,\" he said, adding that consultations are under way to increase pressure either through sanctions or other means.\u00a0In a separate meeting with Kerry, President Park Geun-hye said Seoul and Washington should send a consistent message urging North Korea to abandon its provocations, according to Park's office.\u00a0\u00a0Last weekend, Kerry traveled to Beijing, where he voiced hope that a nuclear deal with Iran will send a positive message to North Korea.\u00a0\u00a0Kerry told Park that Seoul and Washington should make strategic and creative efforts to induce North Korea to embrace change, noting Washington's nuclear deal with Tehran left only North Korea isolated.

In his trip to Seoul in April 2014, Obama used the same expression.\u00a0\u00a0Kerry's statement, however, came amid lingering doubts here about whether the Obama administration is taking a balanced approach. \u00a0\u00a0Addressing the U.S. Congress last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe refused to offer a clear apology for the wartime sex slavery. U.S. officials, nonetheless, spoke much of Abe's speech as Washington and Tokyo beef up their alliance.\u00a0\u00a0The two sides revised joint defense guidelines to allow Japan to expand the role of its self-defense forces abroad.\u00a0\u00a0Kerry said \"nothing can be done\" by Japan without South Korea's consent in terms of issues related to the security of the peninsula.\u00a0\u00a0He plans to visit the U.S. military base in Yongsan and deliver a lecture on cybersecurity at Korea University later in the day before heading back home.

The NPAD won none, even losing to independent candidate Chun Jung-bae in Gwangju, another voting district the party was expected to win.The Saenuri Party\u2019s wins also came in spite of ongoing prosecutorial probes on leading ruling bloc officials accused of graft. The corruption charges were expected to sway public opinion against the NPAD.

That\u2019s about it.\u201dLee, who is also a practicing dentist, has been serving as the head of the KOFIH since 2012. His organization is the only South Korean public agency that provides health care support to North Korea. Some of its ongoing projects include establishing a health screening center in the Gaeseong Industrial Complex for North Korean workers, as well as supporting North Korean tuberculosis patients in its northern free-trade city of Rason.\u00a0Lee Soo-ku, president of Korea Foundation for International Healthcare, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul on Wednesday. (Lee Sang-sub\/The Korea Herald)In 2008, the agency completed its renovation of the Onjeong Community Hospital in North Korea\u2019s Goseong County. The hospital, which is responsible for about 5,000 people living in the county, now has fully-equipped facilities including a dental clinic. But Lee said South Korea was still not doing enough to support North Koreans who are in need of quality health care, especially pregnant women, tuberculosis patients, and children suffering from chronic malnutrition.\u201cMany experts estimate that about 8 percent of the entire North Korean population is suffering from tuberculosis,\u201d he said. \u201cAs many already know, a lot of North Koreans are malnourished. Those who suffer from malnutrition are especially vulnerable to TB. And because anti-TB drugs can cause a number of adverse effects, such as drug-induced hepatitis, taking the drug can be especially painful and difficult for malnourished patients.\u201dLee said because of malnutrition and scarcity of medicines, the number of North Korean patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is rising. MDR-TB is a form of TB infection caused by bacteria that are resistant to at least two of the most powerful first-line treatment anti-TB drugs. The condition, which is much more dangerous and difficult to treat than TB, is often caused by the TB patient not taking the medication properly, or stopping his or her treatment due to expense or scarcity of medicines.\u201cThis is why I suggested establishing a health screening center at the Gaeseong Industrial Complex. If 8 percent of the entire population is suffering from TB, I assumed there could also be patients among those who work at the complex,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some 54,000 North Korean workers working at the complex, along with about 800 South Korean workers. But the size of the clinic for North Korean workers is about one-fifth size of the one for South Korean workers. \u201cSupporting North Korean TB patients cannot be done by simply sending anti-TB drugs,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is needed is a solid residential and medical facility that can quarantine MDR-TB patients, TB-screening equipment for prompt detection of infectious patients and stronger measures to combat malnutrition in the country.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s health care system, which emphasized free cost and preventive care, fell apart during the \u201cArduous March\u201d \u2015 a great famine that accompanied the country\u2019s economic crisis from 1994 to 1998. According to a number of North Korean defectors interviewed by the KOFIH, a lot of doctors in the North aren\u2019t paid enough or paid at all, and therefore aren\u2019t motivated to do their jobs. Many of them are involved in illicit drug sales.Because patients are assigned to a specific doctor in the region by the regime, they are not allowed to see other medical professionals even if they are not satisfied with the treatment they get from their designated doctor. As a result, those with money bribe the doctors that they would like to see, while the impoverished are often left with no health care options.Some of the most vulnerable to the current system include pregnant women. As of 2010, North Korea\u2019s maternal mortality ratio was 81 women per 100,000 live births. South Korea\u2019s ratio was 16, while Japan and China\u2019s ratios were 5 and 37, respectively. According to KOFIH\u2019s 2013 data, less than 10 percent of North Korea\u2019s obstetricians and gynecologists have been trained in newborn care, and no family doctors in small regional clinics have been trained in emergency obstetric and newborn care, childbirth and general gynecology. Data also showed that small regional clinics\u2019 medical equipment for childbirth were in poor condition. More than 70 percent of emergency obstetrical kits at the clinics either were either in poor condition or could not be used, while 68.3 percent of equipment needed for intravenous therapy were also in poor condition. Also, 68.3 percent of the sterilizers were in poor maintenance. Poor sterilization of medical equipment can lead to infection of patients in the facility. In North Korea, 15 percent of women who die due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth die from sepsis, a whole-body inflammation caused by an infection. To foster experts on North Korean health care, the KOFIH has been running a special educational program for activists and health care professionals since 2013. Lee stressed that humanitarian support for North Koreans should not be affected by inter-Korean relations. Some of the KOFIH\u2019s projects were suspended after the North\u2019s 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan.\u201cPresident Park Geun-hye said she\u2019d expand humanitarian support for North Korea during her recent Dresden speech and I thought she was taking the right approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should think of giving health care support to North Korea as preparation for the two Koreas\u2019 unification.\u201dHe said one of the most critical issues was malnutrition of North Korean children. \u201cA lot of North Korean children are experiencing so many health problems because of malnutrition. And one of them is iodine deficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cLack of iodine can severely affect a child\u2019s brain and intellectual prowess, which can lead to developmental disabilities. If we don\u2019t do anything about this, there will be more social costs to tackle this issue in the future, especially after reunification.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","541":"South Korea urged Japan Thursday to abide by the spirit of its Pacifist Constitution in implementing its new defense policy.\"We expect discussions on Japan's defense policy to proceed in the direction of contributing to peace and stability in the region while sticking to the spirit of the Pacifist Constitution,\" foreign ministry spokesman Noh Kwang-il said at a press briefing.In particular, he added, South Korea will never accept any measure related to its national interests and the security of the peninsula without Seoul's prior consent.The government's firm stance came in response to the Shinzo Abe administration's legislative campaign to expand the role of the country's military abroad.The conservative leader has sought to reinterpret the constitution adopted after Japan's defeat in World War II.Japan recently agreed with the United States on a fresh package of joint defense guidelines.

He replaced Ri Yong-ho, who was then regarded as the No. 1 man in the armed forces. Despite his stellar rise up the military ladder, he also had his own share of tribulations. Just a few months after he was promoted to vice marshal, he got demoted to four-star general. In May 2013, he also lost his position as the chief of the Army\u2019s general staff to Kim Kyok-sik, another prominent military figure. He was then demoted again to three-star general and posted to the 5th Corps in charge of the central frontline in the North\u2019s Gangwon Province. But last June, he reemerged to prominence and took the post of the chief of the People\u2019s Armed Forces. He also became a member of the powerful National Defense Commission.Since then, Hyon was seen frequently accompanying Kim when the leader was conducting on-site inspections of military installations and joining special military or national events. Any member of Kim\u2019s entourage is regarded as being in his inner circles.Last July, Hyon was with Kim when the leader paid his respect to the late national founder Kim Il-sung during a ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of his death at the Geumsusan Palace of Sun.

The United Nations has an entire commission devoted to North Korean human rights, and South Korea has nothing,\" Halvorssen said, criticizing South Korean lawmakers who have been \"invisible in this fight.\"Since the first draft bill to improve North Korea's human rights situation was filed with the National Assembly in 2005, no major progress has been made.The U.S. and Japan, meanwhile, adopted legislation on North Korea's human rights situation in 2004 and 2006, respectively.\"The South Korean government, every year, provides $1.7 billion of aids to foreign countries,\" said Garry Kasparov, the chairman of HRF and leader of the International Coalition, pointing out that \"not a single dime has been given to the North Korean society.\" He also criticized South Korean conglomerates that provide huge support to foreign countries while being ignorant of the defectors in the South.People from many fields, including Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and professor at Stanford University Larry Diamond, have joined the coalition to take part in the action.The HRF was established in 2005 and is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving human rights all over the world. Halvorssen has joined a South Korean activist group in sending balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets to the North in 2013 and 2015. (Yonhap)","554":"South Korea expressed hope Wednesday that the two Koreas would stage reunions as scheduled next month for families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, made the comment a day after North Korea warned that it could cancel the reunions in anger over President Park Geun-hye's recent address to the U.N. General Assembly.The two Koreas have agreed to stage the reunions for 100 separated family members from each side on Oct. 20-26 at Mount Kumgang, a scenic mountain resort on the North's east coast. The reunions are a key part of a recent deal that defused military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea said Tuesday that the upcoming reunions have been \"put at serious peril,\" due to what it claims is Park's \"reckless confrontation row.\"In an address to the U.N. on Monday, Park called on North Korea to embrace reform and openness rather than carrying out a long-range rocket.She also said a rocket launch would harm the hard-won mood for inter-Korean dialogue and undermine the efforts to resume the long-stalled talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.There is speculation that North Korea could launch a long-range rocket in October to put a satellite into orbit as part of its celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party. Park also urged North Korea to improve its dismal human rights record by heeding to international concerns.The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea denounced Park's speech as \"an unpardonable provocation\" and called on South Korea to apologize over slandering North Korea.\"If the South Korean authorities let loose a string of confrontational invectives as now, the event may prove completely abortive,\" according to the committee, which handles inter-Korean affairs.Family reunions have long been affected by political situations on the Korean Peninsula. The two Koreas last held family reunions in February 2014.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue, as most separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die. (Yonhap)","555":"The Unification Ministry expressed deep regret Wednesday over North Korea's threat to cancel the upcoming reunions of separated families, urging the North not to politicize the humanitarian issue.Late Tuesday, North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification threatened to scrap the family reunions slated for late October as President Park Geun-hye urged North Korea not to push ahead with its satellite launch.Park made the comments in her speech on Monday at the U.N. General Assembly, where she called on the North to walk the path toward openness rather than provocations.Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, voiced deep regret over the North's threat, encouraging Pyongyang to honor the two Koreas' recent landmark deal on promoting civilian inter-Korean exchanges and easing tension.\"The South Korean government urges North Korea to immediately stop its threats and unilateral condemnation and to sincerely honor the inter-Korean deal,\" Jeong told a regular press briefing.He said that North Korea should not put the humanitarian issue at risk, due to political reasons.On Aug. 25, South and North Korea agreed to defuse military tension and seek to hold the reunions for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The two Koreas plan to hold the event for 100 families from each side on Oct. 20-26 at the scenic resort on the North's Mount Kumgang.There is growing speculation that North Korea is likely to launch a long-range rocket around the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party which falls on Oct. 10.Experts view it as a cover for ballistic missile tests. The North has also hinted at conducting a fourth nuclear test by saying that all the facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex have returned to normal operations. It conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013. (Yonhap)","556":"President Park Geun-hye returned home Wednesday after a high-profile trip to New York for the U.N. General Assembly.The trip culminated in a series of addresses to the U.N. where Park urged North Korea not to go ahead with a long-range rocket launch.North Korea has defied international pressure and renewed its resolve to carry out a launch to put a satellite into orbit, calling it an exercise of its sovereign right.There is speculation that North Korea could launch a long-range rocket in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.Another key issue was Park's pledge of US$200 million in aid to poor countries under the \"Better Life for Girls\" initiative as part of Seoul's efforts to boost contributions to sustainable development.The aid is designed to help provide quality education to girls and strengthen health services for them in 15 countries, including Nepal, Senegal and Bolivia over the next five years.On Friday, member states of the U.N. adopted a new sustainable development agenda and set 2030 as the target year for achieving the goals that call for, among other things, ending poverty, protecting the planet and providing high-quality education.Park received a big boost as the U.N. held a high-level meeting on the \"Saemaeul Movement,\" or the new community movement launched by her late father, then-President Park Chung-hee, in the 1970s.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Saemaeul Movement -- which is credited with helping modernize the then-rural South Korean economy - has spread in countries ranging from Asia to Africa \"like a forest fire.\"She briefly met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and discussed a planned trilateral summit involving China in either late October or early November.A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to tensions in the region.Park has also announced South Korea's plan to dispatch additional military engineers to conflict zones for reconstruction and humanitarian activities. Park did not provide details as to the size and specific countries to which South Korea will dispatch the troops.

This year\u2019s IWFC also puts strong emphasis on innovation in fire management. In addition to world-class experts\u2019 knowledge, the international big-event will present state-of-the-art technologies on fire security systems and solutions, offering ample opportunities for exporters and buyers around the globe. As a representative of South Korea\u2019s leading expertise of 40 years in afforestation and firefighting know-how, it will introduce the latest applications of information and communications technology for real-time fire controls. Margareta Wahlstrom, first special representative of the secretary-general for U.N. Disaster Risk Reduction and the head of UNISDR, has stepped up as this year\u2019s special speaker. Wahlstrom has gained world recognition for her extensive experience in both disaster relief operations and disaster risk management, with the United Nations system and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.Eleven keynote speakers will share their expertise on the legacy of fire, community and wild-land fire and cohesive global fire management strategy. Stephen J. Pyne, regent\u2019s professor of Arizona State University School of Life Sciences and Winston S.W.

According to Rep. Park Dae-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party, the daily travel cost for foreigners visiting Seoul recorded $438 this year, ranking it as the 13th highest in the world and third in Asia. The cost includeS $310 for accommodation and $128 for food expenses.\u00a0 Korea Tourism Organization officials welcome Chinese tourists arriving in Seoul for China\u2019s National Day holiday Friday at Incheon International Airport. (Yonhap)The ranking was determined based on the Corporate Travel Index, an annual report released by Business Travel News in the U.S.\u00a0The average daily travel cost of 100 major cities in the world was $351, down by $17. Seoul\u2019s cost, however, rose by $12. Seoul\u2019s ranking has sharply climbed over the past few years. In 2011, Korea stood at 58th with $332, jumping to 25th with $426 by last year. Of the 100 cities, Caracas in Venezuela topped the ranking with $1,325 this year, followed by London with $576 and Hong Kong with $529. While the rising travel cost drew concerns, Korea has seen a sharp drop in the number of tourists since the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak hit the country in late May. The number of visitors declined by 40 percent in July, and the booking rate for tours also plummeted by over 80 percent in the summer, according to tourism officials. As part of the efforts to draw more tourists, Seoul Metropolitan Government vowed Tuesday to hold a welcome week for foreign visitors in early October, particularly targeting Chinese tourists during China\u2019s National Day holiday. From Oct. 1-10, the city will run various welcoming events in tourist spots such as Myeong-dong, Itaewon and Gangnam. It will open nine temporary tourist information booths in the city to better support the visitors, officials said. The municipality also vowed to compensate tourists on-site if any overcharging cases are confirmed. Over 210,000 Chinese visitors are expected to arrive in Seoul on holiday in October, up about 30 percent year-on, they said. Under the slogan of \u201cThe Time is Now,\u201d Seoul City has implemented a wide range of tourism promotion measures over the summer. While injecting 23 billion won ($19.2 million) to the MERS-hit tourism industry, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon flew to China for a \u201ctourism sales trip.\u201dAs of August, the number of tourists recovered to about 74 percent compared to the last year, the city said. During Chuseok, a large number of Chinese visitors also traveled to Jejudo Island, one of the most popular sightseeing regions.From Friday to Monday, about 40,000 foreign tourists visited the island, which is nearly equivalent to half the number of total foreign visitors to the island in July, the Jejudo Island tourism authorities said.

(Yonhap)","560":"The following is the full text of President Park Geun-hye's speech delivered on Monday at the 70th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Fellow delegates,I would like to first extend my congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations. I would also like to congratulate you, Mr. Lykketoft, former Speaker of the Danish Parliament, on your election as President of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly. The United Nations, established seventy years ago after overcoming the calamities of war, was a beacon of hope for all people around the world.This was because of the trust and hope towards the UN's spirit of putting people at the center despite the constraints of realpolitik. Despite the many challenges and criticisms, the UN has been making tremendous contributions to promoting the common good for humanity.Even as we speak, the blue helmets - a symbol of peace - of UN Peacekeeping Operations are greatly contributing to international peace and security.The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 provided a groundbreaking occasion to promote human rights, while the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court marked conspicuous progress towards institutionalizing the protection of human rights.The Millennium Development Goals, launched in 2000, was the most successful poverty eradication campaign in the history of the UN, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty. And few places in the world would see the UN's efforts make as much a difference as in the Republic of Korea.\u00a0 This year also carries special meaning for the Republic of Korea - a year that brings both the joy of marking the 70th anniversary of our liberation and the anguish of going into the 70th year of our division. During the past 70 years, the Republic of Korea rose above the ordeals of partition and war and went on to simultaneously achieve industrialization and democratization and the UN has stood with the Republic of Korea since the founding of our government to this very day.\u00a0 The values and ideals upheld by the UN - global peace, promoting human rights and common prosperity - embodied the very vision of the Republic of Korea.\u00a0 And the future that Korea is envisioning is in sync with the aspirations of the UN.\u00a0 The challenges pursued and achievements made by the Republic of Korea over the years are a testament to how the UN's goal for a better world has been successfully manifested. Mr. President,Notwithstanding these efforts by the UN and the international community, humanity today is confronted with multiple, simultaneous challenges in all corners of the world. To this day, there is no shortage of conflicts, big and small, and extreme civil wars.The surge in extremist groups that ISIL represents is now a global concern that needs to be urgently addressed.A single photo of Aylan Kurdi captures how such instability is unleashing the greatest humanitarian refugee crisis since the Second World War. Global climate change is even threatening the lives of our future generations; Ebola and other infectious diseases are causing countless victims, awakening us to the importance of health security.\u00a0 Today, no one in our global village is free from these global and transnational threats and challenges.As the international order experiences these tectonic shifts, now, more than ever, is the time to once again light up the beacon of hope, that is the UN throughout the world to promote international peace and security, human rights and common prosperity.Above all, the international community should rally around the UN and return to the founding spirit of the UN Charter that calls for faith \"in the dignity and worth of the human person.\" We must build a UN that is strong, carry the banner of renewed multilateralism, and realize the value of human dignity based on freedom, human rights, justice, and the rule of law.As a nation that puts the peace and happiness of our global village at the center of its diplomatic endeavors, Korea will spare no effort and support the UN in addressing the challenges faced by the international community, while highlighting the ideals of humanism and the need to live up to those ideals.Mr. President,The UN's drive to produce a new post-2015 development agenda is also anchored to this people-centered spirit. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit three days ago, will set a historic milestone towards a better world that leaves no one behind.\u00a0 No more than half a century ago, the Republic of Korea was among the poorest countries in the world. Today, it is one of the world's top fifteen economies.In the course of achieving this 'Miracle on the Han River,' we drew immense strength from the assistance and development cooperation of the international community.\u00a0 In this regard, I believe the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be an important stepping stone that can lead to a second and third miracle around the world. The Republic of Korea, holding the current presidency of ECOSOC, which will be playing a key role in the implementation of this development agenda, will actively contribute to achieving the development goals.Along the way, the Republic of Korea will actively share our development experiences and know-how with the international community.In the meantime, we have been sharing with developing countries the experiences of the Saemaul Undong (New Community Movement), which served as a springboard for Korea's leap forward. I believe that the Saemaul Undong can maximize the utility of development cooperation with developing countries, given that it ignites a sense of confidence and ownership through competition and incentives, and lays the groundwork for self-help in communities with the engagement of the local people.Two days ago, we co-hosted with the UNDP and the OECD a Special High-Level Side Event on the Saemaul Undong, and agreed to work together to help eradicate poverty and build transformative local communities in developing countries.We will further expand our efforts so that the Saemaul Undong can develop into a 'new paradigm for rural development' in developing countries.Another important driving force behind Korea's economic development was the human talent that has been nurtured through unsparing investment.\u00a0 Education is the key sustainable development agenda that helps empower the individual and achieve national development. Korea has been actively engaging in the Global Education First Initiative as a Champion country. We hosted the World Education Forum with UNESCO last May and led the adoption of the 'Incheon Declaration', which sets the global education goals to be achieved by 2030.Going forward, the Republic of Korea will continue to make such efforts in the area of education.In particular, Korea will continue to work with UNESCO to spread global citizenship education.Next, Korea will also play a strong role in strengthening global health security.In addition to dispatching a disaster response team to Sierra Leone to help fight Ebola late last year, Korea announced that it would contribute 100 million dollars over the next five years to support capacity-building in developing countries at the 2nd meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda held in Seoul three weeks ago.In addition, the Republic of Korea plans to pursue projects to support developing countries worth 200 million dollars over the next five years under the 'Better Life for Girls Initiative'. Fellow delegates, Even as we achieved rapid industrialization, Korea has also been putting great energy into supporting the co-existence of man and nature.Our designation of April 5 as Arbor Day and the promotion of forestation led to a 20-fold increase in the number of trees per hectare over the past 50 years. Since 1972, we designated green belt zones to curb development in the suburbs, thereby achieving harmony between the environment and development.Now, we are channeling our environmental advocacy to joining the international community's response to climate change.\u00a0 Dealing with climate change is an urgent task that we can no longer afford to put off. It is critical that the international community produce a concrete, meaningful outcome at the 2015 Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC this December. I believe that addressing climate change is not a burden, but a fresh opportunity to create future drivers of growth through technological innovation. Guided by that belief, Korea submitted a forward-leaning Intended Nationally Determined Contribution last June and is actively seeking to transition towards a low-carbon economy, while actively participating in the climate negotiations. In addition, as the host country of the Green Climate Fund Secretariat and the Global Green Growth Institute, Korea will continue to support climate action by developing business models relating to new energy industries and sharing them with developing countries.Ladies and Gentlemen,The UN's recent review of peace operations, peacebuilding as well as women, peace and security in line with a changing security environment, could not have come at a better time. As a country that experienced a devastating war and remains scarred to this day by partition, the Republic of Korea is acutely aware of the importance of peace and is strongly supporting the efforts of the UN to protect peace.To date, Korea has dispatched some 13,500 peacekeepers to 18 missions. Korean peacekeepers are being held in high regard for their exemplary and community-friendly peacekeeping and reconstruction activities.Upon consultations with the UN, Korea plans to make additional deployments to peacekeeping missions in the near future and will strengthen our substantive partnership with the African Union.To assist Syrian refugees flowing from the instability in the Middle East, Korea will step up its humanitarian assistance to the relevant countries. Korea is also pouring its efforts into laying the groundwork for peace in Northeast Asia - a region that continues to undergo persistent tensions and discord among countries. In Northeast Asia, we see a deepening of the Asia paradox phenomenon, where political and security cooperation lags behind the high-degree of economic interdependence among the countries in the region.Recently, new moves that could potentially have profound consequences for Northeast Asia's security order are leading to misgivings among countries in the region. Japan's recently-passed defense and security legislation should be implemented transparently and in a way that is conducive to friendly relations among regional countries and to peace and stability in the region.\u00a0 Pointing to Northeast Asia with its continuing tensions and discord, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon once described the region as a 'crucial missing link' with no regional cooperation mechanism.The reason I am pushing forward the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative is to reconnect that missing link and thereby create a virtuous cycle of trust building and increased cooperation.\u00a0 At the moment, consultations among the countries of the region are underway on a range of collaborative areas, including nuclear security, disaster management and health, and the accumulation of these experiences will also contribute to promoting global peace and cooperation.\u00a0 Such efforts on our part will also help to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which poses a serious threat to peace in Northeast Asia and beyond. Resolving the North Korean nuclear issue should be accorded the highest priority if we are to uphold the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and live up to the aspirations of humanity for a world without nuclear weapons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Last July, the Iran nuclear deal was reached. Now the international community should focus its efforts on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue - the last remaining non-proliferation challenge. In recent weeks, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again publicly intimated further acts of provocation that would violate UN Security Council resolutions. This will not only do harm to the hard-won mood for inter-Korean dialogue, but also undermine the efforts of the members of the six-party talks to reopen denuclearization talks. The DPRK would do well to choose reform and opening rather than additional provocations and to endeavor to free its people from hardship. Pushing ahead with provocations, including its nuclear development program, will undermine the values of humanity's peace espoused by the international community and the UN have been espousing. Should the DPRK boldly give up its nuclear ambitions and choose the path towards openness and cooperation, the Republic of Korea will work with the international community to actively support North Korea in developing its economy and improving the quality of life of its people. Ladies and Gentlemen,During the last 10 years, the UN has achieved significant progress, not least in terms of protecting human rights and advancing freedom.\u00a0 The concept of Responsibility to Protect was adopted at the 2005 UN World Summit, and legal accountability for those involved in genocide was defined with the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court.I believe that we should further strengthen the responsibility to protect in order to prevent the humanitarian crisis our world currently faces from deteriorating further.\u00a0 Last year, at this very podium, I stressed that sexual violence against women during armed conflicts, whenever or wherever it may have taken place, is unquestionably a violation of human rights and humanism.\u00a0 This year marks the 15th anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, and the international community should do justice to the occasion by paying greater attention to sexual violence against women in conflict situations.The most compelling reason is the fact that only a few of the victims of brutal sexual violence during World War II are still alive today. Solutions that can bring healing to their hearts need to be devised quickly, while these victims are still alive. The efforts of the UN High Commissioners of Human Rights and Special Rapporteurs on this issue must not be allowed to come to naught.There is no path to unlocking the future, if the past is not acknowledged.\u00a0\u00a0 We now hope the spirit of enduring partnership towards humanity that the UN embodies will resonate far and wide so that past wounds can be healed and a new future can unfold.One issue that has attracted great international attention in the realm of human rights realm over the past year is the human rights situation of the DPRK. The report of the Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the DPRK, published last year, called for the active response of the international community to address the North Korean human rights issue.In the wake of the report's release, not only would the UN Human Rights Council and the General Assembly adopt relevant resolutions, but no less than the Security Council would take the issue up for discussion. We once again call on the DPRK to heed the concerns of the international community and start improving the state of human rights.Ladies and Gentlemen,At the UN General Assembly last year, I proposed that a World Eco-Peace Park be built as a space to unfold dreams of peace within the demilitarized zone - the symbol of a divided Korean Peninsula. However, as the recent land mine provocation in the DMZ brought home, the inescapable reality we face is that peace on the Korean Peninsula can be jeopardized in a single moment. Fortunately, the two Koreas managed to reach an agreement on August 25 through high-level talks and are now standing at the juncture pointing to a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation.The impetus for moving this new virtuous cycle forward will come from the faithful implementation of the August 25 accord and fulfillment of concrete steps for reconciliation and cooperation by both Koreas. We must no longer use political and military reasons as excuses for turning a blind eye to humanitarian issues, in particular the reunion of the separated families. I hope we can embark on the path to regaining our common identity as one nation, through the official dialogue and range of exchanges provided for in the August 25 agreement. Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, and fellow delegates,On October 3, a few days from today, the German people will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of their reunification. Just as the UN blessed the birth of the Republic of Korea in 1948, I dream for the day to come soon when the entire world celebrates a unified Korea.Ending the seven-decades-long history of a divided Korean Peninsula - the last remaining vestige of the Cold War - will mark nothing less than a contribution to world peace.Not long ago, the Republic of Korea organized a journey by rail, called the Eurasia Friendship Express, that went through Russia and reached all the way to Europe. Those who took part in the journey came back deeply touched and moved.However, the train couldn't run through the DPRK as the rails there were closed off. I ask all of you here at the UN to lend us your strength so those doors are flung open and the air of peace can suffuse the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 A peacefully unified Korea will be a thriving democratic nation free of nuclear weapons and upholding of human rights.What is more, a unified Korean Peninsula, both as a symbol of peace in our global village and a new engine of growth - will contribute greatly to peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and beyond. I hope that the UN and all peace-loving countries will work together so that the ideals of peace and human dignity dreamt of by the UN founders 70 years ago can also be fulfilled through the unification of the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 On this grand journey towards a better world, you can rest assured that the Republic of Korea will be a companion that the UN and the international community can count on. Thank you.

General Assembly.Still, North Korea has defied international pressure and renewed its resolve to carry out the launch to put a satellite into orbit, calling it an exercise of its sovereign right.There is speculation that North Korea could launch a long-range rocket in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.A new rocket launch, if carried out, could prompt the U.N. to further tighten sanctions on North Korea, which has long been under an array of U.S. and international sanctions for its missile and nuclear tests.Park said a rocket launch could harm the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue between South and North Korea and undermine the efforts to resume the long-stalled talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.Last month, South and North Korea produced a breakthrough deal that defused tensions on the Korean Peninsula and set the stage for temporary reunions for families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.\"We must no longer use political and military reasons as excuses for turning a blind eye to humanitarian issues, such as reunion of separated families in particular,\" Park said.Park also called on the international community to concentrate efforts on ending North Korea's nuclear program, citing a recent nuclear deal reached between the United States, five other world powers and Iran.North Korea pledged to scrap its nuclear programs in exchange for diplomatic concessions and economic aid under a landmark 2005 nuclear deal with South Korea, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan.Still, the North later backtracked from its commitment and conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, drawing international condemnation and U.N. sanctions.

We protect Germany. We protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world, Saudi Arabia. We protect everybody. We protect everybody and we don't get reimbursement,\"Trump said during a news conference to announce campaign pledges on tax reforms.\"We lose on everything. We lose on everything, so we're going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that's going to get the cost down for running our country very significantly,\" he said.Trump said the trade deals the U.S. has with other countries \"are not sustainable\" and he would renegotiate them, but did not elaborate. South Korea also has a free trade agreement with the U.S. that has been in effect since 2012.It was the third time Trump has publicly criticized South Korea over the American troop presence.In July, he said that whenever South Korea \"is in trouble, our military takes care. You know we get nothing.\" In August, Trump also said that South Korea is making a fortune, but the U.S. sends its troops to defend the Asian ally in exchange for \"nothing.\" The criticism shows Trump's ignorance about American security interests and policy.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for 2014 for the upkeep of the U.S. troops, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Trump has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination for next year's election as he made a series of unbridled remarks on immigration and other sensitive issues that apparently struck a chord with conservatives.

Park toured an exhibition on Korean culture, including the traditional Korean clothes, or \"hanbok,\" and Korean food, at the Korean Cultural Service New York, South Korea's presidential office said.It is the first time that a sitting president has visited a South Korean cultural center since 1979, when South Korea opened its first overseas cultural center.The move underscored Park's commitment to enhancing South Korea's culture.South Korea views the culture industry as one of its future growth engines amid growing popularity of its pop culture, including soap operas and music, in China, Japan and other Asian countries in recent years.South Korea has designated the last Wednesday of every month as a culture day to provide the public with easier access to cultural events and sites.Park also met with more than a dozen Americans whom South Korea calls \"K-Culture supporters\" at the Korean Cultural Service New York. South Korea hopes that the supporters will help spread South Korean culture across the U.S.\"I have high expectations for your activities,\" Park told the supporters. She also expressed hope that the American supporters can help deepen mutual understanding between the two countries through culture.High-profile participants included Seth Andrew, a senior adviser to the chief technology officer at the White House.Andrew founded Democracy Prep Public Schools, a college preparatory school in New York, after being inspired by South Korean education while he taught English at a South Korean middle school, according to the presidential office.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for some leaders to help build momentum for a climate conference to be held in Paris later this year.Japanese public broadcaster NHK also carried a similar report.It marked the first time that Park and Abe held brief talks since March when they both attended the funeral for Singapore\u2018s founding father Lee Kuan Yew.Park has so far shunned bilateral talks with Abe due to his apparent refusal to acknowledge Japan\u2019s responsibility for its past atrocities, including sex slavery.Park has repeatedly pressed Japan to resolve the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan\u2018s World War II soldiers -- one of the knottiest issues between the two countries.Earlier this month, Park held summit talks with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and agreed to hold a trilateral summit with Japan in Seoul in either late October or early November.A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to the tensions in the region. China was represented by its prime minister at the previous summit.South Korea, China and Japan are key trade partners, but tensions still persist between South Korea and Japan and between China and Japan over territorial and other history-related issues.Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.

Her father had just passed away after being hospitalized for seven years. \u201cThe medical bills were just enormous,\u201d the 40-year-old said. \u201cMy siblings were too young, and my father had divorced my mother. I was the de-facto breadwinner of the family.\u201dJang was one of some 1,000 South Korean sex workers who gathered in central Seoul on Wednesday asking for the abolishment of the controversial anti-prostitution law, which has criminalized the buying and selling of sex since 2004.\u201cWe are telling the government that we are willing to and want to pay our income tax,\u201d she told The Korea Herald. \u201cAnd we are asking the government to regulate the industry and protect us with that tax money we are willing to pay. Right now we can\u2019t pay taxes (because sex trade is illegal) and are not eligible to receive a lot of welfare benefits and protection because of this.\u201dAmnesty International\u2019s recent endorsement of a global effort to decriminalize all forms of consensual sex work that \u201cdoes not involve coercion, exploitation or abuse\u201d has been stirring controversy in Korea, where both purchasers and sellers of sex can face criminal charges.\u00a0\u00a0South Korean sex workers participate Wednesday in a rally in central Seoul in protest of the antiprostitution law that has criminalized the sex trade since 2004. YonhapThe human rights group argued decriminalization was the best way to defend sex workers\u2019 rights, as it will encourage governments to introduce specific laws and policies that regulate sex work more effectively. The effectiveness of the Korean anti-prostitution law has been seriously questioned in recent years. In spite of the law, the number of female sex workers in Korea in fact increased by 3.8 percent from 2010-2013, from 4,917 to 5,103, according to data from the Gender Ministry. According to Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the number of illegal sex trade businesses that operate in unconventional places, such as residential buildings and Internet cafes, increased dramatically from 2010 to 2014, from 2,068 to 6,669.Jang said the government\u2019s current program to support sex workers failed to meet their practical needs. The former sex worker, who worked in brothels for about a decade, said many prostitutes continue to stay in the illegal business because they can\u2019t make a living otherwise. A number of her colleagues have been seriously abused by their customers since 2004, the year the anti-prostitution law was enacted, but could not report the abuse to the police as they are afraid of being criminally charged. She said she and her colleagues do not want the government to decriminalize sex trade completely, without any regulations. She wants brothels to be licensed by the government and for the authorities to monitor the industry. \u201cMany of us are in our 30s and 40s without formal education, and we have families to support. A lot of us are the breadwinners of our families,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government currently gives 400,000 won ($335) a month to those who quit sex work and are looking for another job. How do you make a living and support your family with 400,000 won a month? Many say we are lazy for not trying to find another job. But most people have no idea what it is like for women without an education to find a job that pays enough to support herself and her family.\u201dAccording to Hanteo National Union, a representative body of Korean sex workers, 80 percent of them did not attend or finish high school. A government study last year that surveyed 15 sex workers also showed that 86.6 percent of them grew up in broken homes, while 60 percent of them became involved in prostitution as teenagers after running away from home.In Korea, prostitution is closely associated with domestic abuse against children and teens. According to a joint study by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and Ewha Womans University which surveyed 219 runaway teens this year, 18.3 percent of them -- and 31.6 percent of those aged 14-16 -- said they had been involved in the sex trade at least once in their lives. The highest number of them, 66.7 percent, said they did it because they needed money, while 46.2 percent said they didn\u2019t have any place to stay, and 28.2 percent said it was because they needed food. It is estimated that the biggest reason why Korean teens run away from home is because of family conflicts and domestic violence.\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious circle,\u201d said Byun Hyun-ju from Women\u2019s Human Rights Commission of Korea. \u201cDomestic abuse leads to prostitution, and prostitution leads to other forms of abuse against women.\u201dIn spite of the continued demand from sex workers, the Korean government stands firm on its stance that the commercial sex trade cannot be legal. Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung said in that sex was \u201csomething that cannot be sold and bought.\u201dSarah Benson, the chief executive officer for a Dublin-based NGO supporting women affected by prostitution, said while no individual should be punished for selling sex, evidence shows that decriminalization of prostitution does not help the sex trade and or sex trafficking victims. According to Benson, Germany and the Netherlands did not see a decline in human trafficking and violence directed at prostitutes in spite of decriminalizing sex work early in the last decade.\u00a0 \u201cEven when you offer the opportunity to legitimize the business of prostitution, those who organize it (will) attempt to and continue to operate criminally,\u201d she said in a press meeting at the International Symposium on the Prevention of Sex Trafficking held in Seoul on Wednesday. \u201cAnd most importantly, the conditions for persons in prostitution do not improve, human trafficking increases because of the size of the sex trade increases. The ability of the police to target and challenge traffickers is compromised because when you make something a legitimate business then the opportunity to go on and investigate becomes more difficult.\u201dBenson said the sex trade is a very clear example of a hierarchy of power, and therefore purchasers of sex and traffickers should not be decriminalized. \u201cNobody is ever forced to buy sex,\u201d she said. \u201cThe person in prostitution in the vast majority of cases is somebody who is either coerced or (does so) for a variety of other reasons which are still based on vulnerability and lack of other options.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","570":"Women in or post-menopause are the most vulnerable to colorectal cancer among the Korean population, while the number of female patients who develop the disease is on rise nationwide, a hospital report showed.According to the report released by the Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Korean women aged 65 or older this year. For women in all age groups, it was the third most common cancer, following breast and thyroid cancer. According to National Cancer Center of Korea, the number of female colorectal cancer patients has been on the rise from 1999-2012, with an average annual increase rate of 4.3 percent. Colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Korean women aged 65 or older this year. (Yonhap)In Korea, the particular cancer has been generally regarded as a disease that is more common in men. Korea in fact had the third highest rate of colorectal cancer in men -- 58.7 men per 100,000 -- in the world back in 2012. In the same year, Korea had the fifth highest rate of colorectal cancer in women -- 33.3 women per 100,000 -- in the world, following Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. \u201cWhat many are not aware is that aging women are more vulnerable to this particular type of cancer,\u201d said Dr. Kim Kwang-ho from the hospital. \u201cOne of the reasons why so many elderly women develop the disease is because not a lot of them get screened regularly for colorectal cancer thinking it\u2019s more prone in men. But this has to change now.\u201dFrom 1993-2012, the five-year relative survival rate for Korean women colorectal cancer patients (65.9 percent), was significantly lower than their male counterparts (70.5 percent). While colorectal cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women aged 65 or older, it is the third highest cancer among Korean men in the same age group.According to Dr. Kim, women in and post-menopause are more vulnerable to the cancer because estrogen is what protects women from gaining excess belly weight which is significantly linked to colorectal cancer. Most women gain excess belly weight, especially inside the belly, as they go through menopause, as their estrogen levels drop. When women\u2019s menstrual cycle ends, body fat is often redistributed from the hips, buttocks and thighs to the abdomen. And those with excessive amounts of visceral fat have a higher chance of developing colorectal cancer.According to the hospital, 44.5 percent of Korean women who went through menopause develop abdomen-obesity, while only 32.1 percent of who are in their pre-menopause phase experience the same. \u201cOne\u2019s risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with increasing waist circumference,\u201d said the report. \u201cA woman\u2019s chance of developing the disease increases by 16 percent per 10 centimeter increase in her waistline.\u201dTo prevent the disease, Dr. Kim recommended that those aged 50 or older get regular screening, such as colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, every five to 10 years. People with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin testing at younger ages, he said. According to Kim, one can reduce their chance of developing the disease by 90 percent just by getting screened regularly. The doctor also recommended women aged 50 or older to be physically active, get enough calcium and avoid smoking. There is a good evidence that getting enough calcium helps protect against colorectal cancer. The doctor also stressed the importance of not smoking. \u201cWomen who smoke have a 20 percent higher chance of developing colorectal cancer than those who don\u2019t,\u201d he said.

The Korea Herald will publish a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country\u2019s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the first installment. \u2013 Ed.The afternoon was sunny and peaceful, as the crisp wind signaled the coming autumn in South Korea. But the story told by CH Govera, a 30-something man from Ethiopia, in an interview with The Korea Herald at a cafe in Seoul, was worlds away from the tranquility of the day.\u201cI could have been stopped at the airport if it wasn\u2019t so early at 5 a.m. in the morning,\u201d said Govera, choking up with emotion. \u201cI managed to sneak out of the country and I burst into tears when I boarded the plane.\u201dGovera, who was granted refugee status last month after several attempts over the past seven years, had taken a lead in establishing the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy back home, also known as Kinijit, ahead of the 2005 election to stand up to the government that had ruled his country for 25 years.\u201cThe opposition bloc saw the biggest-ever gains, but the government wouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d Govera said of the election, which triggered chaos that killed nearly 200 people in the postelection violence.\u201cI was soon arrested, jailed and tortured until officials from Red Cross and the United Nations made a visit to my prison,\u201d he said. While living in fear that he might be persecuted, Govera grabbed a rare chance to come to Korea for missionary training in 2008. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave as I was only demanding my political rights. But I had to get out of my country to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no luggage, I didn\u2019t tell anyone that I was leaving.\u201dLike many other asylum seekers in Korea, his first choice of destination was not Korea. \u201cMy first choice was England or Germany, but I just had to seize any chance to leave the country.\u201d Govera explained that Ethiopians would have to pay brokers a commission fee of $2,000 to $4,000 to secure a legitimate visa to enter Korea. The costs depend on the popularity of the destination, with the visa for the U.S. hovering around $200,000.After twists and turns, Govera was able to apply for asylum, but it took seven grueling years to finally be granted refugee status. \u201cNow, I feel like I am born again.\u201dSyrian refugees participate in a rally calling for the Korean government\u2019s help in front of the National Human Rights Commission in downtown Seoul on Sept. 13. (Yonhap)Govera is one of the 522 refugees as of July who have earned the status in Korea since the country began to accept refugees in 1994.\u00a0 Korea joined the U.N. Refugee Convention in 1992 and became the first Asian country to enforce the Refugee Act in 2013 to provide international refugees with social protection and residence.The number of those seeking asylum in Korea has surged since the law took effect, with the figure jumping from 423 in 2010 to 2,896 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Justice. But the government has granted refugee status to only a small portion of applicants, with 331 out of 9,155 asylum seekers having won legal status for resettlement during the five-year period.Korea\u2019s refugee acceptance rate stands at 3.6 percent, much lower than the average rate for U.N. member countries, which sits at 38 percent.According to the data, the largest numbers of migrants recognized as refugees were from Myanmar followed by Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Iran, while the biggest portion of refugee applicants were Pakistanis and Egyptians.Nearly half of the asylum seekers applied for refugee status for political or religious reasons. Amid the escalating conflicts within Syria, Korea saw a soaring number of Syrian asylum seekers here, but only three of the 740 applicants have succeeded in securing refugee status so far. Most of the Syrian applicants were granted humanitarian status instead of refugee status, which allows them to work and reside here until the war abates in their country. But those on humanitarian status are guaranteed a lower level of social protection than of refugees.Govera knew he would have to escape from the country to survive, but many others have arrived in Korea for other purposes without knowing they would end up applying for refugee status here.A 23-year-old Ethiopian, who only wanted to be identified by her nickname Mimi, told The Korea Herald that she had never considered herself an asylum seeker. \u201cI meant to go back to Ethiopia to continue my career and activities back home, as there is still so much to be done,\u201d said Mimi, who has been heavily involved in human rights activities and worked for the Ethiopian office of the World Bank for rural development projects before coming to Korea. \u201cWhile I was in Korea for a two-week human rights training course at a university in Seoul, I found out that the government arrested my father, brother and fellow activists to hunt me down,\u201d said Mimi. \u201cAs the government sees me as \u2018terrorist,\u2019 my return could put not only myself, but also my family in jeopardy.\u201dMimi received much-needed help from Refuge pNan, a Seoul-based human rights organization, to process her application for refugee status in January. She is waiting to be interviewed by immigration officers. Mimi herself admitted she was one of the extremely \u201clucky\u201d cases discovered and helped by human rights activists. Otherwise, she would not have known what steps to take next. Many of the asylum seekers, however,\u00a0don\u2019t even know whether they are entitled to refugee status, said Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for Advocates for Public Interest Law. Asylum seekers, thus, are poorly prepared for the application process involving document screening and interviews, which lowers the possibility for them to earn the status.\u201cOnce the refugee application is rejected, it seems difficult to reverse the decision in the following stages,\u201d Kim said. Even if migrants know they are in a situation where they can seek asylum, they face difficulties in proceeding with the application due to language barriers, lack of information and financial problems.\u201cWhen I first arrived in Korea, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I spoke no Korean. Everybody in the immigration office seemed unkind, even angry, and didn\u2019t explain the situation to me,\u201d said a 32-year-old\u00a0Bangladeshi man, who only wanted to be identified by Amin. Amin fled Bangladesh in 2009 after leading student activists against the government. He entered Korea on a tourist visa with the help of his uncle married to a Korean woman here.\u201cI financially relied on my uncle at first, but I had to leave his house after I saw him and his wife arguing about me,\u201d said Amin, who even spent some time in the streets, homeless. The language barrier hindered him from acquiring information about the application process here, which left him with no option but to stay and work here illegally part-time until someone came to rescue him. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, but I still had to survive. I knew I wasn\u2019t allowed to work without a work permit, but what options do I have? I cannot go back to my country. I will get killed there,\u201d Amin said.\u00a0 The Refuge Act stipulates that those who have applied for refugee status are entitled to find employment with a work permit issued by the government six months after the process begins. But the work permit is difficult to get, Amin said.\u00a0 \u201cI cannot afford to take time off work to apply for a permit and go back to check whether I got it and explain all the process to my boss,\u201d Amin said. Lawyer Kim also pointed out that asylum seekers are on a G-1 visa, which technically doesn\u2019t allow them to work. Despite the enforcement of the Refuge Act, many employers remain unaware that they could hire asylum seekers without any legal problems. \u201cIf the work permit is complicated to get, the government should provide asylum seekers with greater social protection,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWithout such a measure, it is an irony that the government only tries to\u00a0track down\u00a0those forced to illegally work here and deport them.\u201dJust a few days after Amin had the interview with The Korea Herald, he was caught by immigration officers and detained at a foreigner protection center in Hwaseong, where those ordered to leave Korea spend their final days before being sent back to their home countries.\u201cWhat will happen to me next? I am so scared ...\u201d Amin\u2019s last text message read.Nazmul Hossain, who founded the Refugee Community to help asylum seekers pursue their rights, said that the Refugee Act hasn\u2019t changed the \u201cmiserable lives\u201d of asylum seekers here. \u201cI had to go back to the immigration office almost five times to finally get the work permit,\u201d he said in fluent Korean. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more difficult for those who cannot speak Korean and don\u2019t understand the law to practice their rights?\u201d\u201cThe slow legal process prompts many of the asylum seekers to give up on asking for a work permit and just get a part-time job illegally, trapping them into a vicious cycle,\u201d he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","575":"President Park Geun-hye returned home Sunday from a visit to Washington after she and U.S. President Barack Obama reaffirmed their countries' alliance and their commitment to resolve the North Korean nuclear standoff.The two leaders pressed North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program and called their alliance \"a linchpin of peace and security\" not just on the Korean Peninsula but across the region.\"The summit dispelled worries among some critics that Seoul may be tilted toward China as Park attended the massive military parade in Beijing last month, widely seen as a show of force amid the growing rivalry between the U.S. and China.Obama said that Washington is prepared to engage North Korea as it did Iran and Cuba, but he made it clear Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons program.Iran has reached a deal with the U.S. and five world powers on curbing its nuclear capabilities in return for lifting sanctions.Cuba, one of a handful of governments with friendly ties with North Korea, has recently restored diplomatic relations with the U.S.\"As my administration has shown with Iran and with Cuba, we are also prepared to engage nations with which we have had troubled histories, but Pyongyang needs to understand it will not achieve the economic development it seeks so long as it clings to nuclear weapons,\" Obama said in a joint news conference with Park.Park's four-day visit, which marks her second trip to Washington as president after the first visit in 2013, was also full of gestures and remarks underlining the significance of relations with the U.S., South Korea's No. 1 ally, which fought alongside the country during the 1950-53 Korean War.\"I came here to convey South Koreans' mind that (we) will not forget those who helped us when we were in trouble,\" Park told a group of surviving veterans and family members of those who served in the Korean War after laying a wreath at the Korean War Veterans Memorial.In a gala dinner Wednesday, Park said South Korea is a \"reliable partner\" and the Korea-U.S. alliance is the linchpin of the United States' \"rebalance to Asia\" policy.

MacArthur led an amphibious operation, named \"the Incheon landing mission\" on Sept. 15, 1950, as the commander of the Allied Forces which fought against North Korean troops during the three-year conflict. \u00a0\u00a0The operation helped turn the tide for South Korea and the U.N. forces and set the stage for them to recapture the South Korean capital of Seoul from North Korea two weeks later.

Currently, eight local publishers author the textbooks, which are certified by the ministry before they hit the market.\u201cThe current textbooks are based on the universal historical viewpoint of academic circles and follow ministry guidelines. An attempt to reinstate state history books is an attempt to impose the historical interpretation of those in power (on students),\u201d 132 Yonsei professors said in their statement.\u201cForcing a monolithic view of history upon students infringes upon the impartiality and autonomy of education stipulated in the Constitution,\u201d they said.The joint statement follows a protest against the state textbooks by 160 professors from Korea University last Wednesday, another prestigious Seoul-based higher education institute. Late last month, 34 professors of history-related departments at Seoul National University also decried the ministry\u2019s move.The efforts to reinstate history textbooks for secondary education was put on overdrive last year, after privately authored textbooks had been accused of being inaccurate and ideologically biased. Hwang, upon taking office in August last year, has repeatedly stressed that students should be taught with \u201ca single version of history.\u201dBut such attempts have prompted fierce opposition, particularly from liberal educators. The left-leaning Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union last week announced that 15,701 teachers had signed a petition against the government pushing ahead with the contentious policy.Proponents of the policy say teaching one version of history can contribute to reducing ideological standoffs among people. The Parents\u2019 Association for Reviving Public Education claimed that many of the eight historical textbooks in the market were biased in favor of liberals, and accused the university professors who opposed state textbooks of also having bias and being \u201cunqualified as educators.\u201dThe standoff over history textbooks was noticeable during the ongoing parliamentary audit of government organizations. Members of opposition parties pointed out that state history textbooks were used to whitewash the dictatorial rule of former President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s, raising concerns that the books are likely to cater to demands of those in power. But the ruling Saenuri party said that state textbooks would actually help history lessons remain politically neutral.

The Korean government, which became the first Asian country to enforce the Refugee Act in 2013, stipulated by law that it would accept refugees recommended by the UNHCR.Under the program, the UNHCR relocates refugees to 28 countries, including the United States, Australia and Japan, which have agreed to grant them residence and protection to ease the burden of host countries near war zones. Korea is the second country to join the resettlement program following Japan, which began accepting refugees from a third country in 2010.The 30 selected Burmese refugees will be granted refugees status and F-2 visas that allow them to live and work here upon their arrival in December. The incoming refugees will receive Korean language courses and job training for up to one year at a refugee support center until the government decides where to relocate them.According to the government, the reasons for choosing to accept Burmese refugees, among others, were their similar cultural background and the well-established Burmese presence here, which they think will help them better integrate into Korean society.\u00a0 \u201cWe will run a pilot project to admit 30 refugees every year until 2017 and see whether we will continue the program after monitoring the results,\u201d an official from the Justice Ministry said. \u201cWe view the Korean government\u2019s attempt to resettle refugees as positive,\u201d said Shin Hye-in, spokeswoman for the Korean office of the UNHCR. \u201cIts success would depend on how Koreans embrace such a move.\u201dBut some critics slammed the government for reaching out to refugees abroad while it is already struggling to cope with the soaring number of refugees within the country.

The diseases included pneumonia, pertussis, respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus, which is one of the most common causes of severe diarrhea among infants and young children.Meanwhile, the number of postnatal care facilities also increased significantly since 2006, from 294 to 602 last year, buoyed by high demand from mothers here. As of this year, 68.8 percent of new Korean mothers opt to stay at such centers instead of home right after their deliveries. More than 60 percent of the centers are located in the Seoul and Gyeonggi regions. From 2013-2015, 122 centers -- about 20 percent of all facilities -- were reported to the authorities for hiring unqualified nurses, while 113 facilities faced disciplinary measures for not educating their staff on infectious disease control and prevention as required. Also, the number of complaints filed to the Korea Consumer Agency by those who stayed in postpartum care facilities also rose from 510 in 2010 to 1,200 last year. Some of the complaints were about unsanitary kitchen and poorly cooked meals. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is testing the 120 babies who stayed at Seoul\u2019s Eunpyeong district-based center for possible infection. According to the parents who filed the damage suit, 26 babies out of 46 who have been tested turned out to be latent TB-positive.This means the TB bacteria is in the children\u2019s bodies but inactive and therefore causing no symptoms. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of infected persons with latent tuberculosis (LTB) develop TB disease at some time in their lives.Choi Myung-joo, one of the parents who are suing the center, claimed that the infected babies are now required to take Rifampicin, also known as Rifampin, an antibiotic to treat LTB for a maximum of nine months. All tuberculosis medications, including Rifampin, can be highly toxic to the liver, especially of children. \u201cA lot of the infected children are less than 100 days old,\u201d she wrote in her open letter to Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the NPAD. \u201cIt breaks our heart to see our babies having to take such strong medicine every morning at such a young age.\u201d Some of the infants reportedly have been showing symptoms of side effects of the drug, including vomiting and sleeping too much. Worried about the possible liver damage, a number of mothers chose not to have their children take the medicine and wait until they are older to start the preventive TB treatment.Despite such increasing health scares at postpartum centers, they are considered efficient in helping new mothers recuperate and learn child care tips.Traditionally for Korean mothers, the first three weeks after birth have been strongly emphasized in postnatal care. Some of the traditional customs still being practiced to this day -- now mostly at postpartum care centers -- include eating seaweed soup and keeping their bodies warm by wearing long sleeves even in the summer season. One of the traditional Korean health beliefs is that if a woman does not stay warm after the delivery, her joints will ache when she gets older along with other health problems.Before the emergence of postpartum care facilities in the late 1990s, the care was usually provided by the mothers\u2019 family members -- usually the maternal grandmother of the newborn -- at home. Today, the centers are considered useful especially among women whose mothers are not available to help with their postpartum care or those who don\u2019t want to burden their parents after the delivery. The fees for the centers, however, differ dramatically according to regions. According to Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition NPAD, the most expensive facility was located in Seoul\u2019s glitzy Gangnam district, which charged 20 million won ($17,046) for two weeks\u2019 worth of service, while the cheapest center was in Gimje, North Jeolla Province, which charged 550,000 won for the same period. The most expensive facilities, mostly located in southern Seoul, are known to serve meals prescribed by nutritionists and made with only organic ingredients, while offering rooms that resemble five-star hotel suites. \u201cI think postpartum care is a necessity than a luxury for most moms,\u201d said Kim Yeon-soo, a mother of a 2-year-old. \u201cA lot of people I know have no choice but to go to these centers because they have no family to look after them and their babies after delivery. I don\u2019t think every woman needs a center that\u2019s like a five-star hotel. But every women should have an access to at least clean and safe centers if they really need to utilize the service.\u201dSeongnam City located South of Seoul, has been pushing to introduce fully-subsidized postpartum facilities as part of the efforts to increase low birthrate. However, the Health and Welfare Ministry disallowed the plan and urged the city reconsider it for infection and safety concerns.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","589":"North Korea and China launched a border trade zone on Thursday, as they kicked off their annual trade fair in the Chinese border city of Dandong.\u00a0\u00a0The Guomenwan trade zone in Dandong, where more than 70 percent of bilateral trade between the two nations is conducted, is the latest sign that North Korea and China are trying to boost economic cooperation, despite the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons.\u00a0\u00a0The launch of the trade zone fell on the first day of a four-day North Korea-China trade fair in Dandong, with Pyongyang reportedly sending a 400-strong delegation to the exhibition. \u00a0\u00a0Dandong Mayor Shi Jian told a launching ceremony that the establishment of the trade zone is \"significantly meaningful\" for the development of friendly relations between North Korea and China. \u00a0\u00a0Shi said the trade zone would help Dandong become a centerpiece of bilateral trade between North Korea and China, as well as logistics trade in Northeast Asia.\u00a0\u00a0Dandong officials said the trade zone will house as many as 50 North Korean business entities by April next year.

(Yonhap)","594":"BEIJING (AP) -- A top Chinese general said Saturday that China's newly created islands in the disputed South China Sea are intended mainly to aid shipping and dismissed concerns that Beijing is seeking to strengthen its control over the strategically vital region. General Fan Changlong's remarks came as expectations grow that the U.S. might directly challenge Chinese claims in the South China Sea by sailing a Navy ship inside the 12-nautical mile (21-kilometer) territorial limit surrounding one of the man-made islands. Concerns have been growing over the rapid appearance of islands created by piling sand atop reefs and atolls controlled by China, which is now adding harbors, air strips and large buildings. The U.S. and others have called on Beijing to halt those projects, saying they are destabilizing an increasingly militarized region. Fan said concerns that the island construction could affect freedom of navigation were unfounded. ``In fact, those construction projects are mainly carried out for civil purposes,'' Fan told the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing. ``As we have promised, the projects will not affect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Instead, they will enable us to provide better public services to aid navigation and production in the South China Sea.''\u00a0 China's assurances have failed to gain much traction abroad, and speaking shortly after Fan, Admiral Gary Roughead, the former U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, said the rapid expansion of the islands and a lack of clarity from Beijing ``heightens suspicions and presents the potential for miscalculations.'' While Beijing's assurances are welcomed, confidence measures and increased transparency are needed to assuage China's neighbors of its peaceful intent, Roughead said. Fan cited the recent launch of operations by two new lighthouses on Chinese island holdings as evidence of good intentions and said Beijing was committed to resolving disputes peacefully.\u00a0 ``We will never recklessly resort to the use of force, even on issues bearing upon sovereignty, and have done our utmost to avoid unexpected conflicts, said the general, a vice chairman of the powerful commission controlling the military that is headed by President Xi Jinping. Fan also said China would accelerate the establishment of an 8,000-member stand-by force for U.N. peacekeeping missions promised by Xi at the U.N. last month, as well as a commitment to train 2,000 foreign peacekeepers over the next five years. China will also pursue expanded military cooperation with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian States, whose defense ministers it hosted at a forum in Beijing on Friday. That includes exploring the possibility of establishing hotlines and exchanging liaison officers between their militaries, Fan said. The ASEAN meeting and Xiangshan Forum are part of an effort by China's military to burnish its reputation in a region wary of Beijing's territorial ambitions. Four of the ASEAN countries have claims to seas and islands in the South China Sea that clash with Beijing's own.Unnamed Pentagon officials said last week that the U.S. Navy may soon receive approval to sail a ship inside the 12-nautical mile (21-kilometer) territorial limit surrounding China's man-made islands, reported the Navy Times, which is closely affiliated with the U.S. Navy.ASEAN member Philippines on Wednesday gave strong backing for such a move. Sailing within the boundary would mark the first time the U.S. has directly challenged China's territorial claims since 2012 and reinforce Washington's assertion that land reclamation does not add sovereign territory. China has also sparred with Vietnam, another ASEAN member, over ownership of the Paracel island group, leading to a confrontation last year when Beijing moved a massive oil drilling platform into contested waters. On Thursday, Vietnam accused China of sinking one of its fishing boats near the disputed islands. The incident was apparently motivated by a desire to steal the ship's catch of fish and put it out of commission. There was no evidence that any Chinese government ships were involved, although Beijing's aggressive actions are believed to embolden Chinese fishermen in the area. China's military, especially its navy, is gathering formidable capabilities, fueled by large annual increases in the military budget, which is now the world's largest behind the U.S. China is adding new ships and submarines at a rapid pace, and its first aircraft carrier will soon become operational. Meanwhile, a massive military parade in Beijing last month showcased new missiles permitting China to hit targets _ including U.S. Navy ships and bases _ throughout the region. Along with claiming almost all of the South China Sea's island groups and crucial sea lanes, China is dueling with Japan over ownership of an uninhabited chain of islands north of Taiwan, and in late 2013 declared an air defense zone that would theoretically give it control of aviation over much of the East China Sea. Many analysts believe China is now considering declaring a similar zone over the South China Sea.","595":"South Korea and the United States will hold their annual senior-level defense talks next week to discuss joint deterrence against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats and alliance issues, the Defense Ministry said Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0Yoo Jeh-seung, deputy minister for policy at the Ministry of National Defense, will lead South Korea's delegation to the Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue to be held in Seoul from Sept. 23-24, according to the ministry.\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. will be represented by Abraham Denmark, deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, and Elaine Bunn, deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy.\u00a0\u00a0Main agenda items include the coordination of ways to deter and respond to the North's possible nuclear and missile provocations, it said.\u00a0\u00a0Also high on agenda will be the agreed transfer of the wartime operational control of South Korean forces. \u00a0\u00a0In November, the countries agreed to delay the U.S.-held wartime OPCON transfer to South Korea until the Northeast Asian country is capable of countering North Korean threats, with the mid-2020s tentatively set for the transition. \u00a0\u00a0KIDD was launched in 2011 on top of the annual defense ministers' talks, the Security Consultative Meeting, aimed at discussing security and defense policies. (Yonhap)","596":"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned Wednesday that North Korea will face \"severe consequences\" if it forges ahead with irresponsible provocations, a day after Pyongyang apparently threatened a nuclear test.\"There will be severe consequences as we go forward if North Korea does not refrain from its irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional concerns, make the region less safe, and if it refuses to live up to its international obligations,\" Kerry said.\"Our position is clear: We will not accept a DPRK -- North Korea -- as a nuclear weapons state, just as we said that about Iran,\" he told reporters after talks with South African Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane at the State Department.Kerry issued the warning a day after North Korea declared that its bomb-making nuclear facilities at the Yongbyon complex have returned to normal operation and apparently threatened to conduct its fourth nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch.Asked what \"severe consequences\" would be, Kerry said China has taken \"serious steps\" to pressure the North last year and the U.S. is encouraging Beijing to do more.\"There is a process by which additional pressure is being applied to the North. And obviously, I think we've already had discussions about the potential of what may have to now be done, if indeed the DPRK's media reports and others prove to be true regarding their nuclear facilities at Yongbyon and the plutonium production reactor facility also near Yongbyon,\" Kerry said.Kerry also said the U.S. and its partners in six-party talks will \"continue to put pressure on North Korea in order to get them to come to a place where they understand that their people and their country can never move forward until they have lived up to their international obligations.\"Kerry said economic sanctions alone may not be enough as the North is already impoverished and isolated. \"It may take more than sanctions with respect to North Korea because of its almost total absence of a legitimate economy, but nevertheless, we are talking with China, we are talking with Russia, we are talking with our friends in South Korea and Japan and elsewhere about how to proceed forward in a way that can find a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to North Korea's violation of all of the U.N. Security Council resolutions,\" he said.Kerry also said he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the issue when they spoke by phone Tuesday.\"I can assure you that all of these countries remain fixated on the need for North Korea to denuclearize with respect to its weapons program and to live up to its international obligations.And we will continue to calibrate, as we did with Iran by the way, the increase of particular choices that are available to us in an effort to get back to talks,\" he said. (Yonhap)","597":"North Korea will face additional U.N. Security Council sanctions further deepening its isolation if the regime forges ahead with a banned long-range rocket launch, South Korea's chief nuclear envoy said Wednesday.Special representative Hwang Joon-kook made the remark after talks with his U.S. counterpart, Amb. Sung Kim, in Washington, stressing that a satellite launch by the North, unlike those by other nations, constitutes a clear violation of U.N. resolutions.\"The right to peaceful use of space, which is possessed by ordinary nations, is clearly restricted in the case of North Korea under Security Council resolutions. In other words, North Korea's satellite launch is considered a test aimed at advancing its nuclear weapon delivery capabilities,\" Hwang told reporters.\"Should North Korea push ahead with the so-called satellite launch, it will bring about additional measures by the Security Council and would be putting itself in deeper isolation,\" he said.On Monday, the North strongly hinted at the possibility of launching a long-range rocket around the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Worker' Party, saying its scientists are working hard to mark the anniversary with greater achievements than the country's successful 2012 satellite launch.Arguing it has the right to the peaceful use of space, it also vowed to keep launching satellites.The missile threat was followed a day later by a nuclear threat. The North said Tuesday that its bomb-making nuclear facilities at the Yongbyon complex have returned to normal operation and are ready to respond to U.S. \"hostile policy\" toward it with \"nuclear thunder,\" a term apparently referring to a nuclear test.Hwang said South Korea and the U.S. share \"deep concern\" about the possibility of the North's rocket launch, saying the communist nation \"has openly stated that it will possess missile capabilities to strike as far as the mainland U.S.\"\"Not only six-party countries, including South Korea and the U.S., but also the U.N. Security Council take this dangerous move by North Korea as a serious act of threatening peace,\" the envoy said. \"North Korea should remember that it is the only country subject to U.N. Security Council resolutions due to its development of weapons of mass destruction.\"Hwang also urged the North to return to the negotiating table, saying Seoul and Washington are ready to hold \"exploratory talks\"with Pyongyang without any conditions to test the North's commitment to denuclearization before formally restarting the six-party talks.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have warned earlier this year that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.

Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea. Then, the North could use the U.N. move as an excuse to scuttle the envisioned family reunions next month,\" he added.North Korea has claimed it has the right to conduct space research by test-firing what it calls satellites, but outside analysts view it as a cover for missile tests.The North's missile and nuclear programs have flared up tension on the peninsula amid worries that it may soon develop the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.South Korea's defense ministry said last week that North Korea appears almost finished with construction at its rocket launch facility in Dongchang-ri on its west coast border.In recent satellite imagery, a new 67-meter-tall gantry has been spotted on the site, which experts say can be used for the launch of long-range missiles twice the size of the 30-meter Unha-3 that was launched into orbit in December 2012.North Korea is under heavy sanctions by the United Nations Security Council for its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.The government warned Tuesday that the North's possible provocation would be a blatant violation of the UNSC resolutions, but it also remained cautious about whether the North will go ahead with a rocket launch.\"South Korea and the United States are closely collaborating to brace for every possibility, including North Korea's possible launch of a long-range missile,\" said a ranking official at the Unification Ministry, asking not to be named.He said the government will not make any prejudgment over whether the North will actually fire off a rocket or whether Pyongyang's possible move would mean a breakup of the two Koreas' recent landmark deal on easing military tensions.\"It is too early to prejudge the situation,\" the official said.The official also refrained from making comments on the relationship between the North's potential move and the family reunions slated for Oct. 20-26.The North has a track record of unilaterally delaying scheduled reunion events, including in September 2013. At that time, the reunions were pushed back to early 2014.\"I think that the North's announcement has set the stage for the two Koreas to hold high-level talks at an early date,\" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. \"South and North Korea should hold such talks as soon as possible to prevent the North from making provocations.\"The two Koreas reached a landmark agreement on Aug. 25 to defuse military tension and resume the family reunions. They agreed to hold high-level talks as soon as possible without specifying the timing.\"Seoul needs to first propose for the high-level talks this time to persuade the North not to make provocations,\" Jeong said.\"The South need to discuss ways to resume a now-suspended inter-Korean tour program at Mount Kumgang in the North.\"But some analysts said the North's late night announcement appeared to intend not to herald its rocket launch, but to gauge public opinions in the U.S. and China.\"Given Seoul's nuclear envoy is on a trip to the U.S. and the leaders from Washington and Beijing will hold a summit late this month, the North's move seemed to send a message calling for a turnaround in their policy toward North Korea,\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.

Security Council resolutions. It also stressed that any launch would be a \u201cgrave provocation and military threat.\u201dApparently to counter the international criticism, Pyongyang repeated its hitherto position that it has a \u201csovereign right for peaceful space development,\u201d and that it would launch a \u201csatellite,\u201d not a warhead.\u201cThe world will clearly see a series of satellites of (North) Korea soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea,\u201d the unnamed chief of Pyongyang\u2019s National Aerospace Development Administration, said in an interview with the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency.\u201cSpace development for peaceful purposes is a sovereign state\u2019s legitimate right recognized by international law and the Party and the people of the DPRK (North Korea) are fully determined to exercise this right no matter what others may say about it.\u201dThe administration\u2019s chief also said that the North is in the final stage of developing a new earth observation satellite for weather forecasts to \u201cactively\u201d contribute to the nation\u2019s economic development, and that it has made \u201cgreat strides\u201d in its research to develop geostationary satellites.\u00a0Expert analyses of satellite imagery have raised the possibility that the North could launch a rocket, as it has been carrying out construction work to improve facilities at the Dongchang-ri launch site in North Pyongan Province.Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said it has yet to detect any unusual North Korean movements that indicate clear preparations for a rocket launch in the near future.\u00a0\u201c(The launch of a long-range rocket) will be a military threat and a clear violation of the UNSC resolutions that ban any activities using ballistic missile capability,\u201d said ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok during a press briefing.\u201cWe are currently maintaining close cooperation with the U.S. to jointly detect any North Korean activities with regard to its possible long-range rocket launch.\u201dSeoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry warned that should the North launch a rocket, it would deal with the issue at the UNSC in a \u201cprompt and effective\u201d manner.The North\u2019s mention of a potential rocket launch came as the two Koreas were preparing for the reunions of separated families from Oct. 20-26 at Mount Geumgangsan for the first time since February 2014.On Tuesday, the two sides exchanged their lists of family members, a process to confirm the final lists of those who will attend the family reunions at the east coast mountain resort.Observers say that should the inter-Korean relations deteriorate due to a rocket launch around Oct. 10, the reunions could be delayed or canceled. The reunions, planned for Sept. 2013, were delayed just several days before the reunions, amid cross-border tensions.It is also expected to test Seoul\u2019s judgement call as it had pledged to halt propaganda broadcasts, strongly opposed by the North, unless any \u201cabnormal situation\u201d occurs in their landmark Aug. 25 agreement that quelled cross-border military tension this summer.Experts say that the communist regime might feel the increasing \u201ctechnological need\u201d to conduct a rocket test to further advance its missile technology, given that it has not carried out any long-range rocket test since December 2012.\u201cThe most crucial reason for the North to want to conduct a rocket test is its technological motive. As the North seeks to become a strong nation in terms of its rocket and nuclear weapons capabilities, additional tests are, obviously, necessary,\u201d said Kim Tae-woo, North Korea expert at Dongguk University.\u201cWe can also think about the domestic political purposes. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs to further tighten his grip on power \u2026 in other words, to consolidate his leadership authority and strengthen discipline among his people.\u201dCheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the think tank Sejong Institute, called on Seoul to make more active efforts to dissuade Pyongyang from a rocket launch that could escalate cross-border tensions and lead to stronger international sanctions that would cause the isolated regime to consider a fourth nuclear test.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","605":"The United States said Monday North Korea would be violating multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions if it forges ahead with its plans to launch a satellite using ballistic missile technology.State Department spokesman John Kirby made the remark after the North's space agency strongly suggested that the country may launch a satellite aboard a long-range rocket around next month's 70th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party.\"There are multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that require North Korea to suspend all activity related to their ballistic missile program, and establish a moratorium on missile launches, stop conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology and abandon its ballistic missile program in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner,\" Kirby said.\"So any satellite launch using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation\" of U.N. resolutions, he said.Speculation has persisted that the North could launch a long-range rocket to mark the anniversary after a recent upgrade enabled the launch site to handle bigger rockets. Monday's statement from the North's National Aerospace Development Administration was Pyongyang's first official acknowledgment of the possibility.\"The world will clearly see a series of satellites of (North) Korea soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea,\" the KCNA reported in an English statement, without elaborating.The North also claimed it has the right to launch rockets for peaceful purposes.Pyongyang has long been accused of using long-range rocket launches as a pretext for test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.The North is believed to have honed advanced ballistic missile technologies through a series of test launches, including a 2012 launch that succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit. That test is considered the most successful so far.The test also sparked fears that the North has moved closer to ultimately developing nuclear-tipped missiles that could potentially reach the United States mainland. The country has so far conducted three underground nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009 and 2013. (Yonhap)","606":"South Korea\u2019s demographic policies have failed to boost the nation\u2019s critically low fertility rate despite spending 81 trillion won ($69 billion) to implement the measures since 2006.According to Rep. Shim Jae-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party, the nation\u2019s fertility rate, which stands at 1.21 children per woman this year, in fact decreased from 2006 -- 1.25 children per woman. The number of newborns also dropped from 448,200 in 2006 to 435,300 this year, according to the lawmaker.The budget for the policies, however, increased significantly over the nine years. The government allocated 14.7 trillion won for its policies to encourage parents to have children this year, which is about seven times larger than the budget of 2.1 trillion won in 2006. The policies implemented since 2006 include child care allowance for all parents with young children up to age of 2 years, more after-school programs for children of double-income households, and encouraging employers to grant maternity leave for their female workers. Some experts have said that one of the biggest reasons behind the policy failure is the lack of programs for young, single Koreans who are forced to put off marriage and having children because of expensive housing and limited job security. Gender inequality in the nation\u2019s labor force has also been also pointed out. According to Rep. Min Hyun-joo of the ruling Saenuri Party, some 260,000 women were fired from their work while taking their maternity leave in the last five years.The government expects that the nation\u2019s military would be short of 84,000 soldiers by 2030, and the health care cost for the elderly would result in a deficit of 47.7 trillion won ($44 billion) in the national health insurance fund in the same year, if the current fertility rate continues.

(Yonhap)","610":"In 2007, an eight-minute video clip of Tyra Banks \u201cattacking\u201d a young Korean-American woman who underwent double-eyelid surgery went viral. In the still-available clip, Banks, an African-American TV personality, claims that the surgery that the 25-year-old Korean-American named Liz received was an attempt to \u201clook more Caucasian\u201d by Asian women. \u201cYou and I are the same,\u201d Banks tells Liz, pointing her own artificially straightened hair. Her voice is firm and even intimidating.\u201cI know I\u2019m not going to look white with a hair weave. But it\u2019s still one step closer to (looking white). And your eyelid is one step closer. Do you understand?\u201dAre women like Liz really trying to \u201clook white\u201d by undergoing the procedure that creates a permanent crease on upper eyelids without even realizing it?\u00a0In today\u2019s Korea, where 20 percent of the female population has had plastic surgery at least once in their lives, the public rarely associates its ever-booming cosmetic surgery industry with race or the nation\u2019s turbulent modern history. \u201cI would get serious complaints if I performed the procedure and the Korean patient gets a crease like the one of a Caucasian person. What people want is a natural crease that is suited to Asian faces,\u201d said Seoul-based plastic surgeon Na Min-hwa, who has been performing the procedure for the past 15 years. \u201cThe whole idea that undergoing this surgery is an attempt to look white is absurd.\u201dA number of studies, however, have suggested that the introduction of the double-eyelid surgery to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s was closely related to racism and the U.S. military agenda, and that legacy still carries a significance today.Most popular plastic surgery in the worldWith or without Tyra Banks\u2019 rant, the double-eyelid operation has evolved into an even more popular procedure in Asia and the rest of the world in recent years. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the procedure was the most-performed plastic surgery worldwide last year. Some 1.43 million individuals underwent the procedure, including Asian-Americans, accounting for 14.8 percent of all cosmetic surgery performed across the globe in 2014. South Korea, meanwhile, performed the fourth-most cosmetic surgical procedures in the world last year.Among the well-known Korean figures who have had the procedure are former President Roh Moo-hyun and veteran singer Patti Kim.The surgery was first developed and performed in Korea by Dr. D. Ralph Millard, an American military plastic surgeon who was stationed in the country during the Korean War (1950-53). Among the very first Koreans who received the particular procedure were Korean war brides who married American soldiers. It is estimated that 50 percent of Asians have naturally creased eyes. However, the preference for double eyelids among Asians today is not \u201cinherent, natural or random,\u201d according to scholar Taeyon Kim. \u201cThis preference has an historical development that is shaped by the motives of the American Cold War that produced the Asian as an ambivalent threat that needed to be contained and domesticated,\u201d Kim wrote in her 2005 Ph.D. dissertation submitted to Bowling Green State University. 'Superior palpebral fold'Although it is believed that double eyelid surgery was first introduced in late 19th-century Japan, it was during the Korean War that the operation became popular in Asia, according to Kim\u2019s research. According to Kim, Millard was stationed in Korea during the war as part of an American public relations campaign to show \u201cAmerican\u2019s benevolent face to the Koreans.\u201d On top of developing and performing double eyelid surgery \u2015 which was the alteration of \u201cOriental\u201d features to \u201cOccidental\u201d \u2015 he was also committed to serving those who were severely injured on the battlefield and in need of surgical reconstruction. During the war, Korean eyes without the crease \u2015 referred to as the superior palpebral fold in American medical texts \u2015 were dubbed \u201cslanted,\u201d and were seen as a mark of inscrutability and deviance. In her text, Kim argued that it was significant that Millard, who is one of the pioneers of Asian double eyelid surgery, was a military surgeon whose experience of Asian bodies was firmly rooted in Cold War ideologies and discourses. \u201cSurgically altering the \u2018slanted\u2019 eyes became a mark of a \u2018good\u2019 and trustworthy Asian, one whose modification of the face provided a comforting illustration of the pliable Asian, and served as evidence of the U.S. as the model and Asia as the mimic,\u201d Kim wrote. The scholar pointed out that the legacy of such notions can be found even in the popular advertisements in Korea in the 2000s. The perceived enlargement of the eyes by undergoing the procedure is described in ways that suggest a \u201cbroadening of the mind, a brightening of the soul, and confidence in the spirit\u201d in modern Korean ads, according to the scholar. In 1964, Millard wrote why the Koreans without the fold are problematic. \u201cThe absence of the palpebral fold produces a passive expression which seems to epitomize the stoical and unemotional manner of the oriental,\u201d he wrote. Korean military brides to AmericaAlthough the War Brides Act in 1945 enabled American soldiers stationed overseas to bring home wives of a different race, interracial marriages were illegal in parts of the U.S. until the early 1960s. In such a political climate, Korean military brides were considered both cultural and racial threats to the U.S., which influenced many Korean women, especially those who wished to marry American soldiers, to alter their eyes in the 1950s.\u201cIt is felt that this deorientalizing problem may well come home to the American plastic surgeon, for there have been well over 10,000 Japanese war brides as well as many post-war marriages with Korean girls,\u201d wrote the American surgeon Millard in 1955.According to Yuh Ji-yeon\u2019s 2002 study on Korean military brides, the women who were brought to American families at the time were strictly pressured to nurture their children as future Americans and provide their husbands with an American lifestyle: \u201cTheir fear was that, unless properly Americanized, the women would \u2018foreignize\u2019 their husbands and children.\u201dDavid Palumbo-Liu\u2019s book, \u201cAsian American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier\u201d talks about how cosmetic surgery reduced such American anxieties by demonstrating the \u201cshaping power of the U.S.\u201d and the \u201cmalleability of Asia.\u201d By altering their eyes, the Korean brides became less threatening racially, while their \u201cpassive, compliant\u201d nature would make them easily assimilate, according to the studies. \u201cWhile it is primarily beauty that motivates (today\u2019s women\u2019s) desire to alter their eyes, this beauty is built on a legacy of a history of Western science and race that privileged the white body as the normal, beautiful body,\u201d Kim wrote in her study.Unconscious legacy Song Ji-hye, a Seoul native, underwent double eyelid surgery in 2005, at age of 19. The 29-year-old said she just wanted to have a more \u201cdefined look,\u201d and had no desire to look white.\u201cI\u2019ve never had anyone asking me if I underwent the surgery in order to look more white,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone who underwent the procedure for that reason, either. It sounds absurd to me. Caucasians are not the only racial group of people who have double eyelids. If anything, I think those who undergo the procedure want to look like fellow Asians who have naturally creased eyes.\u201dCulture critic Lee Moon-won said most Koreans are unconscious of the Western influence on the country\u2019s beauty standards, partly because they are not often exposed to ethnic or racial diversity. \u201cMost people don\u2019t think they want to look white, and that may be true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you think about it, what the society collectively considers as beautiful \u2015 big eyes, a small face, and perked nose \u2015 are things that many Koreans can\u2019t achieve naturally. The (Western) influence is there, but people don\u2019t question it because the society has very narrowly defined notions of beauty. When everyone wants to look the same way, you think that\u2019s the normal way regardless of its history or meaning.\u201dMillard in 1955 predicted that the double-eyelid surgery would be useful in the U.S. to assimilate the children of military brides from Asia. \u201cEspecially in the products of the second generation, the plastic surgeon may be called upon to help them blend with their surroundings,\u201d he wrote.Some 60 years have passed, and South Korea has evolved into the world\u2019s plastic surgery-capital. A total of 440,582 surgical operations were performed in Korea last year alone, accounting for 4.6 percent of all procedures performed in the world. Double-eyelid surgery is one of the most common procedures being performed here. In the U.S., plastic surgery is on the rise among Asian-Americans overall, with 44 percent of them opting to receive double-eyelid surgery. And women continue to be shamed in both countries. Song Ji-hye was once called a \u201cseonggwei,\u201d meaning \u201cplastic surgery monster\u201d by a male colleague at a drinking party.\u201cYou get shamed no matter what,\u201d Song said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get it, you are made fun of your looks, and once you get the procedure, you are shamed for having done it or not being naturally beautiful. I think it\u2019s better to at least look good if you are going to be shamed anyway.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","611":"A grenade exploded at an Army recruit training center in Daegu on Friday, killing one instructor and injuring two other soldiers, military officials said. The incident took place at 11:08 a.m. as a 20-year-old trainee, identified only by his surname Sohn, was preparing to throw a K413 hand grenade right after removing its safety hook. A 27-year-old sergeant surnamed Kim who was giving guidelines in the same trench was immediately hospitalized to treat shrapnel wounds all over his body but died at 12:53 p.m., officials said. The blast also severed Sohn\u2019s right wrist. He underwent surgery at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Another 27-year-old sergeant surnamed Park, who was about 1 meter away from the recruit, also suffered injuries to his left leg, said Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo, head of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u201cThe grenade detonated in the trainee\u2019s hand just when he was about to hurl it,\u201d Koo said during a parliamentary audit later in the day.\u00a0Police enter\u00a0an Army\u00a0training center in Daegu where a grenade blast killed one instructor and injured two soldiers on Friday. (Yonhap)Some other 200 soldiers were at the site for their fourth week of training, but no one else was hurt, he noted. The military has launched an investigation to examine if the device was faulty and how the incident happened. The K413 is an upgrade to the Korean-made K400 fragmentation grenade, which went off at a boot camp last September in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, killing three. Yet the new model showed poor performance during a regular ammunition test conducted in April 2014 by the Army as six out of 30 units exploded before the three-second threshold, according to Rep. Kim Kwang-jin of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, citing documents submitted by the Army and the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality. Though the DTaQ determined that the premature blast resulted from manufacturing defects after a seven-month-long analysis, the military recalled only 60,000 units produced in 2011. About 1 million K413s have been delivered since 2010, with the current inventory standing at around 250,000, the lawmaker said. \u201cGiven the discovery of the flaws, the military should halt the use of the grenade and consider retracting all existing ones at least until the exact cause of the incident comes to light,\u201d Kim said. The explosion in Daegu is the latest in a string of military accidents involving firearms, land mines and other weapons. In November 2008, a blast occurred within a guard post in Cheorwon County, Gyeonggi Province, after a private broke the return rule and threw a grenade in a barrack where 16 other servicemen were asleep. The incident wounded five.

This means whoever is in charge of the household finances must work more than 12 hours daily, if he or she is allowed to work five days a week.The report, published by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, showed that such long work hours make it impossible for income earners of such households to balance work and life. In most countries, those who make less than 50 percent of the national median income are considered as living below poverty line. Korea has one of the lowest minimum wages among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries -- currently standing at 5,580 won ($4.86) an hour . In 2013, Korea\u2019s minimum wage only accounted for 44 percent of the national median wage. South Korea belongs to the most corrupt 20 percent of the 30 advanced countries, with a poverty rate of 14.6 percent. (Yonhap)Among the OECD countries, Korea had the 11th longest work hours required for single-income households earning minimum wage with two children in order to beat poverty. Countries such as Australia and Iceland only required such households to work less than 20 hours a week to live above their poverty line. \u201cIf it is nearly impossible to live above the poverty line without enduring such long work hours, it\u2019s hard to say the current minimum wage system is benefiting Korea\u2019s low-income earners,\u201d the report said.Last month, a report released by the World Economic Forum showed that Korea\u2019s economic rents are highly concentrated in a few large family-run conglomerates while its national income distribution appears to be significantly unequal.

(Yonhap)","618":"Opposition lawmakers Thursday blasted the education minister at the parliamentary audit for not providing sufficient information on its supposed drive to reinstate state-published textbooks for secondary education.Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, who has stated that students needed to learn from \u201cone version of history,\u201d said that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to say where the ministry stands on the issue as he has not been briefed by the National Institute of Korean History on the matter. The NIKH is slated to hold a public hearing Friday.There has been a debate in South Korea over whether the government should be given exclusive right to publish history textbooks for middle and high schools. Rival parties have been wrangling over the issue for months while high-ranking education officials and progressives across the country have raised objections to the prospect. The country currently allows publishers to write their own secondary education textbooks, but some of these books are accused of being substandard. Elementary school-level history textbooks are already published by the state.\u201cThe issue of state history textbooks can be confirmed after a series of procedure following the public hearing (by the NIKH). It is not right for me to preemptively tell you the conclusions,\u201d Hwang said at the audit held in Sejong Government Complex.Hwang did reiterate his stance that having a single version of history taught in schools can help students avoid confusion, and that he \u201cdid not rule out\u201d state-published history textbooks. But opposition members said that it was very unlikely that the ministry was oblivious to the prospect of a new textbook publishing system, given that Hwang vowed to announce the ministry\u2019s position in late September and the procedure to develop the new textbook would begin around October.\u201cYour schedule implies that the administrative notification for the new textbooks should start soon. The ministry should at the very least announce which direction it is headed in,\u201d said Rep. Youn Kwan-suk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Earlier in the day, Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD revealed an official document created by the Education Ministry which showed that \u201cimprovement of the history textbook system\u201d was a presidential directive. The document was dated February 2014, which was around the time that a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co. was accused of conservative bias and a general lack of quality.NPAD\u2019s Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon accused the ministry of sabotaging the audit, and urged the ministry to provide all related data on the suspicion that Park had directly ordered the reinstatement of state history textbooks, which were initially introduced by her father, former President Park Chung-hee before being abolished in the 2000s.While Hwang claimed that opinions of \u201cvarious experts related to history\u201d were taken into account in the ministry\u2019s decision, he did not elaborate on exactly who participated in the procedure. Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition party pointed out that the latest survey results stated by the ministry -- which showed that 48.6 percent of the people were for state textbooks opposed to 48.1 percent against -- was dated October 2014. He asked Hwang to provide results of more recent surveys and a list of those who participated in the public hearing and research. Members of the ruling Saenuri Party, on the other hand, said that textbooks published under the current system have many errors.Rep. Kang Eun-hee of Saenuri pointed out that eight high school history textbooks that currently exist are inconsistent on facts. When describing the dawn of the Stone Age on the Korean peninsula for example, the textbooks range from B.C. 300,000 to B.C. 1 million. She also pointed out that the textbooks have different interpretations about the Vietnam War, Korea\u2019s modern history and the country\u2019s first president, Rhee Syng-man.\u201cBecause the standards for (the ministry\u2019s) certification are low, publishers are basically left to freely author textbooks,\u201d she said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","619":"North Korea has been invited to send a taekwondo demonstration team to Seoul next month, the sport's top official said Thursday, as negotiations between the two Koreas for sports exchanges gain momentum.The Seoul-based World Taekwondo Federation sent the invitation to the Pyongyang-led International Taekwondo Federation last Friday and is awaiting a response, Choue Chung-won, president of WTF told Yonhap News Agency.This is the second time Choue has invited the ITF. He wrote a similar letter to Chang Ung, the then-ITF president, in July.\"Hopefully, the collaboration between the WTF and ITF sets an example for inter-Korean sports exchange,\" Choue said.North Korea had hinted at its willingness to send a demonstration team to the 2017 World Taekwondo Championships in South Korea, according to a recent Voice of America interview with Ri Yong-son, the newly elected head of ITF.\"We have been always ready. If the WTF sends us an invitation, we will send a team. We can also host their team. We will cooperate with each other,\" Ri was quoted as saying.If the ITF accepts the offer, Choue said he will set up a working-level meeting between the two parties at a third-party country later this month.Choue said he recently met with Chang, who currently represents North Korea at the International Olympic Committee, in Lausanne, Switzerland, and confirmed their commitment to facilitating further exchange in the Korean traditional martial art.\u00a0 South Korea first sent a demonstration team to the North in September 2002. A month later, Pyongyang sent its own down south.In 2007, an ITF demonstration team performed in Seoul and the South Korean city of Chuncheon to congratulate the WTF's opening in South Korea.There has yet to be a team exchange between the WTF and ITF, however.

The annual questioning will be run separately from Thursday to Sept. 23 and from Oct. 1 to Oct. 8.Lotte had been embroiled in a bitter family fight over control of the sprawling business empire, which has reignited sentiment against family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol, and prompted an all-out government investigation into the group.In 2013, Shin was ordered to pay 10 million won ($8,870) in fines for refusing to comply with the call to appear at the annual audit held a year earlier, citing overseas business trips. (Yonhap)","621":"Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se struggled Thursday to assure opposition lawmakers that President Park Geun-hye's recent trip to China was fruitful in drumming up Beijing's support for Seoul's approach toward Pyongyang.In an annual parliamentary audit of the ministry's work, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy claimed the Park administration is overstating the results of her visit last week to attend China's World War II anniversary event.Rep. Won Hye-young asked the minister if Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in their summit to \"cooperate\" on the reunification of the two Koreas. He was citing an earlier government statement.Yun was equivocal.\"Discussions on unification, along with the North Korean nuclear issue, provocation, and peace issues, have been under way naturally on various levels, including the summit between the two sides, since (President Park's) state visit to China in 2013,\" he said. \"The unification matter is in the direction of being discussed in a natural and frank manner.\"Yun said it would be impossible to peacefully reunify the two Koreas without denuclearizing the North.He reaffirmed that the government is not seeking any absorption-based unification.Rep. Shin Kyoung-min of the NPAD also took issue with the government's own assessment of the outcome of the latest Park-Xi summit, saying it is \"filled with self-praise\" and diplomatic rhetoric despite no breakthrough in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.In fact, there is no difference from the results of their previous summit two years ago that called for the early resumption of the six-way nuclear talks and the North to refrain from taking provocative acts, he argued. In response, Yun simply said the government's statement on the summit \"considerably reflects the actual content and mood of the summit talks.\"Defending Yun from the opposition party's criticism, Rep. Won Yoo-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party said the president bore a lot of fruits through her talks with Xi, including a deal to continue dialogue and cooperation on political, military, economic and security issues.Rep. Lee Ju-young of the ruling party pointed out that Park's decision itself to attend a massive military parade in Beijing drew largely positive public feedback. Many say it has paved the way for South Korea to balance its ties with China and its alliance with the United States. A number of media outlets agreed that Seoul's diplomacy on regional powers has entered a new path.\"Nonetheless, we need to continue diplomatic efforts in a calm way, bearing in mind that diplomatic accomplishments tend to come out gradually, rather than immediately, after any summit talks,\" Lee said.Rep. Choi Jae-cheon of the opposition NPAD questioned China's role in bringing lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula.He recalled a 2013 opinion poll by a local private think tank showing 25 percent of Koreans view China as the biggest obstacle to unification, while only 19.1 percent picked North Korea.\"We should be very prudent and strategic in treating China as a cooperation partner for peaceful unification,\" Choi said. \"In particular, China is a signatory to the Armistice Agreement.\"The minister said China is expected to play a \"constructive role\" in promoting peace on the peninsula.South Korea is leaving the door open for consultations with China and other relevant nations on the issue of eventually replacing the 1953 armistice with a peace treaty, Yun said, adding that there should first be some progress in denuclearization efforts. (Yonhap)","622":"U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump said Wednesday he is against a deal with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for 2014 for the upkeep of the U.S. troops, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Trump has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination for next year's election as he made a series of unbridled remarks on immigration and other sensitive issues that apparently struck a chord with conservatives. (Yonhap)","623":"President Park Geun-hye's attendance at last week's Chinese military parade will turn out to be useful in blunting Beijing's opposition to the possible deployment of a U.S. THAAD missile defense battery to South Korea, a former South Korean foreign minister said Wednesday.Park's presence at the muscle-flexing parade, which was shunned by Western leaders, led to some U.S. experts and observers raising questions about whether Seoul is tilting too much toward Beijing at a time of growing rivalry between the U.S. and China.But former South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-joo said that South Korea must have decided on the attendance after close consultations with the U.S., and that the decision could after all prove to be helpful for the possible deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea.\"If and when South Korea decides to have the THAAD missile deployed in Korea, Park's September visit to Beijing will prove to be quite useful for persuading Chinese leaders that Korea intends no harms to China,\" Han said during a forum at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The U.S. hopes to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea to better cope with North Korean missile threats, but China has openly raised strong objections, claiming the system could be used against it, despite repeated assurances from Washington that it won't pose any threats to the country.South Korea said it decided to attend the ceremony as it needs Chinese cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear standoff and realizing unification of the divided peninsula. Beijing is considered the only country in the world that has any meaningful influence over the regime in Pyongyang.\"South Korea believes that the best way to maintain peace, harmony and cooperation in the region is to pursue common ground and interests, rather than confrontation and harsh rhetoric,\" Han said.\"As China's power increases, South Korea's dilemma between Washington and Beijing is likely to deepen but it is hoped that through consistent dialogue and greater efforts to understand each other's position the ROK-US alliance will overcome any major challenges,\" he said.Touching on last month's military standoff between the two Koreas, Han said the crisis had a \"silver lining\" as it not only reminded South Koreans of the importance of the alliance with the U.S., but also led to a breakthrough in the long-stalled relations between the two Koreas.The standoff was also useful in that the South and the U.S. obtained some information on North Korea's war plans and capabilities exposed in the course of escalating tensions, Han said. Such information will facilitate the upgrading of the allies' joint contingency plan, he said.Han said he sees hope that the strained relationship between South Korea and Japan has now \"reached the bottom ebb and may start improving\" after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a war anniversary statement last month and President Park acknowledged positive elements in the statement.\"The situation both requires and permits Korean leaders to be more courageous and broad-minded and to have a more magnanimous frame of mind in dealing with the past as well as pursuing future relations,\" Han said. \"Japanese leaders need to undertake a more sincere and deeper reflection of the past and act on the basis of what is really in the best interest of Japan's present and future,\" he said.

The other ministers were from the U.S., Finland and Indonesia. The event, attended by public health authorities from 47 countries as well as the World Health Organization, was held about a month after Korea announced the de facto end to its Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. The health crisis claimed 36 lives here.\u00a0The announcement of the action packages came a day after Korean President Park Geun-hye shared her plans to spend $100 million to support 13 developing countries to fight infectious disease in the next five years. South Korean Health Minister Chung Chin-youb (second from left) speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap\u201cRecent global outbreaks have enlightened the world that infectious diseases are not solely a public health problem of developing countries,\u201d the announcement of the action packages, officially titled the Seoul Declaration, said.\u201cRather, public health crisis can have serious social, economic, and political implications on a national, regional and international scale. Therefore, global health security should be understood as a shared, multisectoral responsibility that no single country, organization or sector can achieve alone in every area of our lives.\u201d The 11 action package targets include antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic disease, biosafety and biosecurity, immunization, a national laboratory system, real-time surveillance, reporting, workforce development, emergency operations centers, linking public health law and multisectoral rapid response and medical countermeasures and personnel deployment.Upon the release of the declaration, each and every participating country vowed to eventually provide at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine to 95 percent of their 15-month-old population and establish a public health emergency operations center to better detect public health emergencies. Korea recently announced the formation of such an agency as the nation\u2019s post-MERS plan to better deal with infectious disease threats.The declaration also recommended the participating country have at least one trained field epidemiologist for every 200,000 people.The Korean government had been heavily criticized for its initial response to the MERS outbreak earlier this year, especially for refusing to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals for more than two weeks after the index case was confirmed in May. The Seoul Declaration required participating countries to adopt timely and accurate disease reporting according to WHO requirements.On Monday, Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed the importance of timely and transparent information release when dealing with health emergencies. \u201cThe CDC is one of the most trusted organizations in the country (the U.S.),\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because people know we are going to tell the truth even if it\u2019s going to make them feel uncomfortable. ...

He called for the unity of the party in order to win the general election next year and the presidential election in 2017.\u201cIf the reform proposal fails to pass, I will step down from the post of chairman,\u201d he said.\u201cBut if (the council) approves the proposal and renews confidence in my leadership, let us put an end to controversy over my position.\u201dNPAD chairman Moon Jae-in speaks at a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapMoon\u2019s abrupt decision came as he came under growing pressure to resign from members of the party who remain skeptical of the reform proposals.The proposals call for an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the next parliamentary elections in April. The panel also suggested offering extra points to fresh figures, women and the handicapped in the nomination process. Earlier in the day, a subcommittee at the New Politics Alliance for Democracy passed the proposal, but it has to get a final endorsement from the party\u2019s executive council. The council plans to put the proposal to vote next Wednesday.Moon putting his leadership on the line was seen as his last resort to put a break to intensifying factional feuds between pro-Roh Moo-hyun members, regarded as mainstreamers in the party, and nonmainstream members. \u201cRecent cases of (party members) publicly attempting to shake the party and divide the party have just crossed the line,\u201d he said, without mentioning names. \u201cTo save the party, tighten discipline and build principle, it is inevitable to call for a vote of confidence in my leadership.\u201dThe surprise press conference was also held a few hours after Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, a former joint party leader, met party defector Chun Jung-bae to discuss the future of the opposition party. Chun, who recently won a parliamentary seat in a by-election as an independent candidate, has reportedly asked Ahn to join a new party he plans to launch.\u00a0 Ahn on Sunday lashed out at the NPAD reform committee, saying its attempt to reform the party had failed and that he has different views from Rep.

In particular, it earmarked more than 3 trillion won to strengthen frontline defense around the Demilitarized Zone, marking an increase of 40.6 percent from the previous year. The money is to be spent on bolstering artillery detection radars, drone-based surveillance capabilities and striking assets such as K-9 self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers.The government hopes to spend 1.67 trillion won, an increase of 5.4 percent from a year ago, on antisubmarine capabilities. Last month, the North, in a \u201cquasi-state of war,\u201d mobilized a massive fleet of submarines, showing off its underwater warfare capabilities.Also noteworthy in the budget plan is a spike in the expenditure for constructing the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Kill Chain preemptive strike architecture that will form the basis of Seoul\u2019s capabilities to counter Pyongyang\u2019s missile and nuclear threats.For the KAMD and Kill Chain programs, Seoul set aside 1.5 trillion won, an increase of 64.5 percent from the previous year. \u201cWe increased the budget to speed up the construction of the Kill Chain and KAMD to respond to North Korea\u2019s asymmetric military threats and to bolster our defense of frontline outposts through enhancing key assets such as mid-range guided weapons,\u201d Baek said.To continue the efforts to lay the groundwork for peaceful unification, Seoul pledged to focus on the restoration of the Gyeongwon railroad which in the past ran from Seoul to North Korea\u2019s eastern city of Wonsan, and on the construction of the infrastructure for inter-Korean economic cooperation and exchanges.For the railroad project, Seoul set aside 150.8 billion won.

In-flight smoking was the most common violation, accounting for 80 percent. Most of them were caught while smoking in the restroom, the report said. By law, anyone smoking in the airplane can be fined up to 5 million won ($4,200). A total of 12 cases were related to affrays, while six other cases were sexual crimes, including sexually harassing flight attendants or masturbating in the seats. Meanwhile, another report by Rep.

The association, which was established in 1963, has given the award every year since 2002. Previous recipients included former U.S. Ambassadors to South Korea Donald Gregg and Kathleen Stephens and former U.S. Forces Korea commander Walter Sharp.Royce has long been a big supporter of South Korea as well as Korean Americans in the U.S.In particular, he's provided a key congressional voice in support of South Korea in the country's rows with Japan over the sovereignty of South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo and Japan's refusal to apologize for its wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.In an interview with Yonhap News Agency early this year, Royce said categorically that \"Dokdo\" is the proper name to refer to the East Sea islets, recognizing South Korea's sovereignty over the islets and rejecting Japan's claims. He has made similar remarks later.In 2007, he played a key role in the unanimous adoption of a House resolution calling for Japan to apologize for the sexual slavery issue. This year, he also issued a statement berating Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for failing to offer a clear apology for the atrocity.Royce has also worked hard for denuclearization of the North and improvement of the communist nation's human rights records.He's the author of legislation that calls for strengthening sanctions on Pyongyang.

(Yonhap)The talks at South Korea\u2019s Peace House in the border village of Panmunjeom came after they agreed last month to hold the reunions around Chuseok, a major Korean holiday that falls on Sept. 27, as part of a comprehensive deal to defuse military tensions.Lee Deok-haeng, an executive committee member of the South Korean Red Cross, led his three-member delegation, while the other side was represented by Park Yong-il, a senior member of the North Korean Red Cross.\u201cWe will do our best to live up to your expectations and hopes,\u201d Lee told the press before the talks began in the morning to determine the date, venue, scale and other details of the reunions that have not been held since February 2014 amid cross-border tensions.The South Korean side pushed to put a series of issues on the agenda, including exchanging lists of the surviving members of families divided after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, allowing the families to exchange letters and meet through video links and holding the reunions on a regular basis.Seoul has regarded the issue of the separated families as an urgent humanitarian one, a reason President Park Geun-hye proposed during her Aug. 15 Liberation Day speech that the two Koreas work together to identify those with loved ones across the border. Last Tuesday, the South\u2019s Red Cross began its survey of surviving members of the separated families. It presumes more than 66,000 people, including around 1,060 South Korean nationals living abroad, remain alive.Seoul apparently hoped to hold the reunions at Mount Geumgangsan before Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, around which time observers say the North could set off provocations to strengthen national unity and show off its military presence.As the Red Cross talks began, hopes rose that the talks would lead to more cross-border dialogue to help improve bilateral ties that have continued to deteriorate with Pyongyang\u2019s provocative acts and adherence to its nuclear program, and Seoul\u2019s harsh reactions to them.The meeting was the first since the Aug. 25 deal under which the two Koreas agreed to conduct a set of measures to reduce tensions and improve relations, including holding government-level talks and bolstering exchanges in various civil sectors. Calling for the withdrawal of U.S. forces in the South, Pyongyang\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Monday that the Aug. 25 deal showed the ability of the two Koreas to safeguard peace on the peninsula by themselves.\u201cWe will gravely hold the U.S. responsible should another armed clash take place again for no reason in the future due to the U.S. refusing to withdraw its forces and staging provocative military acts,\u201d said the North\u2019s ministry in a statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency.Meanwhile, Kim Gunn, director general for North Korean nuclear affairs at Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry, met with his visiting Chinese counterpart Xiao Qian to discuss an array of North Korea-related issues including the reclusive state\u2019s persistent pursuit of nuclear arms.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","634":"By Shin Hyon-heeThe Park Geun-hye government is pushing to bring in advanced, pricey military assets without a budget commensurate with the size of the projects, heaping a financial burden of billions of dollars onto its successor, a report said Monday.After analyzing 22 weapons acquisition programs each worth 500 billion won ($415 million) or more, Rep. Baek Kun-ki of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the incumbent administration is expected to spend some 13.6 trillion won for defense by the time its term ends in late 2017, whereas the next government would bear more than 24.8 trillion won by 2020.For instance, for a project to adopt four units of Airbus\u2019 in-flight refueling tankers by 2019, the Park government is supposed to fund almost 360 billion won and its successor around 1.8 trillion won, the report claimed. The National Defense Acquisition Program Committee announced the result of the bid in late June, and the France-headquartered company is slated to deliver two planes in 2018 and another two the following year.In another case, the government is set to pay the 376.9 billion won balance by 2018 for Surion initiative \u2015 the country\u2019s first indigenously developed military helicopter built by the Korea Aerospace Industries \u2015 though the delivery will be completed in 2017, the retired four-star Army general said.

By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","639":"In May, the discovery of a young woman\u2019s body packed into a suitcase buried under cement in the hills in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, left South Korea in shock and horror. The 26-year-old, surnamed Kim, was murdered by her 24-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly killed her while drunk after she tried to break up with him. The boyfriend, only identified by his surname Lee, impersonated Kim on social media for two weeks after killing her and disposing of her body.According to Rep. Jeong Yong-ki of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of murder cases among dating partners has been on the rise in Korea since 2012, from 99 to 108 last year. In the last three years, the number of victims like Kim totaled 313. A research also showed that 40 percent of the Korean women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. (123RF)The murder cases accounted for 11.9 percent of all crimes committed by the victims\u2019 romantic partners against them, including stalking, physical violence and rape. The rate is particularly high considering the total number of murder cases in Korea only accounted for 1.69 percent of all violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- in the same period.\u201cThis means two people are being killed by their romantic partners every week,\u201d Rep. Jeong said.According to Korea Women\u2019s Hotline, a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence, at least 114 Korean women were killed by either their husbands or boyfriends last year, while at least 95 women survived after being seriously attacked by their spouses or romantic partners. Almost 90 percent of women who participated in the NGO\u2019s research last year said they had been either physically or emotionally abused while dating or during courtship. From 2011 to 2013, some 20,500 individuals were arrested for dating violence. According to the police, Kim had also reportedly endured serious dating violence for about a year until she tried to end things with Lee. According to local news reports, Lee would often break into Kim\u2019s house without consent for \u201cnot picking up his calls\u201d and physically abuse her. Lee later confessed to the police that he killed Kim \u201cin a fit of rage\u201d when he learned that Kim wanted to break up with him. Kim and Lee had met as teacher and student at a private English institution in Busan, where Kim had been teaching upon returning to Korea after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany.Kim\u2019s story overlaps with experiences of many women who participated in researcher Lee Hwa-young\u2019s study for Korea Women\u2019s Hotline. Many suffered abuse, assault and rape when they tried to end the relationship.One of the victims had been dragged to a motel room against her will and raped there by her enraged boyfriend, right after she told him that she wanted to break up with him. Another victim had been guilt-tripped and emotionally abused after she tried to end things with her boyfriend. \u201cHe told me that I\u2019m being a terrible person (by trying to break up with him) to his mother as well, because he already told her that we are getting married and our breakup is going to hurt and disappoint her badly,\u201d the victim told researcher Lee in her study.Another victim was stunned by what a police officer told her after she reported her ex. She also had been stalked and physically abused by her ex after breaking up with him. The officer reportedly told her: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh when you broke up with him.\u201dAccording to Safe Harbors of the Finger Lakes, an American support organization for victims of violence, there are some characteristics that are common to abusers of dating violence. One of them has to do with gender role expectations. Many individuals who abuse their romantic partners tend to have certain ideas of how men and women should act, largely following the stereotypical ideas of male dominance and female passivity. The abusers also may have difficulty expressing feelings, abuse alcohol and be \u201cprotective of their romantic partners to the point of controlling that person,\u201d according to the organization. Local experts say that popular culture and sex education are some of the biggest -- and often negative -- influences in gender role expectations among Koreans, which sometimes cause problematic consequences in relationships.\u201cFor example, there are so many Korean TV dramas that show its male protagonist forcing a kiss onto his love interest, while the woman just docilely accepts it,\u201d researcher Lee from Korea Women\u2019s Hotline told The Korea Herald. \u201cMany men, especially teenagers, may think this is normal and acceptable behavior. It does not only apply to men. While men may think it\u2019s acceptable to kiss or touch someone against the person\u2019s will -- or it\u2019s not \u2018manly enough\u2019 or \u2018cool\u2019 to even ask the woman for consent -- young women may think they should just remain silent even if their dating partner does something they don\u2019t want or like, or keep their wants to themselves and wait until the man makes the move.\u201dMeanwhile, the Education Ministry\u2019s recently issued\u00a0-- and heavily criticized --\u00a0guidelines for sex education famously stated that \u201cdate rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want commensurate compensation from the woman.\u201d Lee\u2019s research also showed that 40 percent of the women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. The largest portion of them, 60 percent, said it was because the abuse was not \u201cserious enough\u201d to end the relationship. Rep. Jeong said the government needs to be more involved in combating dating and domestic violence. Introducing heavier penalties for stalking, which often leads to more serious forms of abuse, can be one of the ways to improve the situation, according to civic experts. In Korea, the heaviest penalty a stalker can face is a fine of 100,000 won ($83).Since 2012, two bills have been proposed to introduce heavier punishment for stalking, but are still pending at the National Assembly for approval.

Over the past week, the North has made a series of statements to deny its responsibility for the land mine provocation and downplay its expression of regret over the detonation in the Aug. 25 agreement.Hours after the agreement, Hwang Pyong-so, director of the North\u2019s military\u2019s General Political Bureau, argued that South Korea\u2019s claim about the mine blast was \u201cgroundless.\u201d Seoul did not respond to it, regarding it as part of the North\u2019s propaganda activities for the domestic audience.On Wednesday, the unnamed spokesperson of the North\u2019s National Defense Commission said that its expression of the regret in the bilateral agreement was not the North\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, but an expression to console the wounded South Korean troops. Despite the exchange of barbs, the inter-Korean relations are not going to further deteriorate, analysts said, noting that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs to improve cross-border relations to break his country\u2019s isolation and find a way to improve its economy.Meanwhile, Seoul is stepping up its diplomacy to strengthen coordination with the U.S. and China to address North Korea issues, a senior Seoul official told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.Seoul\u2019s top nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kook plans to visit the U.S. next week to meet with his U.S. counterpart Sung Kim.

Under SOFA, which governs the legal status of some 28,500 U.S. troops stationed across the southern part of the peninsula, South Korea can primarily invoke judicial power when a serviceman is implicated in crimes, except while on duty. But authorities here have frequently not exercised it, opting to hand over the cases to the U.S. The Lawyers for a Democratic Society, better known as Minbyun, raised a suit calling for the Justice Ministry to release all the cases since 2001 that the U.S. requested South Korea to transfer, as well as their results. The ministry has kept the data undisclosed, citing diplomatic relations. A lower administrative court decided in December that a revelation of the information is unlikely to infringe on critical national interests because it concerns \u201coperation and management of an existing system\u201d and many records and statistics are already available. Overturning the verdict, the Seoul High Court said there is a \u201cconsiderable\u201d possibility that the exposure of all demanded data will affect the relationship with Washington and harm national interests.

Han Sun-kyo of the Saenuri Party, the number of Chinese nationals obtaining Korean driver\u2019s licenses surged to about 4,700 last year, jumping by 30-fold in two years. The rate of car accidents involving foreigners also rose by 2.6 times to nearly 2,000, the report said.\u00a0 A driver\u2019s license test agency is crowded with driving test applicants in Gangnam, Seoul, on Aug. 17. (Yonhap)The surge was especially noticeable on Jejudo Island, where over 1,100 Chinese obtained driver\u2019s licenses in the first half of this year. In 2012, only two Chinese nationals acquired a license there.In the meantime, car accidents involving foreigners also increased in Jeju from six to 40 cases between 2012 and last year. \u201cOver 40 percent of last year\u2019s accidents involved Chinese visitors,\u201d Jeju police agency said.The quick and simple process of obtaining a driver\u2019s license in Korea contributed to the surge in numbers, officials said. As the Korean driver\u2019s license rules were eased in 2011, would-be drivers are able to obtain the license in 4-5 days by taking 10 hours of classes and passing a set of driving tests. The cost is also relatively cheap at around 500,000 won ($420). The Korean driver\u2019s license is as valid as Chinese ones as long as the drivers pass a simple written test back in China.In China, on the other hand, getting a driver\u2019s license takes at least several months, with the cost ranging from 5,000 yuan ($790) to 10,000 yuan. Han pointed out that the lax regulations on driver\u2019s licenses should be strengthened in order to prevent misuse and tighten road security.The visa-free entry policy for Chinese sightseers to Jejudo Island from 2008 has likely affected the number increase as well, the authorities said. Acknowledging the easy access of Korean driver\u2019s licenses, some Korean driving academies have offered driving lessons and courses in Chinese for the tourists. Some have even hired Chinese interpreters to better draw Chinese customers. As more Chinese nationals opted to acquire Korean licenses, Beijing has also taken issue, citing safety concerns.The Chinese government asked Seoul late last year to impose restrictions on Chinese visitors seeking driver\u2019s licenses. The Korean police, however, reportedly replied that there was no legal basis to do so. In June, Shanghai discretionally suspended accepting Korean driver\u2019s licenses for short-stay visitors.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","655":"The Unification Ministry said Monday that next week South and North Korea plan to discuss ways to hold reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0In a landmark deal, the two Koreas agreed last week to resume the much-anticipated reunions of separated families on the occasion of Korea's fall harvest holiday slated for September.

The training program was organized by Nutrition and Education International, a humanitarian nongovernmental organization based in Pasadena, California, that has produced beans in Afghanistan to relieve malnutrition problems.\u00a0Founded by entrepreneur Dr. Steven Kwon, a former Nestle employee, NEI has supplied protein-rich soybean milk and soy products to more than 1.7 million Afghan children and women since 2003.\u00a0 Members of Afghanistan\u2019s private sector delegation speak at a press conference at Hotel Shilla Stay in Seoul on Thursday. From left are CEO of Afghanistan Capital Market Ahmad Bassam, chairman of Economic Development Noorullah Delawari, presidential adviser on private sector development and food security Khan Jan Alokozai, and CEO of Nutrition and Education International Steven Kwon. NEINEI\u2019s mission is to eradicate malnutrition in Afghanistan by establishing a sustainable soybean industry that employs a full value chain of seed multiplication, cultivation, processing and market development. Last year, NEI made a commitment to produce 300,000 metric tons of soybeans for the next 10 years. \u201cThis trip was a good experience to learn about Korea\u2019s Saemaul Undong agricultural movement. We want to benefit from this development model by applying it to Afghanistan, which is in the same situation Korea was in after the war,\u201d Khan Jan Alokozai, the presidential adviser on private sector development and food security, said in a press conference in Seoul on Thursday. \u201cDue to 40 years of devastating war, everything was destroyed in our country and we do not have much infrastructure left.\u201dAlokozai noted that following the Taliban regime\u2019s demise, the international community, including the U.S. and Korea, provided relief of $800 million for rebuilding the education, health, transportation, construction and telecommunications sectors. However, daunting challenges remain in the fledgling nation\u2019s efforts to forge peace and order, as it aims to initiate nationwide development using foreign aid and investment, he added. Noorullah Delawari, chairman of Economic Development for Peace and former governor of the Afghanistan Central Bank, said his country has continued to build infrastructure and amend laws to ease investment in line with Afghanistan\u2019s five-year National Development Strategy. Afghanistan\u2019s per-capita income is under $700 and its economic growth rate is 1.4 percent a year. The country imports 96 percent of products and exports 4 percent. More than 85 percent of its 32 million people work in agriculture, with 60,000 in the soybean industry. The total government budget is $7 billion, of which more than half is allocated to internal security. Government revenue makes up $2 billion of the national budget, while foreign aid comprises $5 billion. Life expectancy is around 45 for both men and women. According to Alokozai, critical factors in the country\u2019s future lies in its relations with neighbors Pakistan, Iran and China, the security situation with respect to the Taliban and Haqqani terrorist groups and the U.S. and NATO\u2019s military commitment. He pointed out that Afghanistan presents untapped opportunities for investment in roads, rails, mining, oil and gas, energy pipelines, power plants, food processing and packaging, logistics facilities, housing and consumer products and services. The Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries, established 80 years ago, has offices in 25 provinces employing 85,000 people. It has joint chambers and business consuls in 14 major countries across the world. The Afghan Embassy, Korea\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the United Nations World Food Program provided additional support for the trip, and a second delegation, of agricultural workers, will visit Korea in September.

Data from 2012 on Austria, Canada, France, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and the United States was not available in the report.Even after expanding the scope to outside the OECD, only Lithuania \u2015 at 29.5 per 100,000 \u2015 had a higher rate of suicide than Korea.The suicide rate for Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy has been highest among all OECD countries every year since 2003 when 28.1 people per 100,000 took their own lives. The rate peaked in 2009 at 33.8. While the country\u2019s rate hovered around the OECD average up until 1995 \u2015 marking 12.7 \u2015 the figure jumped to 21.7 in 1998 when the country was hit hard by the Asia financial crisis. After Koreans, Hungarians were most likely to take their own lives \u2015 marking 22 per 100,000 \u2015 followed by Japan at 19.1.The sky-high suicide rate for Koreans was also apparent among students. Separate data revealed by Rep. Kang Eun-hee of Korea\u2019s Saenuri Party showed that 17 students had committed suicide due to stress from school grades as of Aug. 17, accounting for roughly 23 percent of 61 students who took their own lives during the same period this year. The number of suicides from academic-induced stress in the first semester of this year has already surpassed the nine from 2014. South Korean schools operate two semesters a year with the first one starting in March and the second in September.According to 2014 data by Statistics Korea, suicide was the No. 1 cause of death among people aged 10 to 39. While Koreans showed a relatively high tendency to take their lives, they were ranked near the bottom in various criteria in quality of life.According to Korea\u2019s 2015 edition of OECD\u2019s \u201cHow\u2019s Life?\u201d biennial report to provide a comprehensive picture of well-being among OECD countries, the country\u2019s health status, work-life balance and subjective assessment of well-being were ranked 33rd, 31st and 29th. Koreans\u2019 spending on health was also lower than the OECD average. The report showed that Koreans spent about 6.9 percent of their gross domestic product on health in 2012, well below the OECD average of 8.9 percent.Korea\u2019s health spending is also heavily dependent on the private sector: Public sources covered only 56 percent of the spending, compared to 73 percent for all OECD countries.

(Yonhap)","659":"The number of sex trade businesses caught by police in the past two years has nearly tripled, a report showed Friday, as authorities have led a crackdown against prostitution despite ongoing debate over whether to legalize the controversial industry. The overall number of businesses offering sex, gambling or similar services apprehended by police dropped to 48,121 last year from 51,652 in 2013 and 55,785 in 2012, the report submitted by the National Police Agency to New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. You Dae-woon showed.Of such businesses, more businesses were caught offering sex services, with the number rising to 8,952 cases last year from 4,553 in 2013 and 3,263 in 2012.It showed that while the number of such businesses identified by the police decreased by 13.7 percent, the number of sex trade businesses surged by nearly threefold.Other types of obscene businesses marked a decrease, including those operating on lewd or sexual services and gambling that dropped by 44.6 percent and 24.4 percent, respectively.While the overall number of obscene businesses has dropped consistently since 2012, some regions showed a surge over the two years, the report said.They included Seoul (up 33.1 percent), North Chungcheong Province (18.0 percent), Jeju (8.2 percent) and South Chungcheong Province (3.3 percent).By the number of sex trade instances alone, Jeju showed a tenfold increase from 10 cases in 2012 to 101 cases last year. The numbers increased in Daejeon as well from 21 to 128, and Daegu from 85 to 509.Police said the drastic surge in sex trade operations caught in Jeju stems from the increase in foreign tourism, and the rise in new forms of prostitution, such as via a clandestine mobile sex trading system.\u201cLast year\u2019s number showed a surge especially because we fortified the clampdown as one of the policy goals,\u201d an official said. \u201cThis year, we are concentrating on enterprise-level sex traders and other actions that promote prostitution,\u201d the official added.There have been rising calls for more sophisticated ways of catching sex traders as the sex industry was seen finding creative ways to avoid reinforced clampdowns.Another police report in May showed that more than 6,600 cases of prostitution were arranged on the new platforms last year, more than triple the number of cases they caught in 2010. The latest methods of sex trade include the usage of online chat rooms, social networking sites and smartphone applications, the police said. The debate on legalizing prostitution has heated up in South Korea as the Constitutional Court began reviewing the law that criminalizes the sex trade. The court held its first public hearing in April.The antiprostitution law was enacted in 2004 to protect human rights, partly prompted by a fire that killed 14 sex workers who were locked in a brothel in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, in 2002. The law stipulates that both purchasing and selling of sex carry a penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,560). It gives exemption to people forced into prostitution, leaving only voluntary sex workers -- many of whom oppose the law -- subject to the punishment.From news reports","660":"Relations between North Korea and China have changed markedly due to Pyongyang's refusal to denuclearize and repeated provocations, South Korea's top nuclear envoy said Friday.Hwang Joon-kook, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, cited China's attitude on the North in its recent military stand-off with the South.\"China won't side with North Korea over its provocative act,\" he said at a forum in Seoul to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 19 Joint Statement. Under the 2005 agreement, a result of the six-party nuclear talks, the North agreed to abandon its nuclear program in return for political and economic incentives from the South, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.But the document is now treated as a mere scrap of paper, with the talks deadlocked for nearly seven years. Hwang warned the North not to throw cold water on the nascent dialogue mood amid reports that the unpredictable country may fire a long-range rocket or conduct another nuclear test around October.The envoy said Beijing would not blindly patronize Pyongyang any more.\"Since President Xi Jinping took power, in particular, China-North Korea ties have been changing in quality because of the nuclear issue.\"The latest inter-Korean military crisis has highlighted not only the strength of the South Korea-U.S. alliance but also a shift in North Korea-China relations, he added.China used to blame both Koreas for tensions on the peninsula, including when the North launched a series of deadly attacks on the South in 2010.China took a bit different stance this time, Hwang said, apparently putting more pressure on the North.

The OPLAN 5015 was formulated last June to replace OPLAN 5027 by the chairmen of the two countries\u2019 Joint Chiefs of Staff. The allies have, since 1974, been assessing their joint defense plan every year, primarily to devise better responses to North Korea\u2019s military threats. \u201cIt is the first time that the OPLAN has dealt with the concept of a preemptive strike,\u201d a military source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.The updated scheme, which has already come into force, will allow the allies to consider a preemptive strike aimed at terminating WMDs such as atomic bombs, missiles and biological and chemical weapons when signs of their imminent use are detected from the North. They are believed to have been carrying out the joint Ulchi Guardian Freedom exercise under the scenario, focusing on minimizing damage in case of Pyongyang\u2019s use of a biochemical weapon. \u201cThe plan was revised as part of the two countries\u2019 annual efforts to reflect the threats we face, and they usually examine if there is any need to adjust their strategies after the UFG ends every year,\u201d another official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity.Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report, citing classified operational strategies. \u201cAny revelation of our military\u2019s operational plan does not contribute to not only our security, but also national interest,\u201d it said in a statement.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office indicted the 29-year-old suspect, whose identification was withheld, on charges of allegedly providing fake immigration documents to 12 job-seeking Egyptians and supporting them to enter fraudulently as refugees. He and his Korean accomplice were found to have received up to $10,000 per person in return, they added. Of the 12 illegal entrants, nine applied for the refugee status by falsely stating they were fleeing their country to avoid persecution.

This marks the first case in which a refugee broker was caught here.Under the Korean refugee law, refugee status can be granted to foreigners who are likely be persecuted on account of nationality, race, religion, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. After joining the U.N.

By July, the year\u2019s number had already exceeded 2,600, they added.The Korea Immigration Office suspects that over 80 percent of the refugee status-seekers are fake, the authorities said.\u201cThe number of Egyptian refugee status applications is on the rise, with the majority seeking jobs here. Many cases are found to be those abusing the refugee law that does not force deportation against their will,\u201d immigration office officials said. Foreigners under fears of persecution are allowed to apply for refugee status at an airport or seaport upon arrival. They are also allowed to work here if the refugee screening takes over six months. Various benefits are also provided, ranging from education and job training to medical services. As the government has tightened the refugee screening, the acceptance rate plummeted from 20 percent to around 4 percent in recent years.

North Korea may launch long-range missiles around that time, which would dampen the conciliatory mood.During the working-level Red Cross talks, the two sides will try to decide when to hold family meetings with how many people involved. Once those details are agreed upon, the Red Cross here will form a seven-person team to select individuals for the reunions.

Top leaders from 30 countries, including Russia, have announced their participation.President Park Geun-hye is also expected to take part in the event during her scheduled trip on Sept. 2-4. Cheong Wa Dae, however, has not yet made it official given the diplomatic and military sensitivity of the issue in light of relations with the U.S., which remains wary of China\u2019s rapid arms buildup and growing assertiveness in the region.\u00a0 The decision to send the military delegation was made upon request from the Chinese defense ministry, which reportedly wanted JCS chairman Choi Yun-hee to lead it.

At least until the end of the UFG set for Friday, the North may retain its military alertness to a certain extent, and the South will also adjust its defense posture accordingly, they noted. Under a breakthrough deal reached early Tuesday, both Koreas agreed to stop acts of hostilities to defuse the tensions.The rival Koreas were brought to the brink of a military clash after having a rare exchange of artillery fire last Thursday, with the North triggering the exchange with its initial firing of artillery shells at South Korean loudspeakers blaring anti-North propaganda.The South started the psychological warfare at the border on Aug. 10 in retaliation for land mine blasts that seriously injured two South Korean soldiers. Seoul accused Pyongyang of planting the mines on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone.Following the shelling, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared a semi-state of war, ordering armed forces to stand with full combat readiness.Major North Korean infiltration forces, special artillery troops and submarines had been forward deployed before being sent back to normal positions.Some of the North Korean submarines that had left their bases for operations, have returned back, the officials said, citing surveillance results.

South Korea viewed the expression as a de-facto apology and halted anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts along the border in return.But critics said it is difficult to accept the expression as an apology.\"The important thing is that they came to an agreement and that we now have an opportunity for the tensions to be decreased and we're starting to see that happening now,\" Kirby said. \"I think we still have a couple of more days here to take a hard look at this, but that's the most important thing -- that dialogue brought about an agreement to decrease the tensions.\"Kirby said the U.S. will continue to monitor how the agreement is carried out.\"As I said yesterday, action speaks louder than words.

The broadcasts and wartime declaration came to an end at noon, hours after the two sides clinched a six-point agreement in which Pyongyang displayed regret over a recent land mine blasts in the Demilitarized Zone and ensuing wounds on two South Korean soldiers in return for Seoul\u2019s conditional cessation of loudspeaker operations.\u00a0A soldier turns off the power switch for the loudspeakers installed along the border Tuesday at 12 noon.\u00a0(Joint Chiefs of Staff)They also agreed to hold formal talks in Seoul or Pyongyang \u201cat an early date\u201d to explore ways to mend their ties and have a working-level meeting in early September to arrange a fresh round of reunions of separated families in time for the Chuseok holidays at the end of the month. The announcement followed 43 hours of negotiations that kicked off Saturday. Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae\u2019s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo sat face-to-face with Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the North\u2019s National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People\u2019s Army, and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North\u2019s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s Central Committee, in the border village of Panmunjeom until early Tuesday. \u201cWe focused on extracting an apology for the land mine provocation and other recent incidents by North Korea as the subject (of the talks), and a promise to prevent a recurrence, which in fact resulted in protracted negotiations,\u201d Kim Kwan-jin said at a news conference at Cheong Wa Dae. \u201cBut the reason why we ceaselessly called for preventive steps was that otherwise, there would be one provocation threatening public safety after another -- we would not have been able to break the vicious circle.\u201d But criticism lingers over Seoul\u2019s failure to include in the accord a clear articulation of apology and preventive measures, as well as who is to blame for the mine explosions. Seoul officials defended themselves by saying that the word \u201cregret\u201d had never been stipulated in any past inter-Korean statements, while the caveat attached -- \u201cunless any abnormal situation takes place\u201d -- ensured that the propaganda broadcasts could be resumed at any time if the communist country staged a provocation in the future. In an apparent attempt to play down the show of regret, the North\u2019s Hwang Pyong-so later in the day repeated Pyongyang\u2019s denial of responsibility for the recent series of its provocations, saying that Seoul fabricated \u201cgroundless incidents\u201d and only escalated tensions that could induce an armed clash.\u201cThrough the urgent talks, the South Korean authorities should have realized that its fabrication of groundless incidents and unilateral judgment and behavior would only heighten tensions and could give rise to a military confrontation,\u201d he said in an interview with the North\u2019s Korean Central TV as he assessed the outcome of the talks.\u201cBut we think that it is a relief that our joint efforts set the mood for the improvement of inter-Korean relations,\u201d he was quoted as adding.The delegates of the two Koreas pose after their marathon talks at the border village of Panmunjeom on Tuesday.

(Unification Ministry)Following an 11-year break, the broadcasts were restarted on Aug. 11 along the Military Demarcation Line in retaliation for the Aug. 4 explosion of three mines suspected to have been buried by North Korean soldiers who illegally crossed the border. The blast inflicted serious injuries on the legs of two South Korean Army staff sergeants. After North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared a \u201cquasi-state of war\u201d last Thursday, his military put frontline troops in full combat readiness, sharply beefed up artillery forces and forward-deployed a majority of its submarines and other offensive assets. Signs of de-escalation showed soon after the deal, as some of the submarines that had left their bases appeared to have returned, Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said. Seoul\u2019s military officials had expressed concerns on Sunday that they were unable to locate about 50 undersea vehicles, or 70 percent of the North\u2019s submarine fleet. While welcoming the breakthrough, the South Korean military remained cautious, saying it was maintaining maximum readiness, which it would adjust according to the North\u2019s movements. U.S. Forces Korea are likely to take similar steps before lowering their Watch Condition level. Defense Minister Han Min-koo convened two separate meetings Tuesday to discuss follow-up measures with top military commanders and ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff executives. \u201cEven if the North does rescind the semi-war state, it will take a considerable amount of time and effort to bring the already deployed frontline artillery and other military forces back to normal,\u201d Kim said at a news briefing. \u201cOur military will flexibly downgrade its readiness, taking into account the level of threat from North Korea.\u201d By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","671":"All foreign leaders who will visit Beijing next month will attend a huge military parade marking the end of World War II, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming said Tuesday.

Choe is among the foreign guests to attend the Sept. 3 events, Zhang told reporters. It is unclear whether Choe, considered third-in-command behind North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, will attend a huge military parade on Sept. 3. The planned visit by Choe to China comes as political ties between Pyongyang and Beijing remain strained over North Korea's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons and wayward behavior. South Korean President Park Geun-hye will also visit Beijing for the events, but it remains undecided whether Park will attend the military parade.During a joint press conference with Zhang, Qu Rui, deputy director of the Office of the Parade Leading Team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said South Korea will send a high-level military delegation to the upcoming military parade. South Korea is among 31 nations that will send \"high-level military delegations to China to attend the parade,\" Qu said. North Korea is not among the countries that will send troops or military delegations to the Chinese parade. About 12,000 Chinese troops and soldiers from 11 nations, including Russia, as well as 200 aircraft will take part in the military parade. The Sept. 3 event is expected to demonstrate China's fast-growing military capabilities, while highlighting a rivalry between China and Japan. It also comes as neighboring countries of China keep a wary eye on Beijing's increasingly assertive actions in disputed waters, including the South China Sea, sparking a series of diplomatic rows with neighbors like the Philippines and Vietnam. China is also engaged in a bitter dispute with Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea.

Jackson served as a strategy adviser and a senior country director for the Pentagon from 2009 to 2014.Kim made the sensitive comment as he called for the deployment of a U.S. missile system, called the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery that is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles in their terminal stage.South Korea is struggling to walk a diplomatic tightrope between the U.S., Seoul's key ally, and China, Seoul's largest trading partner, over whether to allow the U.S. to deploy a THAAD battery to South Korea.Washington hopes to deploy the THAAD in South Korea to counter ballistic missile threats posed by North Korea, saying it is a purely defensive system.Still, China has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the possible deployment of a THAAD battery in South Korea, suspecting it is part of U.S. attempts to contain a rising China.

An international investigation concluded that the North torpedoed the ship, but the communist country has flatly denied the accusations.In May of that year, South Korea halted all cross-border trade and exchanges with the North, leaving only the joint industrial park in Kaesong, a North Korean border town, in operation.Liberal groups have long demanded that the government lift the sanctions to ease tensions and improve ties between the Koreas, but the conservative administrations of then President Lee Myung-bak and incumbent President Park Geun-hye have insisted the North first apologize and punish those responsible for the sinking.Rep.

The bilateral director-level security consultation, first launched in 1997, has been stalled for the last five years amid soured South Korea-Japan relations.The two countries attempted to resume the meeting of diplomatic and defense officials in late 2013, but all was in vain due to rising tension over territorial and historical issues under the Shinzo Abe administration. Japan's move to refurbish its defense forces has also fueled regional tension along with Prime Minister Abe's much-denounced visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine that year. A resumption of the security policy consultation meeting is widely expected to help Seoul and Tokyo recover their soured relations although they have yet to restore a summit meeting that has been stalled for nearly three years. It is also timed to make Seoul's voice heard ahead of Japan's quickening moves to re-strengthen its military forces.Japan and the U.S. are expected to revise their defense guidelines late next month as part of a legal process needed for the military build-up. The Japanese parliament is likely to start the related legislative efforts around May. The source said South Korea may try to repeat its concern over Japan's military rearmament at the envisioned April meeting as Seoul remains opposed to any military action by Tokyo on the Korean Peninsula without advance approval.

They exchanged views on regional political developments; strengthening strategic partnership; and boosting investment in infrastructure, energy and information technology sectors. \u201cOur relations have progressed constantly over the last 25 years and the last several years have seen marked growth and diversification in trade and investment,\u201d Burlacu told The Korea Herald at the Romanian Embassy in Seoul on Mar. 17. \u201cThrough our annual consultation, we keep dialogues moving forward and give more substance to our collaboration.\u201dBoth diplomats affirmed their commitment to develop the port of Constanta and better manage an IT collaboration center in Romania; they also signed a provisional contract to ease immigration procedures for businesspersons. Romania and Korea established diplomatic relations on March 30, 1990, and strategic partnership on September 11, 2008.\u00a0 Romanian Vice Foreign Minister Carmen Burlacu (left) and Romanian Ambassador to Korea Fabian Calin speak to The Korea Herald at the Romanian Embassy in Seoul on March 17 about the eight rounds of policy consultation held during Burlacu\u2019s visit and the EU Strategy for the Danube region. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)The strategic partnership led to a joint action plan decreeing holding annual consultations to promote political dialogue, economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges through tourism, educational and cultural programs.Discussions on implementing concrete measures are made to address bilateral, regional and international issues under the umbrella of the plan, Burlacu said.Romanian Ambassador to Korea Fabian Calin explained that policy consultations involve \u201creviewing the agenda\u201d without having to \u201cshow something extraordinary,\u201d such as signed agreements as is often the case during minister-level visits. \u201cThe point is to figure out where the gaps are in our relationship, to fill in the missing link,\u201d Calin said. \u201cLike in music, diplomats try to keep the rhythm of dialogue flowing free of interruption.\u201d Since 1990, bilateral trade volume increased nearly seventyfold, topping $1.24 billion last year. Over 220 Korean companies, including Samsung Otelinox, LG Electronics, Hyosung Corp., Doosan IBGM and Daewoo Mangalia Heavy Industries, have invested in Romania with cumulative investment over $650 million, according to Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry. Information communication technology, agriculture, renewable energy, oil and gas industries have much potential for enhancement, said Burlacu. Burlacu has been a career diplomat with experience at the United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, European Union and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Previously she was an ambassador to Ireland and became a state secretary of global affairs since May last year. The vice minister highlighted Romania\u2019s involvement in the EU Strategy for the Danube project, which aims to enhance physical connectivity along Europe\u2019s second longest river by developing harbors and infrastructures.\u201cKorean companies can enter into the heart of the Europe, all the way into Germany, through the Danube starting from the Black Sea,\u201d Burlacu explained. \u201cWatercourse is also the most economic and environment-friendly means of transport.\u201dThe Danube Strategy ranges from area-specific to regionwide projects, and Romania and Korea are in the process of identifying joint ventures, she said. Similar to the Mekong River Development Strategy, the EU-led initiative aims to increase mobility, protect environment, promote prosperity and strengthen institutional capacity and security across the Danube by conjoining various stakeholders.Calin pointed out, \u201cThere is a much deeper philosophy behind the strategy \u2015 facilitating regional dialogue across and between the Balkan and Central European countries and integrating them economically.\u201dBurlacu said that by participating, Korea can materialize visions envisioned in the biennial Asia-Europe Meeting and triennial World Water Forum.The ASEM is an international forum established in 1996 to foster cooperation between Europe and Asia through political, economic, social, cultural and educational ties to achieve a more balanced world order. Korea will host the seventh WWF in Daegu and Gyeongbuk from April 12-17 to address global water challenges and mobilize innovative solutions and joint policy actions.Romania will participate in the Water Forum to promote its hydro energy and transport industries. Romania also took part in the Yeosu World Expo 2012 in Korea with a pavilion dedicated to the Danube Delta that attracted over 800,000 visitors.

Kim pointed out that the North has conducted only three nuclear tests so far and it's unclear how successful they were. The Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security recently estimated that North Korea currently has between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons, some based on plutonium, others on uranium.

Since 2005, the program was renamed GTI and helmed by China, which sought to create an attractive investment destination for energy, tourism and transport sectors and environmental preservation. \n\r\nIn a meeting in Seoul last September, participating countries agreed to elevate the regional body to an international organization by 2016. \n\r\nNorth Korea was a member when the GTI was founded in 2005, but exited the union in 2009 citing lack of funding. However, Pyongyang recently showed its renewed interest in the project, referring to the region as \u201cthe linchpin\u201d of regional economic integration.\n\r\nLee Sang-jun, senior researcher at the Korea Research Institute for Human Settlement and well-known expert on North Korean city planning, made a pitch for a regional development strategy by enlarging existing projects underway in the area. \n\r\n\u201cJump-starting and augmenting projects in the Tumen River area will restore Korea\u2019s lost continental identity and facilitate integration into Eurasia,\u201d Lee said. \n\r\n\u201cOnce a multistakeholder mechanism is established and public infrastructure such as railways, roads, electrical lines and natural gas pipelines are built, we will be able to elevate the cooperation up a notch.\u201d \n\r\nThe area has long been underdeveloped and isolated despite its strategic value, experts point out. But in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest emanating from shifting geopolitical conditions \u2015 China\u2019s growing clout, Russia\u2019s economic woes and South Korea\u2019s transcontinental ambition. \n\r\n\u201cIt is critical for Korea to preemptively secure a foothold in the supranational cooperation mechanism to keep China\u2019s self-aggrandizing position in check,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe can do that by broadening the current bilateral cooperation between Beijing and Pyongyang or Moscow and Pyongyang to trilateral schemas involving Seoul, and ultimately to a multinational body encompassing all regional powers.\u201d \n\r\nLee proposed expanding the Rajin-Khasan project \u2015 a border area enterprise aimed at refurbishing North Korea\u2019s northeastern city of Rajin into a logistics hub and linking it with Russia\u2019s Khasan through the Trans-Siberian Railway \u2015 to elicit participation of Korea, China, Mongolia and Japan.\n\r\nRussia, for its part, has pushed its own \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d agenda in recent years, squeezed by Western-led sanctions and plunging petroleum prices. In an effort to stamp its footprint in Russia\u2019s eastern edges and venture into the Asia-Pacific, Moscow has actively garnered Seoul\u2019s support for joint investment in the Russian Far East and North Korea. \n\r\nRussia\u2019s Far East region holds vast reserves of energy and mineral resources and ample agricultural production capacities for the soaring East Asian economies, analysts say.

Two years ago, the divorced father of three was diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia, a rare brain disease with no effective treatment.Unable to move and work and with no viable help from his families, he relied on government-certified nannies to take care of his kids -\u2015 aged 10, 7 and 5 \u2015 in the evenings and on weekends when they are out of school and a state-run day care center.But things have gotten much more difficult for Seok this year as the Gender Ministry cut its budget for the child care program by 458 million won ($418,360).\u00a0With the cut, families with children aged 3 months to 12 years can now utilize the service for a maximum of 480 hours a year, compared to the previous 720. This means a daily nanny can only stay for an hour and 33 minutes a day.\u201cI need nannies to come in every day because of my medical condition,\u201d Seok told The Korea Herald. \u201cBut after the budget cuts, my nanny can only stay for less than two hours a day \u2015 which is devastating. The weekends are the worst ... They are just at home with me, but I literally cannot do anything for them.\u201dSince the Gender Equality Ministry established the program in 2007, the number of households who use the service increased dramatically from 6,000 to 54,362 in 2013. This year\u2019s budget cut is expected to deal a blow to such households as well as nannies hired by the government for the service.For Jeong Seoum-gyul, a 36-year-old working mother in Daegu, the limited hours of the program have turned into a financial burden. The part-time school teacher who also works at a car washing service had been relying on nannies to take care of her 29-month-old daughter.While the daughter stayed at a day care center, nannies were Jeong\u2019s only resort when she worked from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. at a car wash with her husband every morning.Now, because of the limited hours of the service, Jeong feels she is only left with terrible options.\u201cI either have to quit my job at the car wash or hire a nanny from a private company to take care of my daughter starting at 4 a.m., though I don\u2019t know if any nanny (from a private company) would be even willing to work at 4 a.m.,\u201d Jeong told The Korea Herald.\u201cEither way, I would have to spend at least about 600,000 won ($533) more every month. For people like us who have to make ends meet, that\u2019s not a small cost,\u201d Jeong said. What disturbs Jeong most, she said, is that the government decided to cut back the program without warning.\u201cI wish they at least had told me in advance so I could have planned ahead,\u201d Jeong said.\u201cThey told us the decision very abruptly without offering any alternative options for us. It feels almost as if I\u2019ve been conned by the government.\u201dThe ministry explains that the latest budget cut was due to \u201coverlapping\u201d child care programs offered by other ministries. The Education Ministry, for instance, offers an after-school child care service where schools look after children of working parents after classes are over. The Welfare Ministry, for its part, provides special child care services for babies aged from 6 to 36 months.\u201cParents still tend to prefer having nannies take care of their children at their homes instead of placing the children at day care centers,\u201d Gender Minister Kim Hee-jung had said in last year\u2019s National Assembly meeting. She criticized the Strategy and Finance Ministry for citing similar programs as a way to downsize the budget.The Gender Ministry said it would continue to seek ways to expand the program.\u201cWe acknowledge that some may find the things (resulting from the budget cuts) difficult,\u201d said Song Young-gwang from the ministry. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have discussions to tackle the issues.\u201dMeanwhile, the government\u2019s budget curtailment is also affecting the nannies, who have already been struggling with low wages, weak job security and the government\u2019s unilateral decisions on employment terms. As of February 2014, a total of 13,889 have been hired by the government for the child care service.Among many welfare workers hired by the government, nannies working for the child care program earn the lowest wages \u2015 6,000 won ($5.30) an hour. Those who care for the elderly earn 7,425 won, while those who work for people with disabilities make 8,810 won.Although the government raised the nannies\u2019 hourly wage from 5,500 won to 6,000 won this year, the workers were informed in September that they would no longer receive extra stipends for transportation. Up until September, the workers were given 1,000 won to 1,500 won per commute.Lee Kyung-seon, a nanny based in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, now spends about 100,000 won additionally every month because she no longer receives the transportation allowance.\u201cI make 12,000 won to care for a child for two hours, and I spend 4,000 won on transportation. So in the end, I am only making 4,000 won an hour, which is lower than the minimum wage \u2015 5,580 won,\u201d she told The Korea Herald.Observers said the government\u2019s decision overlooks the Labor Law, which states in Article 94 that an employer must consult with the majority of workers when amending rules of employment, and seek their consent if the rules are to be modified unfavorably for workers.The workers say the Gender Ministry informed them of the cut via text message.\u201cTransportation cost is just one of many problems,\u201d said labor attorney Kim Min-cheol. \u201cThe nannies must be given a total of 15 days of vacation every year by law. If they don\u2019t get these days off, they should be paid extra. But I know many nannies who didn\u2019t know the vacation time even existed.\u201cThe government as an employer cannot go against the nation\u2019s labor law,\u201d he added. \u201cThis should be fixed.\u201dKwon, a nanny in Gwangju, said she only learned about the country\u2019s Labor Standards Act last year, after almost eight years of working as a government-certified caretaker. After the transportation allowance cut, she commutes by walking, which takes about 40 minutes each way.\u201cIt was extremely shocking and disillusioning to find out that the government, not even a private company, does not follow the labor law.\u201dThe government has been stepping up efforts in recent years to provide a better welfare and support system for mothers nationwide, in an effort to fight the declining birthrate and aging society.Despite President Park Geun-hye\u2019s renewed emphasis in February on the need to tackle the population crisis, parents say they still suffer from inconsistent policies that fail to fully reflect reality.Korea\u2019s birthrate stood at 1.18 child per woman last year \u2015 the lowest in the OECD.

Yonhap News Agency obtained a copy of the statement.The scholars included Pulitzer Prize winner Herbert Bix of Binghamton University; William Paterson University history professor Theodore F. Cook; Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor John Dower; Harvard University professor Ezra Vogel and University of Chicago professor Bruce Cummings.The statement has been delivered to Abe, according to University of Connecticut professor Alexis Dudden. \"There is no easy path to a 'correct history.' Much of the archives of the Japanese imperial military was destroyed. The actions of local procurers who provided women to the military may never have been recorded,\" the statement said.\"But historians have unearthed numerous documents demonstrating the military's involvement in the transfer of women and oversight of brothels. Important evidence also comes from the testimony of victims,\" it said. \"The aggregate record they offer is compelling and supported by official documents.\"Though the suffering of victims should not be used for nationalist ends, \"denying or trivializing what happened to them is equally unacceptable,\" it said.Historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mainly from Korea which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of the now elderly Korean victims and Japan refusing to do so.\"Among the many instances of wartime sexual violence and military prostitution in the 20th century, the 'comfort women' system was distinguished by its large scale and systematic management under the military, and by its exploitation of young, poor, and vulnerable women in areas colonized or occupied by Japan,\" the statement said.It said the historians disagree over the precise number of victims, but \"ultimately, whether the numbers are judged to have been in the tens of thousands or the hundreds of thousands will not alter the fact of the exploitation carried out throughout the Japanese empire and the war zones.\"Even though historians dispute how directly the Japanese military was involved and whether women were coerced into sexual slavery, the statement said the \"evidence makes clear that large numbers of women were held against their will and subjected to horrific brutality.\"It also said that employing legalistic arguments focused on particular terms or isolated documents to challenge the victims' testimony \"both misses the fundamental issue of their brutalization and ignores the larger context of the inhumane system that exploited them.\"\"This year presents an opportunity for the government of Japan to show leadership by addressing Japan's history of colonial rule and wartime aggression in both words and action,\" the statement said. Noting that Abe spoke of the universal value of human rights, the importance of human security, and the suffering that Japan caused other countries, the statement said, \"We applaud these sentiments and urge Prime Minister to act boldly on all of them.\"We waited to hear what Prime Minister Abe would say during his speeches in the United States last week, and unfortunately his one brief aside comment about this issue further brushed away Japanese state responsibility for this awful history,\" professor Dudden, who led the statement, told Yonhap.\"In short, this statement is a direct appeal to the Japanese government to address this history squarely, accept responsibility for it ... and to desist from further distortions and politicization,\" she said.Dudden also said that she was thrilled to see more historians sign the statement than expected.\"They are not only in the U.S, but also all over the world including Europe and Australia.

Pinzon expressed being impressed by Korea\u2019s miraculous development from the ruins of the war, affirming his government\u2019s determination to follow suit. \u201cDue to our history of violence and conflict with guerilla groups,\u201d he said, \u201cColombia\u2019s defense ministry became the most important outlet for exercising public policy.\u201dCombating one of the bloodiest and longest insurgencies in modern history, the administration under President Juan Manuel Santos has made critical inroads into the peace process, the minister pointed out. The negotiations underway in Cuba led to three of the five points in the agenda being signed: land reforms to boost agricultural production, political participation of FARC members and counternarcotics policies. The more difficult parts remain with confiscating weapons and compensating victims. According to the New York Times, the process has reached a \u201cmake-or-break\u201d phase \u2015 the ultimate success hinging upon \u201cthe willingness of Colombians to make tough compromises\u201d with the guerilla organization. The Times credited President Santos for making strides in the deal, noting that reported incidents of violence dropped from over 2,000 in 2013 to less than 1,200 last year. With improved political stability and public security, the Colombian economy\u2019s growth has surpassed 4 percent annually for the last decade, one of the fastest rates in Latin America. Foreign direct investment rushed into Colombia, with spikes in 2011 ($13.4 billion) and 2012 ($15.8 billion), according to the World Bank. \u201cWe were only able to reach this stage by the combined success of our military and police, who put together their strategy, sacrifice and heroism,\u201d Pinzon said. \u201cWe can now devote efforts into noncombat areas like development, environment protection, border security, joint training and exercise, international peacekeeping and peace-building operations.\u201dPinzon invited Korean companies to participate in modernization programs through joint venture projects, training and technology transfer for the country\u2019s 420,000-strong military and law enforcement.In return, \u201cColombia stands ready to share our expertise in counterterrorism and conflict management to help relieve tensions with North Korea,\u201d he said. The 43-year-old wunderkind from Bogota is the youngest defense minister in Colombian history. He has an extensive background in economics, finance and public policy, having studied at Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University in the U.S.Colombia has relatively young ministers compared to other governments: Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin, 51; Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas Santa Maria, 52; Information Communication Technology Minister Diego Molano Vega, 47; and Education Minister Gina Maria Parody, 41. The trend of young leaders in office is not exclusive to the Santos administration, Pinzon said, explaining, \u201cAs a result of our conflict-ridden life, young Colombians have long been drawn to the public sphere with zeal.\u201d\u201cUnder such circumstances,\u201d he added, \u201cIt\u2019s natural for people to search for ways to help, support and change the country. This energy has actually changed our country.\u201dPinzon put ministers\u2019 first-rate academic credentials in the limelight, pointing out they helped steer government politics and policies in a progressive direction. The minister\u2019s own experience at the World Bank, Finance Ministry, Colombian Banking Association and Citigroup proved instrumental in economizing the defense budget. \u201cDefense is as much about economics as politics of security and order,\u201d Pinzon said. \u201cTo move massive resources, train personnel and update equipment, a modern military requires an integrative strategy combing public policy, private investment and social initiative, recognizing that peace cannot be made by force only.\u201dBy Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","705":"Tours by Chinese people to North Korea have been showing signs of getting back on track after Pyongyang lifted its months-long entry ban on foreign travelers imposed as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus, Chinese tour firms said Saturday. North Korea is half a world away from Ebola-hit West Africa, but the reclusive regime closed its doors to foreign tourists last October. The ban, which took a toll on Chinese travel firms specializing in tours to the North, was lifted earlier last week. A rail tour between Dandong, a border city in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning, and the North Korean border town of Sinuiju resumed on Monday. Two days later, a group of 97 Chinese tourists took part in a one-day bus tour to Sinuiju from Dandong. \"We have received bookings from about 20 Chinese nationals for a four-day tour to North Korea that departs on March 19,\" said an official at a Dandong-based travel agency, who asked not to be named. \"The number of customers is expected to grow ahead of the Labor Day holiday season,\" he added. Another tour route linking Hunchun, a border city in the Chinese province of Jilin, to North Korea's Rason special economic zone is set to be restarted, Chinese travel agents in Hunchun said. About 60,000 Chinese people are estimated to travel to North Korea via Dandong a year, with another 10,000 Chinese making tours to the North a year via Hunchun, according to Chinese industry estimates. North Korea is one of the world's most secretive and isolated nations, but Pyongyang has stepped up efforts to attract foreign tourists, mostly Chinese, since last year by offering more tour routes.Hit by decades of economic mismanagement and international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, North Korea is desperately poor. The North appears to be promoting its tourism sector to earn much-needed hard currency to prop up its regime.

The\u00a0 assailant said he did so in opposition to the Seoul-Washington joint military exercises.\"Thanks for all of the friendship and support! Means so much to the Lippert family! Back to work later next week,\" he said on his Twitter account, uploading two photos with his wife, son and dog.He made his first public outing on Friday since being released from the hospital three days ago by attending a dinner party for the U.S. Forces Korea hosted by a local research foundation, Gumgok.The attacker, named Kim Ki-jong, has been under probe after being arrested last week on charges of attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction. (Yonhap)","707":"The white-crowned sparrow, a tiny North American bird, is able to stay awake for seven straight days during migration.The bird\u2019s remarkable ability has been the subject of research at the Pentagon for the past six years, to find a way to keep their pilots and soldiers awake for as long as possible. In his book \u201c24\/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep\u201d published last year, Columbia University professor Jonathan Crary argues that any discoveries about the bird\u2019s special traits will affect not only the military but also the world of work and consumer culture.While South Korea may not know the bird\u2019s secrets, the country is already experiencing what Crary warns in his book -- a sleepless world that \u201cbecomes a non-stop work-site or an always-open-shopping-mall of infinite choices, tasks and selections.\u201dOne of the most sleep-deprived countries in the world, South Korea is already putting its people\u2019s health at risk by keeping them awake too long. A single South Korean person on average slept 6 hours and 53 minutes a night as of 2013, the lowest among the OECD. On top of its notoriously long working hours -- among the longest in the OECD -- South Korea is also known for its 24\/7 services and businesses, including convenience stores, saunas and \u201cquick service,\u201d a fast delivery service by motorcyclists available any time, day or night.About 15 percent of all Koreans who are employed full time are shift workers, many of them working in health care, transportation, entertainment and security. According to the Korean NeuroPsychiatric Association, almost 25 percent of Korean shift workers suffered from sleep disorders in 2013.Experts say that such sleep disturbances, as well as the country\u2019s light pollution and excessive use of smart gadgets are a threat to the health of its people. Artificial light, including the glow from electronic devices and illumination of the night sky, are thought to be the biggest causes of sleep deprivation.\u201cIt\u2019s like a vicious circle,\u201d said neurologist Lee Hyang-woon, who currently heads the Epilepsy and Sleep Center at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital in Seoul.\u201cThose who work at 24\/7 convenience stores may have sleeping disorders because they have to be up for night shifts. At the same time, because that convenience store keeps its lights on 24\/7, someone else in the city may not be able to sleep.\u201dAccording to the Health Ministry, the number of Koreans who sought medical help for sleeping disorders, including insomnia, increased from 260,000 in 2009 to 380,000 in 2013.The number of people treated for depression, which can be both the cause and result of insomnia, also increased here, from 556,000 in 2009 to 665,000 in 2013.Lee said working night shifts, as well as sleep deprivation due to heavy workload, may lead to insomnia as well as other diseases. \u201cMelatonin, an antioxidant that makes us sleepy, is generally produced at night. But late shifts as well as irregular exposure to light can disrupt its production,\u201d she said. \u201cMelatonin is also integral to the health of one\u2019s immune system.\u201dAn overseas study of 120,000 nurses found that those who worked night shifts were the most likely to develop breast cancer. In 2007, the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research into Cancer concluded that shiftwork that involves circadian disruption probably increases the risk of cancer.Crary predicts that once non-sleep products are aggressively promoted by pharmaceutical companies after they are used to create sleepless soldiers, the drugs would eventually become a necessity, rather than an option, for many. Kim Joo-young, a 26-year-old call center agent in Seoul, said she would purchase such products immediately if they were available today.She works from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. five days a week, and has suffered indigestion, mild depression and hand tremors because of the poor quality of sleep she gets from working shifts. \u201cWhat depresses me the most is that I can\u2019t do anything during the day -- that I have to sleep when everyone else is out there doing their own things,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least once that drug becomes available, I would be able to do things during the day. My life would be more than just work and sleep. I don\u2019t mind not sleeping if it means I get more time for myself.\u201dYet, in Shakespeare\u2019s words, Kim and many others would lose a lot should the drugs ever become available \u2013 \u201csore labor\u2019s bath, the balm of hurt minds, great nature\u2019s second course, and chief nourisher in life\u2019s feast.\u201d By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","708":"Kim Ki-jong, the man who attacked U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert with a knife last week, was a pro-North Korean activist with a clear intention to kill the envoy, police said Friday.\u201cKim, who had anti-American sentiment from before the attack, said he planned the attack by taking into consideration the envoy\u2019s representativeness of the U.S.,\u201d the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said in a briefing. Police forwarded the case to the prosecutors, with charges of attempted murder, battery of a foreign delegate and obstruction of official duties. Their investigation into whether Kim violated the National Security Law and if there was any accomplice or an organization behind him will continue, they said.\u00a0 Kim Chul-jun, a senior police officer at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, announces the results of the investigation into the knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert at Jongno Police Station in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)Kim was found to have contacted a man previously convicted of spying for North Korea and a known member of a pro-North organization, but officials are yet to find tangible evidence linking either party to Kim. \u201cKim denied his intention to kill the ambassador. But due to the fact that he approached the envoy with a knife and attacked him immediately upon finding him, and stabbed the victim more than twice with the ferocity that was described as \u2018hacking,\u2019 we\u2019ve concluded that his purpose was to murder (Lippert),\u201d police said.Kim\u2019s attack on March 5 during a morning seminar sparked diplomatic concerns over the Korea-U.S. alliance, reignited political debate over pro-North forces and prompted days of rallies by citizens in support of Lippert.While defined by the U.S. as an attack by a radical individual, Seoul officials and politicians lambasted the aggression as an attack on the alliance. Korean authorities escalated their investigation and bolstered security around foreign envoys here.Police said the 55-year-old attacker appears to have acted out of frustration with the Korea-U.S. military drill and that Kim, calling himself a patriot, believed the drill was the main reason hindering inter-Korean relations.The SMPA said they found Kim to be pro-North based on his testimonies, and that they confirmed he visited the communist country seven times. They also found evidence that Kim elaborately premeditated the attack such as by looking at Lippert\u2019s blog and searching Lippert\u2019s height and the criminal law the day before. Kim was arrested after approaching and wounding Lippert in the face and left wrist with a 25-centimeter knife. The police launched an 83-member team to investigate the case and questioned a total of 35 witnesses including the seminar\u2019s organizer Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation. They searched Kim\u2019s home and office and looked into his recent whereabouts, phone logs and bank accounts.After confiscating 43 items including books, the police said they received confirmation from experts that 24 of them contained contents \u201cbenefiting the enemy.\u201dOn Thursday, police visited Lippert for testimonies during which the envoy stated he wished for Kim to be punished.Upon the attack, President Park Geun-hye blasted it as an \u201cattack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance,\u201d while ordering a thorough investigation on the case. She visited the hospitalized ambassador Monday on the coattails of returning from her Middle East tour.The ruling Saenuri Party defined the attack as \u201can act by followers of North Korea,\u201d and launched an offensive against the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as \u201cbeing a host for pro-North figures.\u201dAlthough the investigation has not unearthed a direct connection between Kim and the NPAD, the Saenuri Party urged the opposition to announce they will sever ties with pro-North Korean advocates. The NPAD said they were mulling legal actions against Saenuri lawmakers that accused them of having connections with Pyongyang.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","709":"South Korea's main opposition party leader said Friday he believes U.S. troops should remain in the country in the event of inter-Korean reunification to help ensure peace and stability in the region.Moon Jae-in, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD), made the remarks in a meeting with Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs columnist for the Financial Times, according to the party's senior spokesman Kim Yung-rok, who sat in on the meeting.\"As (U.S. Forces Korea) contribute to maintaining peace between the two Koreas and maintaining a balance and peace in the entire Northeast Asian region, we need them,\" the spokesman quoted Moon as saying during the meeting at the National Assembly building in Seoul.About 28,500 American troops are currently stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Korean states technically at war.\"The role of U.S. Forces Korea must be maintained even after reunification,\" Moon said, according to Kim. \"U.S. Forces Korea are needed until a Northeast Asian security regime is formed.\"The NPAD leader also urged the administration of President Park Geun-hye to restore dialogue between the Koreas without pre-conditions in order to open the path to reunification.\"In order to bear fruit during the Park Geun-hye government's term, there must be a summit within the year,\" he said. \"If the government takes such an approach, we will not spare our cooperation.\"The Park administration's single, five-year term ends in February 2018, and by law, the president cannot seek re-election.Earlier in the day, Moon also met with Chinese ambassador to Seoul Qui Guohong and accepted the envoy's invitation to visit China.\"I would like to visit China as soon as possible and discuss such issues as the situation in Northeast Asia and ways to develop bilateral ties,\" he said.Moon also called for China's \"active role\" in reunifying the two Koreas.

North Korea has been in an unusual defensive mode since a landmark U.N. inquiry detailed systematic, widespread and gross human rights abuses in the reclusive state. The North's human rights record was take up as a standing agenda by the U.N. Security Council last December, putting more pressure on the legitimacy of the Pyongyang regime. In the interview with the Global Times, a state-run newspaper with close ties to China's ruling Communist Party, the counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing criticized South Korea and the U.S. for holding a conference in Washington over its human rights record last month. Referring to the Feb. 17 conference hosted by Washington-based Center for Strategic & International Studies, the North Korean diplomat, whose name was withheld, said South Korea and the U.S.have \"plotted an extremely despicable conspiracy against North Korea using so-called 'defectors.'\"Defending the country's human rights situation, the North Korean diplomat warned that those who are \"trying to discredit North Korea are bound to fail and will be severely punished.\" North Korea has strongly protested against the ground-breaking U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, rejecting accusations of human rights abuses as evidence of hostile U.S. policy toward the communist regime.

The year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at about 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims alive today.Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, in June by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come out in August to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat of World War II.But many analysts predict that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings. (Yonhap)","712":"Prosecutors raided the head office of POSCO Engineering & Construction Co. (POSCO E&C;) on Friday, launching an investigation into allegations that the company created massive slush funds overseas. (Yonhap)Late last month, the construction arm of South Korea's top steelmaker, POSCO, said two executives and about 10 employees in charge of construction projects in Vietnam were reprimanded in July for operating illegal slush funds worth about 10 billion won ($8.9 million).The money, which had been accumulated by exaggerating the amount the South Korean company needed to pay local subcontractors in Vietnam, was later given out as monthly rebates to contractors from 2009 to 2012, it said. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said a team of prosecutors and investigators was sent to the main office in Incheon, west of Seoul, to secure documents on overseas construction projects, accounting books and computer hard disks.Following the move, prosecutors will analyze bank transactions by the company officials involved in the case and obtain audit materials from the company, according to prosecution sources.Prosecutors also plan to summon the company officials to determine the exact size and use of the slush funds, they said.The raid came one day after Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo declared a war against corruption in a statement. Lee previously ordered a thorough investigation into the case during a parliamentary interpellation session on Feb. 26.Some have raised suspicions that the secret funds were actually created by the company or that some of the money was funneled into the country.Last year, the National Tax Service referred POSCO to the prosecution on charges of inflating sales figures in transactions with its affiliates.But POSCO E&C; denies the allegations, calling it \"an individual case of corruption committed by company executives in charge of sales in Vietnam who are obsessed with their performance.\" (Yonhap)","713":"South Korea and the United States were to wrap up their joint annual war game aimed at honing deterrence against North Korea on Friday, officials said, amid Pyongyang's strong criticism and threats of harsh retaliation.Involving some 10,000 South Korean and 8,600 American troops, the computerized command post exercise, called Key Resolve, began on March 2 to improve the combined forces' operation and combat capabilities to deter threats from North Korea.Seoul and Washington finished the first phase of the exercise on March 5, one day ahead of schedule, with the second phase to be closed later in the day after the after-action review, according to Seoul's defense ministry officials.\"The simulation exercise based upon various scenarios on the assumption of North Korea's infiltration into the South provided troops of the two nations with chances to have real-life experiences,\" a defense ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity.\"The joint plan on how to respond to North Korea's local provocations was also applied to the exercise,\" he added, pointing to the guideline that the allies draw on some 30 possible scenarios of the North's provocations in and around the region.Another official said the two sides also implemented their customized deterrence plan against Pyongyang's nuclear threats and weapons of mass destruction.Meanwhile, the joint field training drill Foal Eagle has been taking place as scheduled to run until April 24, according to officials.The tactical training that mobilizes about 200,000 Korean and 3,700 American troops kicked off on March 2 and has involved a set of land, sea and air maneuvers.Five countries -- Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and Britain -- have participated in the exercises, with the Neutral Supervisory Commission observing and monitoring them to ensure they do not break the Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.The large-scale annual exercises have further heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. On the first day of the exercises, North Korea fired two short-range missiles into the East Sea in an apparent saber-rattling.Repeating its long-held claims that the exercises are \"dress rehearsals\" for a northward invasion with nuclear weapons, the North has issued near-daily threats of harsh retaliation against \"hostile\" forces.But the allies have stressed the exercises have been staged on a regular basis and they are defensive in nature, aimed solely at bolstering readiness against a possible invasion by North Korea.

Their hourly wage was only 48 percent as high as that of full-time workers, a 17.8 percent decrease from 2004. According to the Korea Women\u2019s Development Institute, only 53.9 percent of all South Korean women were in the workforce in 2013. The rate left South Korea in 25th place among the 33 OECD countries.While the employment rate was low, South Korean women had the longest working hours among OECD countries in 2011, with a single Korean woman working an average of 41.7 hours a week. Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy also had the lowest employment of women with post-secondary degrees, at 61.2 percent, in 2012. The OECD average was 78.6 percent.

Only need to meet some demands... Many countries from Northern Europe, Southeast Asia and South America are saying they will buy nuclear reactor information. Fear selling the entire information will undermine President Park (Geun-hye)'s efforts to export nuclear reactors,\" the posting said.The hacker did not say how much money he wanted but warned that South Korea will end up losing much more if it tries to save a few hundreds of millions of dollars.Officials from the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. (KHNP) said they have not yet been able to determine the nature or sensitivity of the released documents as safety protocol was blocking the downloading or opening of the files.The latest posting marked the fifth of its kind since Dec. 15.Until Thursday, the hacker had demanded the state-run KHNP shut down some of the country's nuclear reactors, threatening to \"bring destruction\" to the power plants unless the demand was met before Christmas.Nothing happened on or after Christmas, and the KHNP insists the hacker could not have obtained any classified information as its internal server has been completely isolated since early last year.In the latest posting, the hacker \"congratulated\" the KHNP for finding 7,000 viruses but claimed 9,000 more were awaiting his or her order.The information released Thursday reportedly included the transcript of a telephone conversation between President Park and the U.N. chief, Ban Ki-moon, on Jan. 1.

The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Kim had told officers the reason he brought a knife was because his previous attempt to harm a Japanese ambassador to Seoul by hurling pieces of rock in 2010 had failed. He, however, said he did not mean to kill the U.S. ambassador.Kim's attorney, Hwang Sang-hyeon, also said Kim's attack was more of a \"symbolic performance\" than attempted murder.Authorities are now investigating what Kim had been up to since Feb. 17, the day he received an invitation to attend the breakfast event where the incident happened.Kim is currently hospitalized for a broken ankle but is continuing to be questioned by the authorities.Police have said they will refer the case to prosecutors by Friday.They are also investigating whether Kim violated a controversial security law that bans South Koreans from openly endorsing rival North Korea. More than a dozen books were found from Kim's home that are suspected of being in violation of the law.South Korea remains technically at war with the North after the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

She is also expected to explain the results of her four-nation Middle East trip that ended Monday.Moon, speaking to reporters after a visit to the Korea Federation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, said his aim is to have \"frank discussions\" on how to revive the economy.\"As our economy is in a difficult state, that's probably the biggest concern of the president, and the opposition party's wish is the same,\" he said.On holding his first formal meeting with Park since the election, he said, \"What (special) feelings or thoughts could there be.\"Park had a casual meeting with the two party leaders during a government function early this month and agreed to invite them to a formal get-together after she returned from the trip. The meeting was first proposed by her party chief, which the president accepted, the party said.On Friday, Park will also invite Prime Minister Lee One-koo and the respective chiefs of the National Assembly, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and National Election Commission to brief them on the outcome of her trip to the Middle East, her spokesman Min Kyung-wook said in a press briefing.\"I hope it is seen as a move to communicate widely,\" he said, apparently mindful of criticism that Park does not communicate enough in making decisions.The trip to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar was largely aimed at expanding ties beyond oil and construction to health care and information and communications technology, among other areas. (Yonhap)","719":"North Korea should end its nuclear activities and allow U.N. nuclear inspectors to return to the North to monitor its Yongbyon nuclear complex as the first step toward complete denuclearization, Seoul's top nuclear envoy said Thursday.The remarks by Hwang Joon-kook came as diplomatic efforts are under way to gauge Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize before the long-stalled six-party talks resume.Seoul and four nations involved in the six-party talks -- the United States, China, Japan and Russia -- have recently reached a consensus on conditions for resuming the denuclearization talks that also involve the North.The five nations also shared the need to have \"exploratory dialogue\" with Pyongyang to test its sincerity about denuclearization, according to the foreign ministry.\"Now is the time to deliver the consensus by the five members to the North and seek to have so-called 'exploratory talks' with it,\" Hwang told a forum in Seoul. \"If we can find Pyongyang's sincerity, the six-party talks can be resumed.\"Hwang said that Pyongyang should end its ongoing nuclear activities and invite inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the North to resume their monitoring.\"North Korea should halt its plutonium and uranium nuclear activities at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allow the IAEA inspectors to return as the first step toward complete denuclearization.\"North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors in 2009 and restarted its atomic activities after it walked out of the six-party talks in late 2008.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Since the latest nuke test, North Korea has demanded the unconditional resumption of the six-party talks, but Seoul and Washington have claimed that the North should first show its sincerity about denuclearization.Hwang said that Seoul is \"willing\" to have the talks with Pyongyang, but the ball is in the North's court as it should first demonstrate its willingness to give up its nuclear weapons.\"As North Korea has been advancing its nuclear capability, the next several years will be very important (for us to achieve the goal of the North's denuclearization),\" he said. \"If the North believes that time is on its side, it might be a miscalculation.\" (Yonhap)","720":"The government will distribute information on missing children via Facebook starting mid-May, in hopes of bettering its chance of finding them through the popular social networking site.The National Police Agency said Tuesday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Facebook to send alerts to its users\u2019 mobile phones if they are in a search area where the children have gone missing. The service, called an \u201camber alert\u201d in the U.S., will allow users to receive information such as missing children\u2019s photos, names and ages. It will send the alerts 3.5 times per month and release them only with the parent\u2019s consent. Until now, police relied only on its smartphone application to spread information on missing children. The alerts were also shared among local banks, media outlets and hospitals. With the new alert system, the police will access nearly 14 million Facebook users nationwide and the company\u2019s location tracking system to track down missing children. The police also signed an agreement with Korea\u2019s top portal operator Naver to distribute missing children information since late April.

Embassy officials said they were \"eager\" to help but are waiting for a response from the U.S. government, according to authorities.The questioning is intended more as a formality than a necessity, as officials already have obtained details from witnesses, they said.Lippert was taken unawares by a knife-wielding man on Thursday morning when he was preparing for a speech at a performance arts hall in downtown Seoul.The 55-year-old assailant, Kim Ki-jong, was arrested at the scene and has been detained on various charges, including attempted murder. Kim said he wanted to alert the U.S. to the \"damage\" it was causing to inter-Korean reconciliation.South Korea remains technically at war with rival North Korea after the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The U.S. stations more than 28,000 troops here to deter provocations from the North, but hardcore nationalists argue that their presence hurts more than helps the mood for Korean unification.A special law enforcement task force has been assembled since the attack to uncover whether Kim had ties to North Korea. The team comprised of more than 100 law enforcement officials is also interested in his motive.Kim was recovering from a broken ankle at a hospital in southern Seoul, but will continue to be questioned about his motive by the authorities.Police intend to refer his case to prosecutors by Friday.They are also continuing their probe into allegations that Kim violated a controversial security law here that bans South Koreans from openly praising North Korea.More than a dozen books have been found in Kim's home that were dangerously pro-North Korea\" in nature, they said. (Yonhap)","722":"South Korea's human rights watchdog said Wednesday it has confirmed that the former head of a professional baseball club here violated players' human rights by keeping tabs on their private activities last year.The National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRC) said Choi Ha-jin, former president of the Lotte Giants, illegally reviewed closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of hotels where the team stayed on road trips to watch players from April to June 2014.Choi resigned from his post late last year. He acknowledged that he had asked the team officials to secure CCTV footage, but claimed he had first asked them to let his players know before they were monitored.The NHRC has carried out its own probe since the end of last year and found that the players were actually not informed of the planned monitoring in advance.The organization said it has decided to submit a list of recommendations to the Korea Baseball Organization to prevent similar violations in the future.\"We hope this incident serves as an opportunity to create a detailed guideline for creating a more humane sports environment,\" an NHRC official said. (Yonhap)","723":"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should apologize in unequivocal terms for the country's sexual enslavement of women during World War II if he delivers a speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress, a former American lawmaker said Tuesday.Eni Faleomavaega, who served as a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years before retirement this year, issued the call in an article contributed to the newspaper Hill, saying the House chamber, where Abe could make a speech, is where a landmark 2007 House resolution on sexual slavery victims passed.The chamber is also where President Franklin Roosevelt gave his renowned \"date which will live in infamy\" speech the day after the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, he said.\"If Abe is invited to speak in a chamber of historic significance, it would be only fitting and proper for him to bring final closure to certain historic issues regarding the Second World War,\" Faleomavaega said. \"Abe could use the occasion of his visit to the American Congress to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historic responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for the historic human rights violations committed against the Comfort Women,\" he said.Though most victims have died, survivors deserve justice and closure in their final days, the former lawmaker said. \"They have waited too long. It is time for Japan to apologize,\" he said.Abe could also reaffirm Japan's 1995 statement of apology, known as the Murayama Statement, where the country apologized for its imperialistic past. The nationalist prime minister has been accused of trying to revise the apology statement.\"A reaffirmation of this official apology for the aggression of the Pacific War at the site where President Roosevelt spoke would make a deep impression not only on members of Congress but on the American people, the Comfort Women survivors and other neighbors in Asia,\" Faleomavaega said.\"Such a sincere apology would be an act of true statesmanship. And it would go a long way toward providing some comfort to the Comfort Women survivors,\" he added.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, were forced to work at front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

They are uncertain because there is no transparency whatsoever, and as a result, the potential for miscalculation, in that circumstance, like it would be anywhere else, is very, very high,\" he said.The commander also said the U.S. Pacific Command, especially U.S. Forces Korea, always remain in a \"ready to fight tonight\" type of posture.\"My responsibility as a component of PACOM, like the other components, is to ensure that force that is concentrated there on that Korean peninsula is sustained, able to do what it needs to do and that we're also ready to reinforce it if that is what is needed to be,\" he said.

The KCSC, however, lifted the ban on Ashley Madison on Tuesday, following the decision by the Constitutional Court to repeal the anti-adultery law on Feb. 26. In the historical ruling, which came 62 years after the law was enacted, the court judged that an article of the criminal code was unconstitutional as it violates individuals' freedom to choose their sexual partners and their right to privacy. The KCSC said it allowed the site to reopen as the legal grounds for the ban no longer exist, but added it will \"keep close tabs on the site for any potential abuse that might lead to sexual-related crimes.\" Launched in 2001, Ashley Madison has been a huge success in the United States, Taiwan and Brazil. It has recently gained popularity in Hong Kong and Japan.

(Yonhap)","726":"Ruling party lawmakers are putting last-ditch efforts on legislating a long-held bill to address North Korean human rights issues amid partisan differences over policies toward the reclusive regime.The Saenuri Party and the government said last week that they would consider fast-tracking the North Korean human rights bill in June to expedite the legislation unless they reach an agreement by the end of this month with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. \u201cIt is a shame that the National Assembly has still not passed the bill,\u201d said Rep. Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and unification. \u201cIf we fail to pass the bill again, we would be abandoning our historical duty.\u201d The first draft of the North Korean human rights bill was introduced in 2005. Rep. Kim Moon-soo of the Grand National Party, predecessor to the Saenuri Party, and fellow legislators submitted the bill to the Assembly\u2019s committee on foreign affairs and unification, but the committee failed to pass the bill in time as ruling and opposition lawmakers locked horns over the content.The bill was resubmitted in 2008 and passed the committee. But it made no headway at the plenary session as opposition parties blocked the passage, saying it would provoke North Korea and damage already strained inter-Korean ties.The bill was put back into the spotlight last year when the United Nations adopted a landmark resolution against Pyongyang, calling for a referral of North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. Boosted by the U.N. resolution, Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party and fellow lawmakers repackaged previous legislation and proposed a comprehensive version of the North Korean human rights bill last November. The updated bill calls for the government to appoint a special ambassador for North Korea\u2019s human rights; to establish a comprehensive archive to investigate and collect human rights abuse cases; and to offer support for activities by human rights groups. The progressive bloc, however, criticized the conservatives\u2019 version as not comprehensive enough. The liberals pointed out that the bill lacks direct support for North Korean people such as food and medical aid, while the conservatives place importance on transparency over assistance. The opposition also claimed the bill could cause unexpected clashes with the North. They believe it would encourage anti-North groups to \u201cfurther provoke\u201d Pyongyang, such as by sending leaflets to the North. In October last year, North Korea responded by shooting down the balloons carrying the leaflets.The opposition proposed their own version of the North Korean human rights bill earlier this year. It highlighted improving the livelihood of North Koreans by providing direct humanitarian support. It also planned to build a dedicated agency to oversee the distribution of assistance. As political bickering continued over the bill, other countries have come forward by addressing the North\u2019s human rights abuses.The U.S. passed the North Korea Human Rights Act in 2006 and extended it until 2017. It aims to help North Korean refugees by providing humanitarian and legal assistance to them and grants to organizations to promote human rights in North Korea. Japan also enacted a similar act in 2004. It is designed to resolve the abduction of Japanese nationals to the North while bringing the public and international community\u2019s attention to North Korea\u2019s human rights conditions. Unlike the bills by the U.S. and Japan, experts believe that Seoul\u2019s version will take on a more profound and significant meaning. They pointed out that South Korea has a higher stake with the inter-Korean relationship.\u201cAs for the South Korean government, the bill will serve a different purpose from the U.S. and Japan,\u201d said Hong Seong-phil, a law professor at Yonsei University. \u201cThe bill will help the Korean government formulate its reunification policy, so that it can prepare for the two Koreas\u2019 reunification.\u201d Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies, suggested the government take a cautious approach in legislating the bill. \u201cEven if the bill were to be passed, the (Korean) government should apply it carefully as to not provoke the North. Until then, the government should serve as a middleman between the North and regional powers such as the U.S. and Japan,\u201d Yang said.

At the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, Gender Equality and Family Minister Kim Hee-jung tacitly urged Tokyo to face up to history and resolve the issue in line with its commitment to tackling violence against women. It was the first time for Seoul to raise the issue at the panel. \u201cI am encouraged to see how much progress has been made around the world in securing greater safety for women. But no such progress has been made regarding the thousands of women who were forced into sexual slavery during World War II,\u201d she said in her keynote address at the meeting in New York.\u00a0 Gender Equality and Family Minister Kim Hee-jung delivers a keynote address at the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in New York on Monday. (Yonhap)\u201cWe must face up to past wrongdoings in order to not repeat history, and to ensure that women and children can enjoy a peaceful future.\u201dAs her ministry seeks to enlist documents related to the sex slavery as UNESCO heritage items, Kim boosted hopes for the registration process to be completed this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the peninsula from Japanese rule and the foundation of the U.N. She has long been leading the UNESCO drive since serving as a lawmaker. Shortly before the event, she held a meeting with Gay McDougall, a former U.N. special rapporteur who authored a landmark 1998 report detailing Japan\u2019s \u201csystematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices\u201d during the war. \u201cBecause the issue of the so-called comfort women is directly linked with women\u2019s human rights during conflict, which is a universal value, we should learn lessons through the materials that such a tragedy must not repeat again in human history,\u201d the minister said at a news conference ahead of the U.N. meeting. Seoul and Tokyo have had five rounds of director general-level talks since last April to end the dispute but apparently made little progress due to stark differences in their positions. Seoul demands an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that normalized their testy bilateral ties.\u201cWhat our government is demanding is that Japan acknowledge its past misconduct, make a sincere apology and provide correct history education for future generations so that this will not occur again,\u201d Kim added.

She said the draft included three key elements of banning unjust business favors and bribe taking and preventing public officials from pursuing private benefits in handling their given work. But the last element was omitted from the final law, she said.Commenting on the controversy over the law's constitutionality for including journalists and private school teachers among those subject to it, Kim said, \"I don't think this goes against the Constitution.\"\u00a0She cited a recent public survey in which nearly 70 percent of South Koreans answered in favor of the inclusion. \"I think we can't just criticize this as wrong at a time when there are already moves to reform in the civilian sector,\" she said. \"The law, in particular, expanded its scope to fields with strong social responsibilities, so I also don't think this violates people's rights for equality.\"Last week, the Korean Bar Association filed a petition with the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the law, arguing that it has elements that possibly go against the Constitution and problems of fairness.The association said the law's inclusion of journalists among those subject to it can infringe on freedom of the press and people's rights for equality and the law's articles requiring people to report their spouses' acceptance of a bribe or expensive gifts to the authorities or face criminal punishment go against principles of freedom of conscience and self-responsibility in the Constitution.During the news conference, Kim also voiced regret for the law's limitation of the scope of family members with duty to report acceptance of bribes to \"spouse.\"The event comes amid rival parties' moves to amend the newly passed anti-corruption law among mounting questions over its scope and constitutionality.The bill's hasty passage is widely seen as an attempt by lawmakers to please voters ahead of next year's parliamentary elections as public demand for the legislation has been high in a country where corruption involving public officials causes national outrage.The law is scheduled to go into effect in September 2016 with a grace period of one and a half years from the day when it is promulgated.

We'll let the investigation play itself through,\" she said. \"I'm not going to speculate on the motivation.

Seoul remains technically at war with Pyongyang since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.\"I examined some 1,600 instances of material evidence submitted by the prosecution and found that most of it is irrelevant to the case and much was not what I owned or made,\" the 40-year-old said during the hearing at the Seoul Central District Court.\"The talk show has no enemy-benefiting elements or a purpose to benefit the enemy,\" her lawyer said.Prosecutors earlier submitted as evidence CDs containing transcripts and videos of the \"Unification Talk Concert,\" evidence showing her attending other \"enemy-benefiting\" events, court rulings on relevant cases, blog postings and emails praising the North Korean regime.Her Korean-American co-host Shin Eun-mi was deported in January over similar allegations.

In a partial diplomatic reshuffle last month, South Korea tapped the 67-year-old Kim, a former defense minister who headed the National Security Council at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, as the new ambassador to China.China has notified South Korea of its consent to Kim's appointment, the diplomat said on the condition of anonymity. \"Arrangements have been made for Ambassador Kim to take up his post as early as this month,\" the diplomat said.Kim would become South Korea's first top diplomat to China with a military background since the two nations established diplomatic ties 23 years ago. Since graduating from the Korea Military Academy in 1971, Kim had served in various capacities in the South Korean Army. He was the Army chief of staff in 2005 and the defense minister from 2007 to 2008. President Park Geun-hye named Kim as her top national security adviser in early 2013. But, he stepped down in May 2014 because of his controversial remarks over the role of his national security team in connection with the Sewol ferry disaster that claimed more than 300 lives.

While the installation attracted some 5 million visitors with its photogenic presence during its month-long display, critics raised suspicions that Lotte allegedly used it to allay safety concerns over the mall.As part of the plan to recycle the display, Lotte said it will launch a display titled \"Come Swing with Rubber Duck X Fabrikr\" where it will install 24 rocking chairs that have been made with parts from the animal figure.The floor and ceiling of the exhibition venue will be designed to emulate wind and water, so that visitors who sit in the rocking chairs will feel as if they are riding the rubber duck, Lotte said in a press release.Some parts of the rubber duck will be re-used to make souvenirs for shoppers and will be distributed on a first-come first-served basis next month, it added.

South Korea hopes that its companies can secure some of the projects.Park and Al Thani also observed the signing of a memorandum of understanding calling for cooperation on training nuclear experts and on building a nuclear reactor for medical and other research purposes.South Korea said the MOU could help its companies win projects in case Qatar decides to build nuclear reactors in the future.The move came just days after Park and Saudi Arabia's new monarch observed the signing of an MOU calling for a joint partnership on a nuclear reactor developed by South Korea for export to water-scarce countries, including the Middle East.South Korea said the MOU could help its companies win a US$2 billion project to build two mid-size commercial reactors in Saudi Arabia if the desert kingdom decides to build the reactors after a preliminary review set to end by 2018.In Kuwait, Park held talks with Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and sought his interest and assistance to ensure that South Korean companies can participate in industrial and infrastructure projects in the oil-rich country.In Abu Dhabi, Park was upbeat over an MOU on cooperation on halal food products as it could give Seoul access to the huge global halal market, which is expected to grow to $1.62 trillion by 2018.Halal is an Arabic word meaning \"lawful\" or \"permitted.\" Halal food is prepared according to religious rules for Muslims, but 80 percent of the food comes from non-Muslim countries and companies, according to South Korea.

Chung Ui-hwa, the Speaker of South Korea\u2019s National Assembly, proposed the plan to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner last week. Chung was to discuss it at the Center for Strategic & International Studies last Saturday until snowstorms canceled the event. Boehner called it a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d But writing the resolution may spark unexpected disagreements between and within both countries, as it would be forced to mention, or ignore sensitive issues such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, Japan\u2019s World War II atrocities and territorial disputes.\u201cThe letter will praise the relative peace in Northeast Asia over the past 70 years after World War II, which gave rise to prosperous economies in China, South Korea and Japan,\u201d a South Korean parliamentary source familiar with the proposal said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\u201cThe resolution will urge North Korea to forfeit its nuclear weapons, and the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas,\u201d the source added, noting it could also ask Japan and its neighbors to \u201cresolve disagreements\u201d over history.The source said it was uncertain if the resolution would explicitly mention the comfort women issue. It was also highly unlikely to mention territorial disagreements among Japan and its neighbors.Many in China and South Korea have been demanding Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reissue \u201cmore sincere\u201d apologies for Imperial Japan\u2019s sexual imprisonment of thousands of Asian women during the war, euphemistically known as the comfort women issue.Abe\u2019s apparent denials of the atrocities have sparked anger among Chinese and South Koreans, and worsened ties among the nations. Territorial disputes between Japan and China over islands in the East China Sea, and Japan\u2019s contestation of a set of islets held by South Korea have worsened the situation. The U.S. is expected to be reluctant to take actions that could provoke Japan, a key ally, by openly siding with South Korea and China in the issues of such a resolution, analysts have said.Chung\u2019s potential resolution could also spark protest from constituents in South Korea, who could ask for much stronger wording in any joint resolution with the U.S., against North Korea.If the U.S. ultimately declines to write the joint resolution, South Korea\u2019s legislature is considering writing an exclusive one before Aug. 15, the date marking the end of World War II and Korea\u2019s liberation from Japan\u2019s 35-year occupation of the country.Discussions on the details of the resolution have been initiated by Chung and the foreign affairs committee chief of the South Korean Assembly, Rep. Na Kyung-won, according to Assembly sources.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","735":"A Seoul court deemed a decision by the immigration office to deny a refugee status application to be unlawful, court records showed Sunday, allowing the asylum seeker to apply for protection more than a year after he came to South Korea. \"Despite any suspicion (the Incheon Immigration Office) might have, asylum seekers should be given the opportunity to be evaluated for refugee status and be provided with permissible legal protection while going through the necessary procedure,\" the Seoul High Court ruling said. In late 2013, a fugitive running from conscription in his war-ridden home country in Africa was denied the right to apply for sanctuary here on grounds that there were inconsistencies in his account.The man, whose identity has been withheld, spent the next year taking legal action against the Incheon Immigration Office and went through several appeals trials in the process to seek a chance to enter the country and have his application for refugee status submitted for evaluation.Immigration officials decided not to appeal the latest outcome, making the ruling final and the first case to reverse the immigration office's decision to deny an asylum seeker's application for refugee status. \"We hope the authorities will work to bring a groundbreaking change to the immigration system,\" said an attorney who represented the defendant.\u00a0 \"The country needs to improve its immigration system and have it updated in line with its Refugee Law,\" he added. Earlier in 2013, the Justice Ministry revised the Refugee Law to provide financial aid to those applying for refugee status.Under the amended law, applicants awaiting their outcome are given living costs or are allowed to stay at a facility for up to six months after submitting their applications.Last year, 2,896 foreigners sought asylum in South Korea, of which 94 were accepted, according to the Korea Immigration Service.The figure does not include those from North Korea.

In November, Park told Al Thani that the two sides can develop ties beyond energy and construction to health care, defense and information and communication technology.Middle East countries are pushing to diversify their economies, which are heavily dependent on oil, ahead of the inevitable advent of a post-oil era. South Korea believes that such attempts could present new business opportunities for its companies.South Korea in recent years has emerged as one of the most-favored destinations for foreigners who seek medical treatment.In 2013, more than 3,500 people from the Middle East visited South Korea on medical tours, up 54 percent from the previous year, according to data released by South Korea's presidential office.Qatar plans to spend more than $100 billion to expand its infrastructure such as roads and accommodation facilities as well as stadiums to prepare for the 2022 World Cup, which Park said would present new business opportunities for South Korean companies.Qatar is South Korea's No. 1 supplier of natural gas and fifth-largest supplier of crude oil.Earlier this week, Park also visited Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

After effectively concluding free trade negotiations last November, South Korea and China completed the \"initialing\" of the deal last month, marking one step closer to the official signing. Both sides voiced their hope to sign the deal within the first half of this year. Gao described the free trade deal with South Korea as a \"high-standard,\" saying it will significantly boost bilateral trade between the two nations.

Their unit is known as \"Ahk,\" an Arabic word meaning \"brother.\"It is the second time that Park has given a pep talk to the Ahk unit in less than a year.She met about 10 soldiers of the Ahk unit in May when she visited the UAE to attend a ceremony marking the installation of a Korean-built nuclear reactor at a power plant under construction in Barakah, some 300 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi.It is the first out of four reactors South Korea plans to provide the UAE under a 2009 deal worth US$20.4 billion that marked South Korea's first export of nuclear reactors.On Thursday, Park met with the Abu Dhabi crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said the construction of a nuclear power plant \"has become a good starting point for the two countries to welcome the next hundred years,\" according to Park's office.Also Friday, Park met with about 30 South Korean doctors and nurses working in four hospitals in the UAE.Health care has emerged as a new promising area of cooperation between South Korea and the Middle Eastern countries. A health promotion center managed by Seoul's St. Mary's Hospital opened downtown in the oil-rich capital of Abu Dhabi earlier in the day.The move came weeks after the Sheikh Khalifa Specialist Hospital opened in the UAE under a consignment deal with Seoul National University Hospital, one of South Korea's top medical centers.Mohammed bin Zayed told Park that he trusts South Korea in the health care sector and said he would be pleased if more South Korean doctors and nurses come to his Gulf state.More than 1,150 UAE nationals came to South Korea for medical treatments in 2013, costing the wealthy Gulf state US$18 million, according to South Korean data.Later in the day, Park plans to fly to Qatar, the last stop on her four-nation swing that also included Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

Analysts had predicted the scandal would give easy wins to NPAD candidates running in the four contested districts in Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju, and Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.The NPAD\u2019s most surprising loss was to independent candidate Chun Jung-bae in Gwangju, a region long considered an NPAD stronghold. Chun is an ex-NPAD official who left the party in February after twice failing to secure a spot as a party candidate in Gwangju \u2015 first in last July\u2019s parliamentary by-elections and in the by-elections last week.Moon flew to Gwangju on Monday to meet voters for the first time since the electoral defeat to Chun, reportedly appealing to former NPAD voters who had turned their backs on the polls.

(AFP)","742":"U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert was in good condition overall on Friday and is expected to have his stitches removed early next week from injuries inflicted by a South Korean assailant.Wielding a 25-centimeter knife, Kim Ki-jong slashed the ambassador five times, including a deep gash on his face that extends from his right chin to cheek. Thursday's attack happened at a performance hall in downtown Seoul where the envoy was to give a speech. The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Kim, 55, said he carried out the attack because he was unhappy about the ongoing military drills between South Korea and the U.S., which he said hampered progress in inter-Korean relations. The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises kicked off earlier this week and are intended to thwart North Korean aggression.Doctors at Yonsei University's Severance Hospital, where Lippert underwent surgery right after the attack, had said there was no irreversible damage to key facial organs like the nerves and salivary glands. There was, however, a minor injury to the nerves in his left pinkie, which they said should recover in about six months to a year.Yoon Do-heum, head of the hospital, said the stitches on his face will be taken out either on Monday or Tuesday and doctors will watch the envoy for another day or two before deciding when he may leave the hospital.Yoon said Lippert barely felt pain in his face, which was the most seriously injured, but told him his left arm and fingers continued to hurt.\"But this kind of pain should go away in about two to three days,\" Yoon told reporters in a briefing.The envoy has had no problems moving around within his room, although he wasn't able to sleep until 3 a.m., Yoon said.At one point, Lippert's temperature rose to 37.7 degrees Celsius but has stabilized to normal levels. There were no signs of infections, but the doctors will keep an eye on his temperature to make sure there are no complications, he added.Yoon also said Lippert thanked the doctors in Korean and wanted to express thanks to the South Koreans who looked out for him.Lippert told the doctors he had slept well despite having only gotten four hours of sleep. Yoon said the ambassador appeared to be in better mental condition than the doctors, asking them if they were doing fine.The envoy had previously written on his Twitter account that he was \"doing well and in good spirits.\" \"Will be back ASAP (as soon as possible) to advance US-ROK alliance!\" he wrote, using the acronym of South Korea's official name, Republic of Korea.Lippert became the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to Seoul last year.

(Yonhap)","744":"Family members of former Korean President Chun Doo-hwan agreed to forfeit assets of more than $1 million laundered in the U.S., as a result of a joint probe by the two countries to seize the funds, U.S. authorities said Thursday. The U.S. Department of Justice said that it had reached a settlement in the forfeiture case involving assets worth $1.2 million belonging to Chun\u2019s family, including a house at Newport Beach, California, and an investment made in a Philadelphia limited partnership. The U.S. has supported the Korean authorities\u2019 efforts to recover Chun\u2019s illegal assets since July 2013 as part of Washington\u2019s new measures to recover the proceeds of foreign official corruption, U.S. authorities said. Earlier last year, the ally assisted Seoul in collecting $28.7 million that Chun had concealed in the States. \u201cThe U.S. will not idly stand by and serve as a money-laundering haven for foreign officials to hide corrupt activities,\u201d FBI Assistant Director in Charge David Bowdich said. Chun, a former army general who led the 1979 coup and controlled the country until 1988, was sentenced to life in prison for corruption, mutiny and treason in 1995. After being pardoned in 1997, the disgraced former president was ordered to pay 220.5 billion won ($200.4 million) in penalties but paid only one-fourth of the total. Five months before the statute of limitations on collecting Chun\u2019s fines was to expire in October 2013, the Korean prosecution launched an investigation into Chun and his family to seize the unpaid fines of 167 billion won. Prosecutors detained a younger brother of the disgraced ex-president\u2019s wife over tax evasion and grilled Chun\u2019s second son, who was suspected of using his father\u2019s slush fund. The National Assembly also supported the investigators\u2019 move by revising a law to better collect fines through uncovering hidden assets of public officials. Chun\u2019s family made a public apology in September 2013 and vowed to pay the rest of the fines through selling real estate, paintings and other assets. As of this month, Chun still has about 119 billion won to pay, the Korean authorities said. Investigators said they would continue to seek Chun\u2019s concealed property. U.S. judiciary officials will turn over the forfeited money to Korea soon, officials said.By Lee Hyun-jeong\u00a0(rene@heraldcorp.com)","745":"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that Beijing will spare no effort to formally sign a bilateral free trade agreement with South Korea \"as soon as possible.\" After effectively concluding free trade negotiations last November, South Korea and China completed the \"initialing\" of the deal last month, marking one step closer to the official signing.Both sides voice their hope to sign the deal within the first half of this year.

Since its latest nuclear test, North Korea has demanded that the six-party talks should be resumed without any preconditions. But Seoul and Washington stressed that Pyongyang should first demonstrate its willingness to denuclearize. Established in 1979, the Conference on Disarmament is a multilateral forum to negotiate arms control and disarmament. This year's conference kicked off on Jan. 19 and will run until March 27. (Yonhap)","747":"The Welfare Ministry on Monday said 30,000 more assisting nannies will be assigned to public day care centers suffering from a chronic workforce shortage, as part of the long-term measures to enhance child welfare and prevent abuses.Currently, a single assisting nanny is appointed for every four day care workers caring for children aged from 3 to 5 at state-run centers. Under the Child Welfare Law of Korea, a single day care worker is allowed to take care of a maximum of three babies aged less than a year old at a time. One nanny is allowed to care for up to five 1-year-olds, seven 2-year-olds, 15 3-year-olds and 20 children aged four or older.Many experts in the field have said that the current law is putting too much pressure on day care workers, claiming it is especially difficult for a single nanny to take care of three to seven babies at the same time. \u201cEven mothers say it\u2019s difficult to take care of a single child all day long,\u201d said Park Chun-hwa, a day care worker in Seoul. \u201cBut day care workers have to care for as many as seven babies to 20 children, all at the same time. The maximum number of children a single worker is allowed to care for should be cut to half of what it is stipulated in the laws now.\u201dOverseas studies have long shown that stress influences a care worker\u2019s behavior toward his or her patients or children. Most institutional abuses are the result of difficult or stressful working environments, according to a 1997 study by Cornell University. In overstressed situations, power over patients or children can bring feelings of control and importance to care workers, according to the same study.To tackle the issue, the Welfare Ministry plans to increase the number of assisting nannies to help day care workers, particularly those looking after babies aged up to 2. Up until now, workers who take care of infants aged up to two were not eligible to receive help from assisting nannies. There are currently some 6,600 assisting nannies helping day care workers care for children aged 3 to 5 nationwide. The Welfare Ministry plans to expand the number to 36,600.The ministry will also hire some 3,000 more substitute nannies to replace staff when he or she is required to attend a job training session or situations of emergency arise. Up until now, substitutes were only allowed to fill in when a staff worker is on his or her honeymoon or on their vacation. In emergency situations, coworkers, not a substitute, had to fill his or her space.Currently, there are only about 450 substitute nannies employed nationwide.The government has been preparing measures to curb child abuse following a series of controversial cases that rocked the country earlier this year.In January, a daycare worker in Incheon was caught on CCTV footage beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal. Nationwide concern about child abuse by child care workers erupted thereafter.Last week, the National Assembly passed a bill requiring all child care centers to install surveillance cameras and keep the recordings for at least 60 days. The bill also states that the government should provide counseling services and increase the number of day care workers, as their heavy workload and stress together have been often cited as a cause of child abuse at child care facilities.The Welfare Ministry estimates some $190 billion won ($176.1 million) would be needed to hire substitute and assistant nannies.Day care worker Park, however, said installation of surveillance cameras may make it harder for the child care staff to discipline the children. \u201cSince many parents are extremely anxious after the Incheon abuse case, a lot of them already tell us not to make things that their children don\u2019t want to do, even if it\u2019s about cleaning the table after finishing an art class,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is necessarily a good thing for children and their development.\u201dBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","748":"Rival parties moved to amend a newly passed anti-corruption law Wednesday amid mounting questions over its scope and constitutionality.The move comes just a day after the National Assembly passed the bill despite controversy over its possible violation of individuals' constitutional rights and what critics argued could be excessive legislation.The bill's hasty passage is widely seen as an attempt by lawmakers to please voters ahead of next year's parliamentary elections as public demand for the legislation has been high in a country where corruption involving public officials causes national outrage.The so-called Kim Young-ran Law, named after the former Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief who proposed the legislation in June 2011, subjects public officials, journalists and private school faculty to a maximum penalty of three years in prison or a fine of five times the amount they accept in money or valuables, if they take money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($908) from one person in one installment, regardless of whether it is in exchange for favors or related to their work. For gifts that are work-related and worth 1 million won or less, the penalty is a fine of up to five times the gift's value.The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.On Wednesday, both the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy acknowledged the need to review the details of the law.\"We will humbly listen to all opinions about loopholes or side effects and in the one and a half years of preparation, if there is a need to supplement the legislation, we will do so,\" Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the floor leader of the ruling party, said during a party meeting.The ruling party especially raised concerns about excluding civic groups from those subject to the law and the vagueness of what constitutes an illegal request for a favor.The main opposition party, meanwhile, expressed concern about the possibility of \"targeted investigations\" by prosecutors and the police, and excessive legislation.\"There must be parallel efforts to build an institutional guarantee against the prosecution's abuse of authority through prosecution reforms,\" Rep. Kang Gi-jung, NPAD's chief policymaker, said in a phone interview with Yonhap News Agency.In a press conference at the main government complex in Seoul, the ACRC's current chief, Lee Sung-bo, vowed to do all he can to ensure the new law takes root at an early date.\"We will work hard to resolve the controversy by supplementing the areas the public is concerned about in the process of drawing up relevant enforcement ordinances and rules,\" he said. \"We will do our best to ensure that this law, which carries the people's desire for integrity, becomes a new milestone that makes our society more transparent and clean.\"A survey conducted by polling agency Realmeter showed that 64 percent of those surveyed approved of the bill's passage. The survey was conducted on 500 adults on Tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.The bill's passage had been delayed amid wrangling over various details, including a clause that requires public officials to report a family member's acceptance of a bribe.Critics argued that the clause infringes on the constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience and destroys family relationships.Ahead of the bill's passage, the rival parties agreed to keep that clause but limit the scope of another clause to apply the law only to public officials and their spouses, not their other family members. The official, not the spouse, would be subject to the relevant punishment.The parties also agreed to allow an 18-month grace period for enforcement of the law from the date of its proclamation.Last year, South Korea climbed three notches in an international corruption awareness ranking to 43rd out of 175 countries, according to Transparency International, the Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog.South Korea scored 55 out of 100 in the 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, with high scores meaning low corruption.

The 678-megawatt reactor had run for commercial use for 30 years before that.Two environmental civic groups including Friends of the Earth Korea said South Korea approved the extension without reevaluating the reactor's safety according to the standards used by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The last evaluation was conducted 33 years ago, the groups said.\"The government should re-assess whether to extend the life of the nuclear reactor by considering its safety, public views towards it, and economic viability,\" Suh Kune-yull, a Seoul National University nuclear engineering professor said. \"If the overall assessment is negative, there's no need to re-activate the reactor.\"Yang Iwon-young, an environmental activist, said the Wolsong-1 has not passed the stress test as President Park Geun-hye promised during her election campaign.\"We will see if the government remembers the lesson from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011,\" she said.In a controversial decision on Feb. 27, the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission extended the operation of the Wolsong-1 nuclear reactor until 2022, drawing strong opposition from residents and environmental groups over its safety.South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply. The resource-poor country is building several more as its industries rely heavily on imported energy.

About 56 percent of the capital\u2019s taxis are private, it said.Of them, about 31 percent of the drivers are over the age of 65, with 12 percent being 70 or older.While 35,000 of the private taxies are obligated to operate daily, only 48 percent, or 16,931 of them are running nightshifts due to worries over their safety on the road, the data said.The older the drivers were, the less they worked at night, the data added. While more than half of those aged 50 or younger went to work at night, only 24 percent of those in their 70s did so. The city said that such low participation in nighttime taxi driving derived from the aged drivers\u2019 concerns over accident risks. According to data from the city authorities, just 22 percent of taxi-related accidents from 2010 to last year involved drivers aged 65 or older. However, the number of car accidents by older aged drivers in general jumped to some 15,000 cases in 2012, nearly fivefold that of 2001. \u201cThe accident rate of aged drivers is usually higher than the average. When accidents take place, they also tend to face a hike in insurance fees, (making cab drivers reluctant to work at night),\u201d Seoul officials said. In an effort to alleviate the cab accident concerns by aged drivers, Seoul City has suggested that the Transport Ministry limit the cab drivers\u2019 age to 65. But several legislation attempts in the past died due to a backlash from the cab industry, the city said.

South Korea and China completed the \"initialing\" of the deal last month, marking a step closer to the official signing, after declaring \"substantial conclusion\" of their free trade talks last November. South Korea and China have been translating the English-language text of the deal into both Korean and Chinese, Gao said. \"Formal signing of the deal can take place within the first-half of this year,\" Gao was quoted as saying. Under the deal, South Korea and China will remove tariffs on about 90 percent of goods traded between the two nations over the next two decades. However, rice and autos were excluded from the deal. Two-way trade between South Korea and China totaled US$228.9 billion in 2013. (Yonhap)","752":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday cited North Korea as an example of failed denuclearization efforts, stressing that Iran could also end up possessing nuclear bombs like the communist nation.Speaking before a joint session of U.S. Congress, Netanyahu emphatically implored the United States to reject a deal being negotiated with Iran, denouncing it as a \"very bad deal\" that would allow Tehran to legitimately possess enriched uranium that can be used in building nuclear weapons.\"Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn't stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb,\" Netanyahu said. \"Now, we're warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs.\"Netanyahu was referring to a recent estimate by U.S. experts that Pyongyang's nuclear stockpile could expand from the current 10-16 nuclear weapons to as many as 100 bombs by 2020. \"Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors ... Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras. Now, I know this is not going to come as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them,\" he said.Netanyahu claimed that the deal currently being negotiated with Iran would leave what he called \"the foremost sponsor of global terrorism\" just \"weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy.\"Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted, Netanyahu said, adding that the current deal would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a \"real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal,\" he said.\"My friends, for over a year, we've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It's a very bad deal. We're better off without it,\" he said. \"Now we're being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That's just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.\"(Yonhap)","753":"The National Assembly on Tuesday passed a landmark anticorruption bill \u2015 ending years of partisan fighting over the details \u2015 that aims to bar all public servants and their spouses as well as journalists and teachers from receiving kickbacks. The National Assembly voted 226 to four, with 17 abstaining, passing the Kim Young-ran bill, named after the former Supreme Court Justice and ex-chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission who initially proposed it.According to the new law, it will be illegal for officials or their spouses to take more than 1 million won ($908), or an equal amount of gifts, in kickbacks. Those who take less than 1 million won will be fined. Journalists, teachers and civil servants will also be subject to the restrictions. Officials will be obligated to report kickbacks suspected to have been taken by their husbands or wives.Monetary kickbacks will encompass all financial benefits including money, marketable securities, real estate, goods, accommodation vouchers, memberships or coupons.\u00a0 Public servants leave the government complex in central Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Providing entertainment including eating out, drinking or playing golf will be restricted up to an amount to be set by a follow-up presidential decree. Honorariums for public servants delivering speeches at seminars or writing contributory articles will also be restricted to a certain amount.The court will be in charge of imposing punishments.The law will take effect 18 months after it is approved by the Cabinet, which is likely to take place this month.Tuesday\u2019s vote came after a compromise between the floor leaders of the governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy late Monday, wrapping up years of wrangling among legislators on the bill\u2019s details.The first draft, proposed in June 2011, suggested making it illegal for officials or their family members to take a material gift, however small. The bill enjoyed widespread public support, but lawmakers were slow to legislate it, saying the first draft was overly inclusive and harsh.Christmas presents such as game consoles or chocolates could be considered kickbacks according to the draft, critical lawmakers said. The bill could apply to up to 20 million citizens, in a country of 50 million, they added, as the bill included officials\u2019 extended families.But public pressure to pass the bill has been mounting since a ferry disaster last April killed over 300, mostly high school students. Known as the Sewol disaster, the accident was mainly caused by relaxed safety oversight over the sunken ferry\u2019s equipment by maritime officials who took kickbacks from the ship\u2019s owners, initial probes showed. Some lawmakers had taken similar bribes, prosecutors alleged.In January, the Assembly\u2019s National Policy Committee came up with a bipartisan revision to the bill similar to the final version.But parties had disagreed over details until the last minute, such as whether officials and their families would be obligated to report on each other, the scope of family members that would be affected by the bill and the amount of kickbacks that would be considered illegal.Debate is likely to continue over the scope of the bill, mainly over the possibility of excessive control by the authorities. Watchers also criticized the bill for omitting clauses directly relevant to incumbent lawmakers.Saenuri Rep. Kweon Seong-dong claimed the bill would cause distrust within families of public servants. He also alleged authorities could abuse the bill to conduct one-sided investigations into political opponents of an incumbent administration.Other bills were passed in Tuesday\u2019s plenary session, including one aiming to facilitate crowdfunding for start-ups and another extending the central government\u2019s subsidy for the Hub City of Asian Culture project in Gwangju, among others. The HCAC is a 5.3 trillion won plan to build new libraries, theaters and research centers for the fine arts in South Korea\u2019s sixth most populous city.Parties also agreed to set up a special committee to remap voting districts before next year\u2019s parliamentary elections. The Constitutional Court last October had ruled current electoral maps were unconstitutional, as some populous regions were underrepresented in the Assembly.The antigraft bill\u2019s supporters hope it will raise the public\u2019s trust in government here. South Korea\u2019s public trust levels in officialdom fell from 45 percent in 2013 to 33 percent last year, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual tally reported by Edelman, the world\u2019s largest independently owned public relations firm.South Korea\u2019s fall was one of the largest of the 27 measured countries, as the nation ranked 21st overall. The average trust level was 48 percent.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","754":"Rival political parties agreed Monday on the details of a controversial anti-corruption bill following months of wrangling over whether it violates an individual's constitutional rights, among other issues.The so-called Kim Young-ran Law, named after the former Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief who proposed the legislation in August 2012, was a top priority during February's extra parliamentary session ending on Tuesday. Under Monday's bipartisan deal, the bill will be passed through a plenary session on Tuesday.The new law will subject public officials, journalists and private school teachers to a maximum penalty of three years in prison or five times the amount they accepted in money or valuables if they take money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($908) from one person in one installment, regardless of whether it was in exchange for favors or related to their work.Passage of the bill has been delayed amid wrangling over its details, including a clause that requires public officials to report a family member's acceptance of a bribe.Critics have argued that the clause violates the freedom of conscience and destroys family relationships.On Monday, the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy agreed to remove that clause and limit the scope of another clause to apply the law only to an individual's spouse, not their immediate and extended family members.The parties also agreed to allow a 18-month grace period for enforcement of the law from the date of its passage as proposed by the government.The bill, which is designed to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules, stirred up a heated debate about whether it would make civil servants reluctant to perform their duties from fear of punishment.(Yonhap)","755":"Educational Testing Service held the 2015 TOEIC Global Leadership Program for college students from Feb. 27-28, providing them consultations and lectures on business skills, officials said Monday.A total of 42 students \u2015 who were picked based on their school grades, TOEIC scores and an essay \u2015 received training courses on skills like teamwork and leadership.

South Korea is the only country that has scattered such leaflets insulting the dignity and regime of a receiving nation, the website said, adding that the launch of anti-Pyongyang leaflets during the South Korea-U.S. military drill amounts to triggering a war.The North has strongly protested leaflet launches by some South Korean activists, sometimes firing back at such campaigns that were launched from a border town in the South.\"Leaflet scattering is a clear war aggression in the international law,\" Uriminzokkiri said, threatening that all the responsibility for such campaigns will be taken by the South. Despite prolonged inter-Korean feuding over the leaflet issue, the South Korean government has largely remained inactive, saying that the campaign is part of the activists' right to free speech. The rival Koreas remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.(Yonhap)","757":"All guns will be required to have GPS tracking devices on them while individuals will be banned from possessing live ammunition or small air rifles, government and ruling party officials said Monday.The measures come after two gunmen opened fire in two separate shooting incidents last week, killing a total of six people and themselves.Civilians are rarely armed with guns in South Korea. Only those with genuine reasons, such as hunting or target shooting, are allowed to own one, and it must be stored at police substations. Shooting incidents in South Korea, which are rare, have commonly involved military personnel, as all able-bodied men in South Korea are trained how to use guns during their mandatory military service.Government and ruling Saenuri Party officials met to discuss ways to strengthen gun control and agreed to restrict storage of guns to only police stations with jurisdiction over a gun owner's registered address or hunting grounds. Currently, guns can be stored at any police station across the nation.Live ammunition will be available for purchase only near hunting grounds, while any unused ammunition will have to be returned to police stations overseeing the grounds.Currently, guns can be taken out of any police station across the country and those carrying guns are free to go wherever they like. Civilians have also been allowed to possess air rifles with a caliber of 5.5 millimeters or under and up to 400 live bullets.

He is one of a select number who continuously served as a close aide to Park during the 2007 and 2012 presidential campaigns.The main opposition party, in particular, point to his immediate previous position of spy chief, calling the designation of the incumbent NIS chief to the central post for state affairs \u201can unprecedented, inappropriate personnel policy.\u201dLee is the first spymaster to be appointed to the chief of presidential staff since the naming of Park Gye-won during the Park Chung-hee military regime, 37 years ago.Lee also worked for the Lee Hoi-chang camp during the 2002 presidential election.Cheong Wa Dae has predicted that he will increase communication with the ruling party, the opposition and the public, citing his negotiation skills.

The two countries\u2019 foreign ministries held the fourth session of consultation in Seoul last March after 11 dormant years. During last year\u2019s general-director-level meeting, the two sides exchanged views on issues of common interest: increasing the visit of high-level delegates; establishing legal institutions for trade and investment; holding bilateral economic forums; cooperating at international bodies; and facilitating official development assistance. \u201cKorea\u2019s successful development from the ashes of the Korean War (1950-53) provides a great model of progress for Sudan,\u201d Abdelaal said. \u201cWe appreciate Korea\u2019s contribution in providing human resources, education and capacity-building.\u201d\u00a0Sudanese Ambassador Mohamed AbdelaalSudan and Korea established consular relations in 1976 and diplomatic relations in 1977. Abdelaal was hopeful that Sudanese natural resources could be combined with Korean capital and technology. He suggested energy, agriculture, food, textiles and leather, petrochemicals and metals as potential areas of investment. Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Hyundai Motors are currently operating in Sudan and bilateral trade volume reached $300 million in 2013, according to the embassy.Sudan and South Sudan have an estimated 6.8 billion barrels of oil reserves, of which more than 75 percent belongs to South Sudan. As the country\u2019s main export, oil has helped Sudan\u2019s economy grow at more than 4 percent a year since 2010.Chinese, Malaysian and Indian state oil companies have formed a consortium with their Sudanese counterpart Sudapet for the production, refinery and export of petroleum. No Korean companies have invested in Sudan\u2019s oil sector.\u201cSudan also has abundant natural resources, agricultural land, fresh water supply and livestock,\u201d the ambassador said. Agriculture makes up a third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, employing 80 percent of the workforce. South Sudan declared independence from its northern neighbor, Sudan, after nearly six decades of civil war that killed more than 2 million people. But a power struggle between South Sudan\u2019s President Salva Kiir and first Vice President Riek Machar, has plunged South Sudan into violence since early last year, with 1.2 million refugees and 850,000 internally displaced persons. After a request from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Korea dispatched a 270-member contingent of military engineers and medics to South Sudan in August 2013. They have provided peacekeeping assistance as part of the U.N. mission in Bor, Jonglei state.Korea recognized South Sudan\u2019s sovereignty and established ambassador-level diplomatic relations in July 2011.\u201cThere are still post-independence issues that need to be settled between Sudan and South Sudan particularly marking the border and arranging security,\u201d the ambassador explained, adding that the two governments now had friendly relations. \u201cThere is close security coordination under the auspices of the two presidents, but the presence of some rebel groups in South Sudan remains an obstacle to fully normalizing our relations,\u201d he said.Sudan has been hit by U.S. economic sanctions since late 2006, after it denied access to joint African Union-U.N. peacekeeping forces in the Darfur region. The embassy explained that the U.S. has lifted some sanctions to allow agricultural produce, food and communications hardware and software into the country since 2013.

As a diplomat, he also worked at the Korean embassies in Switzerland and Kenya.But the new chief of staff is expected to draw fierce criticism from the opposition party.\u00a0He was attacked by the opposition over allegations that he had delivered massive funds to the election camp of Lee Hoi-chang, the presidential candidate of the Grand National Party, the predecessor to the Saenuri Party, in 2002. His accumulation of wealth is also likely to be an issue.\u00a0As Lee is leaving his post at the NIS after just eight months, this could also create a vacuum in South Korea\u2019s diplomatic and security team, critics say.After the announcement was made, Lee said he had declined to take the post several times but accepted the offer due to his affection for the country.\u201cI feel grave responsibility to take the post in this difficult time,\u201d he said.For her special advisors for political affairs, Park named three lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party -- Reps. Yoon Sang-hyun, Joo Ho-young and Kim Jae-won. Former legislator Kim Kyung-jae was also appointed as special presidential advisor for public relations and Kim Seong-woo, former TV journalist, as her new senior press secretary.NIS chief-nominee Lee Byung-ho will be subjected to a confirmation hearing, though no parliamentary vote is required.\u201cFor 26 years, Lee served various posts at the NIS including second deputy chief and team head of international affairs, which allowed him to gain rich experience and professionalism,\u201d said Min.

The country's key policy rate currently stands at a record low of 2 percent. \u00a0\u00a0The Korea Housing Finance Corp. will issue mortgage-backed securities to fund the new loans.\u00a0\u00a0The size and soundness of household borrowing has come under serious question as the amount has ballooned while the country's economy has yet to show definitive signs of picking up.

The figure passed the 1,000 trillion won mark for the first time in the third quarter last year.\u00a0\u00a0Of total family loans extended by banks, mortgage-backed loans accounted for 70 percent as of end-December.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The pace of gains in household credit has sped up since August, when the government eased rules on mortgage loans to stimulate the sagging property market. The central bank chipped in by lowering its policy rate twice in the second half of the year.\u00a0\u00a0The prevalent view of policymakers is that while the loans are high in numbers, they have not yet hit a dangerous level.\u00a0\u00a0Experts, however, say they have and that stopgap measures would not solve the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\"The authorities acknowledge that household debt is risky and is a time bomb for the South Korean economy,\" Park Chang-kyun, a professor at Chung-ang University, said. \"But it's just a political metaphor to say that household debt can be controlled.\"\u00a0\u00a0\"The government has lifted loan-related regulations and induced people to get more loans beyond their ability to repay.

The president has also been calling for public support for her reform drive, stressing that the New Year is the \u201clast golden time\u201d to push ahead with the plan. Contrary to her wishes, Park now faces a political crisis with questions building over her authoritative, top-down leadership, which remains unchanged despite constant demands from the public.A series of political scandals involving conflicts between groups of aides as well as the government\u2019s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance has damaged her credibility.\u00a0President Park Geun-hye attends a lunch meeting with a group of business tycoons on corporate support for culture at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Tuesday.

(Yonhap)Presidential documents were leaked to media late last year, raising speculation over lax discipline within Cheong Wa Dae. Park also came under fire after she refused to abandon her aides involved in a related influence-peddling scandal.She continued to struggle over her tax policies as the government backtracked on its initial plan to revise the tax settlement scheme in the face of public worries that the middle class would have to pay more.Her approval ratings plummeted to below 30 percent on Jan. 27, the lowest rating since she entered office. According to local pollster Realmeter, her job ratings quickly rebounded to 36 percent last week. But the score is still far lower than when her leadership was questioned in the wake of the Sewol ferry accident. Critics say that her second year was \u201cfull of disappointment,\u201d noting that she should have reached out more to the public and given more leeway to the Cabinet to actively work on her reform drives.\u201cPark handled foreign affairs relatively well during her second year but failed entirely on home affairs, particularly on her promise to bring about national unity,\u201d said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.Yoon stressed that the people started to \u201cfeel heavy\u201d due to perceptions that she is an uncommunicative leader.\u201cPeople have suffered from economic downturns for many years, not just this time,\u201d Yoon said.\u201cIt is the leadership that gives hopes to the people in times of difficulty. But with Park, a president only reads reports day and night alone at the presidential office, people started to feel distanced from her and give up seeking hope from her.\u201dLast week, Park appointed a new prime minister and conducted a partial Cabinet reshuffle, as part of her efforts to restore public confidence. With a new lineup, however, the president needs to keep her pledge to share more responsibility with the prime minister and minsters by allowing them greater discretion in decision-making and personnel choices, said Yoon of Hanshin University.But experts say she may have already lost her opportunity to push ahead with her reform drive.\u201cI think she put too much focus on diplomacy during her first two years in office,\u201d said Choi Young-jin, a political science professor at ChungAng University in Seoul. Choi lashed out by saying that she enjoyed \u201cCinderella moments\u201d through introducing her mantra of a creative economy and trustpolitik, the centerpiece of her North Korean policies, during her series of presidential trips.\u201cShe missed the right time to push ahead with her reform efforts and other major agendas such as restructuring the public servants\u2019 pension system and health insurance. Now is too late,\u201c he said. Despite the pessimistic views, Yoon Hee-woong, head of public opinion research firm Min Consulting, said it was too early to say she had entered lame duck status.\u201cThe possibility is still high that Park will restore public confidence, as she and her governing party hold a strong and loyal base of conservative supporters,\u201d he said. The Saenuri Party currently holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament.As for inter-Korean relations, Park has been praised for her principled approach to forging a normal state-to-state relationship with Pyongyang \u2015 rather than pampering a recalcitrant North with unconditional largesse.But she has also been criticized for being inflexible in breaking the prolonged cross-border impasse \u2015 a reason why calls have been mounting for her to be more active in tackling bilateral issues including the issue of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.Inter-Korean tensions have remained high due to the North\u2019s provocative behavior and menacing rhetoric. The North has constantly warned of retaliation against South Korean activists who send balloons filled with anti-Pyongyang leaflets to the North and demanded that Seoul and Washington cancel their allied military drills. Amid its verbal threats and shows of force, the impoverished North has also demanded that the South lift its economic sanctions against it, resume the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan and agree to reopen the multilateral aid-for-denuclearization talks without preconditions.Observers say that Park needs to devise creative options to defuse inter-Korean tensions and forge momentum to block Pyongyang from further developing its nuclear weapons, rather than rigidly calling for sincerity in the North\u2019s denuclearization commitments.On the wider diplomatic front, Park\u2019s pursuit of improved ties with Beijing has been hailed as foreign policy feat.In a departure from her predecessor\u2019s excessive focus on enhancing relations with the U.S., Park has sought to deepen and broaden the strategic partnership with China, a crucial partner for trade, tourism and efforts to denuclearize the North.At the same time, Park has made strong efforts to maintain the traditional security alliance with the U.S.Through the conclusion of free trade negotiations with China, Seoul has strengthened its economic partnership with Beijing. It has also deepened its security cooperation to cope with the North through bilateral summits and various strategic dialogue channels.Over the course of just two years, Park has met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping six times and with Premier Li Keqiang once, which analysts say reflects the closer partnership she has built with the emergent Asian power.But the improved relations with Beijing have also posed a diplomatic challenge to Seoul. Amid the intensifying strategic competition between the U.S. and China, the South was forced to make tough strategic choices on several occasions.China has pressured the South not to allow the U.S.\u2019 deployment of an additional missile defense asset to the peninsula and to participate in the scheme to establish the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which the U.S. sees as a move by China to exclude it and lead the regional financial order.Over recent years, the South\u2019s relationship with Japan has worsened due to Tokyo\u2019s failure to fully atone for its wartime misdeeds including its sexual enslavement of Asian women during World War II. Tokyo\u2019s continued claim to South Korea\u2019s easternmost islets of Dokdo has continued to be a source of diplomatic friction between the two neighbors.Experts say that although the public antagonism against Japan has worsened, Seoul should continue to pursue practical cooperation in security, business and other areas rather than being bound by the past.By Cho Chung-un, Song Sang-ho(christory@heraldcorp.com) (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","776":"South Korea and the U.S. plan to stage their annual joint military drills next month, the allies said Tuesday, as North Korea threatened a military response to what it called a \u201crehearsal for aggressive war.\u201d Key Resolve, a computer simulated command post exercise, will kick off on March 2 for a 12-day run, involving some 10,000 South Korean troops and 8,600 American servicemen.

Yellow dust advisories are issued when an hourly average dust concentration of more than 400 micrograms per cubic meter is expected to continue for more than two hours. More than 800 micrograms per cubic meter for over two hours triggers a warning. \u201cThe yellow dust, which originated from deserts in southern Mongolia and northern China, flew to the peninsula on a strong northwesterly wind, leading to thick yellow dust,\u201d the KMA said.

But contradictory tax policies and debates over constitutional reforms threaten to derail Park\u2019s proposed economic restructuring reforms.Many of Park\u2019s initiatives were initially welcomed by the public. Her catchphrase during the 2012 presidential race, \u201cwelfare without taxation,\u201d received particular applause. Support for her proposed reform of the national pension for retired civil servants has also been high.\u00a0 President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)Multiple polls dating back to last September have shown public support for the pension reforms ranging from 60 to 80 percent.Pension reforms could save the government up to 55 trillion won ($49.5 billion), government statistics show. Park has said that money could be used to finance her welfare policies.Scandals involving Park\u2019s top aides and former National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon have dominated debates in the National Assembly, though, impeding moves to discuss and legislate Park\u2019s proposed reforms. Park aides were accused of monopolizing access to the president, to the frustration of top Cabinet officials. Won is accused of having illegally swayed public opinion in the weeks leading up to the 2012 election by posting online comments. The tobacco tax hike last December likewise hindered Park\u2019s reforms by sparking a public uproar against her government, as the policy appeared to go against Park\u2019s pledges to increase welfare without increasing taxes. The public mood worsened in January when tax settlement calculations showed taxpayers this year would have to forfeit much of their returns or even pay more taxes.Many of the legislations considered \u201ccritical\u201d to Park\u2019s efforts to boost economic growth here have been left pending. These include the pension reforms, bills aiming to energize tourism and bills facilitating crowdfunding for start-ups.And although prosecutors found accusations against Park\u2019s aides \u201cfactually erroneous,\u201d public trust in the Park administration appears low. The Feb. 9 guilty ruling against Won by an appellate court in Seoul did not help.Gallup Korea reported that only 30 percent of the public supported Park as of Feb. 12, in a survey of 1,010 adults nationwide. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent on a 95 percent confidence level.\u201cPark must begin prioritizing policies, and seriously start thinking about what kind of president she wants to be remembered as,\u201d Seoul National University professor Kang Won-taek said.\u201cSimply reforming the pension for retired civil servants is going to be a big challenge,\u201d Hong-ik University professor Chung Goon-gi said. \u201cThe Park administration must become more efficient in its policymaking.\u201dBut prioritizing may not suffice for Park if rumors that lawmakers could begin discussing constitutional reforms in the coming months turn out true. Lawmakers have backed moves to reduce the president\u2019s power over domestic affairs by revising the Constitution.Analysts say any debate on such changes is likely to hijack discussion on Park\u2019s reforms, further lowering hopes for advocates of Park\u2019s reforms.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","786":"South Korean President Park Geun-hye plans to visit Saudi Arabia and three other Middle Eastern countries next month to discuss energy and security issues with their heads of state, the presidential office said Sunday.The nine-day trip to the Middle East, starting on March 1, will take Park first to Kuwait and then Saudi Arabia as well as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, according to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.

Indonesia is planning to host the Asian-African Conference from April 22-23 in Jakarta to be followed by a key ceremony in the Indonesian city of Bandung on April 24 to mark the 60th anniversary of the Bandung meeting in 1955. The nonaligned movement emerged from the 1955 gathering. A Taiwanese news outlet reported last month Kim may attend the April meeting, but it has yet to be confirmed. If Kim does so, it would be his first visit to a foreign country since abruptly taking power in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. The North Korean leader is also reportedly planning to join a ceremony in Moscow in May to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.The Indonesian government has also invited President Park Geun-hye to the April gathering although sources said she may not appear at the meeting due to scheduling conflicts. Still, the Indonesian meeting may draw heavy attention for the possibility of the North Korean leaders' contact with South Korean and Chinese officials, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and high-level South Korean diplomats expected to join the meeting. The communist North has apparently made much of the Bandung Conference, attempting to use it for diplomatic campaigns.The North's founding leader Kim Il-sung joined a 1965 ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the birth of the conference.

(Yonhap)","793":"A women\u2019s college in Seoul accused a member of its teaching staff of sexually abusing a student, sources said Monday, amid rising concerns over a series of similar cases reported in other schools. Last month, Duksung Women\u2019s University filed a police complaint against a professor, whose personal information has been withheld, for molesting a student. The professor is alleged to have forcibly kissed the student after drinking together early last year.\u00a0The school\u2019s unusually proactive response to the alleged sex crime could be a wake-up call for Korea\u2019s universities, as many have been perceived as slow to respond to similar cases, experts said. After finding out that there were other victims at the school, the victim filed a report with the college office in December. Duksung immediately conducted an internal probe and restricted the professor from contacting with the victim. She has been suffering from depression and insomnia since the incident, the school said. The school also secured an admission of wrongdoing from the professor, school officials said. In a police probe, however, he denied the charges, public investigators said. The police will summon the professor again soon, they added. The concerned faculty member was removed from his post earlier this month, the school said.Public anger has been high since a Seoul National University professor was indicted last year for sexually abusing students. Kang Seok-jin, a 53-year-old mathematics professor, was suspected of engaging in inappropriate physical contact with nine students between 2008 and 2014. He will face a second trial hearing next month. A national uproar was sparked after the school accepted Kang\u2019s resignation without imposing any penalties. Recognizing his resignation would allow Kang to receive severance and pension payments and automatically wrap up the university\u2019s internal probe into the case. As public criticism grew over the school\u2019s leniency, the school withdrew the decision. The prestigious public school came under fire again earlier this month when another faculty member was suspected of making inappropriate remarks to female students. While the school is investigating the reported incident, the concerned professor is denying all allegations, university officials said. In response to the series of sexual crimes, SNU students formed a student body called \u201cCommunal Action\u201d last week to better cope with sex offenses involving professors.The group will monitor the school\u2019s internal probes into sexual abuse cases and the punishment process for the involved teaching staff, students said. The new body will also directly receive reports from students to help them report their cases, they added. Many of the victims tend to shy away from reporting abuses by professors because of the teachers\u2019 authority and influence, CA said.

All five sitting lawmakers of the party immediately lost their seats in the parliament.The decision was based on the assumption that Lee Seok-ki, one of the UPP lawmakers, planned to overthrow the South Korean government in case of a war with North Korea.In a ruling that apparently contradicts this assumption, however, the Supreme Court last month partially sided with Lee, finding him not guilty of plotting a rebellion but guilty of encouraging other members of his secret organization to do so. The top court said there was no proof that such an organization existed.The UPP has latched onto this discrepancy as a basis for their request for retrial. Its legal representatives said they submitted the request earlier in the day.\"How the majority treats a minority shows how mature a democratic nation is,\" read the request. \"It's about time that South Korea returned to being the mature democracy that it once was.\"Last month, former UPP lawmakers filed a petition with the Seoul Administrative Court to reverse the constitutional ruling that resulted in their loss of parliamentary seats.Those designated as members of Lee's secret organization also filed a damages suit against the Constitutional Court, saying they'd been falsely accused.

SUV sales rose 12 percent to more than 5.5 million. That was double the pace of the industry as a whole.Strong demand is likely to continue this year, says Jesse Toprak, president of Toprak Consulting Group. SUV sales may not see double-digit growth, since overall sales are expected to slow as the U.S. market nears a peak of 17 million vehicles. But SUVs should still outpace sales of cars, Toprak says.Small SUVs like the Honda CR-V have been the fastest growing segment in the market for the last three years. They appeal to both young families and aging Baby Boomers. Low interest rates, easing credit standards and new versions of popular models like the Jeep Cherokee and Subaru Outback have also fueled demand.More recently, low gas prices helped boost sales of bigger SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Lincoln Navigator. Last June, when gas prices peaked at $3.76 per gallon, SUV sales made up 33 percent of new vehicle sales, while small cars made up 20 percent, according to Ward\u2019s AutoInfoBank. By December, when gas prices had fallen to $2.63, SUV market share rose to 35 percent, while small cars fell to 16 percent.Here are some of the SUVs debuting at the Chicago show, which opened to the public Saturday.General Motors is unveiling a refreshed Chevrolet Equinox small SUV. It\u2019s the first update to the Equinox since it went on sale in 2010, and it should help the popular SUV compete with newer rivals until it gets an expected redesign in late 2017. The 2016 Equinox will have a larger, handsomer, chrome-accented grille and upgraded projector-beam headlamps; on higher trim levels, the headlamps are LEDs. A rear-view camera will be standard on all models. Blind spot detection and cross-traffic alert are new options. Inside, there\u2019s a new standard 7-inch screen and an updated instrument panel. The Equinox has been a consistently strong seller despite its advancing age. Last year, Equinox sales rose 2 percent to 242,242, making it the fourth-best seller in the crowded small SUV market behind the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4.

Rep. Jin Sung-joon (Yonhap)Lee Wan-koo, former floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party tapped for the post, said during last week's confirmation hearing that he asked the National Assembly Secretariat to correct his assets report after learning that he mistakenly omitted his 2003 purchase of the Tower Palace apartment. Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance said the secretariat has confirmed this was not true.The opposition has raised suspicions that Lee had accepted illegal political funds in 2002 that could have been used to purchase the high-class apartment in southern Seoul and that the nominee omitted the property from his assets list to hide the source of the money.The fresh allegation was raised on the eve of the parliamentary plenary session during which lawmakers would vote on whether to approve Lee as prime minister.After the hearings, the rival parties agreed to postpone the vote, initially expected Thursday, to Monday. Since being nominated last month, Lee has come under fire for alleged ethical lapses that include real estate speculations, attempts to control the press and the dodging of mandatory military service.By law, the candidate for prime minister must earn parliamentary approval.Bashing Lee for \"lying (about the transaction) in front of the people,\" Rep. Jin urged the nominee \"to make a decision\" in an apparent demand that he withdraw.The nominee did not comment on the fresh allegation.On Sunday, a group of opposition lawmakers issued a statement calling on Lee to \"expect no more leniency from the people and to voluntarily withdraw before the plenary session.\"Lee is President Park's third nominee for prime minister since May, after the first two quit over allegations of ethical and other lapses. Lee's failure to win the approval could cause another major setback for the Park administration in running state affairs. Her approval rating has been nearing an all-time low for her administration.In South Korea, the prime minister is the second-highest position after the president, but the job has largely been a ceremonial role as power is concentrated heavily in the president.

She has since been resting at her official residence.\"It depends on how much her health recovers, but there's a possibility she'll resume her public schedule this week,\" the official said on condition of anonymity.If she returns to work Monday, Park is expected to preside over a meeting with her senior secretaries. It also remains to be seen whether she will attend an annual gathering with children at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae to celebrate Children's Day, a public holiday, on Tuesday.One of the most pressing issues for Park is likely to be the nomination of a new prime minister following the resignation of Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo. Lee tendered his resignation last month amid allegations he took bribes from a late businessman at the center of a growing corruption scandal.Speculation is rife over the possible candidates, with more than 10 high-profile figures being named in political circles.Among the reported candidates are Lee Myung-jae, special adviser to the president for civil affairs, acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyoung-hwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Social Affairs Hwang Woo-yea and former maritime affairs minister Lee Ju-young.Park is also expected to express her stance on civil service pension reforms, one of her pet projects, as rival parties agreed last week to pass a reform bill during a plenary session Wednesday.Political reform is also likely to be high on her agenda especially amid the corruption scandal that has implicated some of her close aides.

The initiative was launched with the Korean Federation of Teachers\u2019 Association, Korea\u2019s largest conservative teachers\u2019 group. \u201cI hope this plan will be a turning point for protecting teachers\u2019 rights, allowing them to concentrate on teaching. This will also help establish a foundation of mutual trust and respect among teachers, students and parents,\u201d said Seoul Education Chief Cho Hi-yeon at a press conference held at the SMOE office.The new plan centers on operating the Teachers Rights Protection Support Center, which previously only existed within SMOE, at district-level education offices to make help more accessible for teachers. The center will provide counseling services and support for possible litigation processes.Education authorities will also commission 38 lawyers to provide legal consultation to teachers. The phone consulting service \u2015 introduced in September of last year \u2015 will be free, while fees for face-to-face consulting will be charged to the SMOE.The ideal option, however, would be to prevent legal disputes, noted KFTA chief Ahn Yang-ok. To help work out amicable solutions to teacher-parent discord, SMOE is planning to create a consulting team of retired education workers with leadership or counseling experience, such as former principals and school counselors.\u201cLegal support will be provided to teachers in the case of lawsuits, but the most important thing is to reach an agreement before going to court. For this, the consulting team (of retired teachers) will help with their experience and wisdom before engaging in a legal battle,\u201d Ahn said.But some argued that the 220 million won budget \u2015 which is a tiny fraction of the 7.6 trillion won allocated to the SMOE in 2015 \u2015 would not be enough to provide support to all the city\u2019s teachers. There are more than 70,000 teachers in Seoul, meaning the funding provides a meager 3,000 won per teacher.Further, the budget for legal consultation service is only 2.75 million won, and the SMOE does not yet have a backup plan when the funding runs out.\u201cWe acknowledge that the money we\u2019ve set aside is not sufficient to address the issue of teachers\u2019 rights protection. The budget (for teacher protection) will have to gradually increase,\u201d said an SMOE official. A recent report by Sungkyunkwan University professor Yang Jung-ho showed that 20 percent of Korean teachers regretted their choice of job, the highest figure among all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to the KFTA, on average 1,500 cases of teacher rights violations occurred annually from 2011 to 2013, and 643 cases were reported in first semester of 2014.The KFTA report showed that teachers were being subject to physical, verbal violence and even sexual harassment.

I am encouraging Korea and the Ontario Candu energy sector to work together in terms of new reactors and services, as well as various other nuclear technologies in the world,\" Moridi said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency. Moridi was in Seoul to attend the Korea Atomic Power Annual Conference and to meet with Korean government and company officials to discuss ways to forge closer ties with the energy sector in his jurisdiction.\u00a0 South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and plans to build 11 more by 2024. Among them, four are Candu 6 units imported from Canada, which are pressurized heavy water reactors used for generating electric power. The four are located in Wolsong, a major nuclear hub located on the southeastern coast.South Korea is the largest operator of Candu plants outside its home and \"among the top performers in the world,\" he said. Moridi expressed hope that the bilateral free trade deal, which took effect in January, will boost economic ties in the nuclear and renewable energy sector, noting nuclear reactor technology and uranium were among the top 10 goods Ontario exported to South Korea last year.The recently revised 1974 nuclear energy cooperation pact with the United States that now allows South Korea to reprocess spent fuel and enrich uranium will provide more opportunities for Canada's nuclear industry to work with Korean partners to develop spent fuel technology, the reutilization process and future nuclear energy systems. \u00a0\"Korea would be an ideal market in which to use recycled uranium in its Candu fleet, thereby opening new opportunities for cooperation,\" he said. \"We look forward to the opportunity to discuss mutual priorities and share best practices for our nuclear sectors.\"Although there are lingering safety concerns in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011, the Canadian official said nuclear energy is still a safer and more environment-friendly option compared with traditional power plants, noting it is important to raise public awareness of the benefits of nuclear energy.\"Nuclear reactors and power stations are heavily regulated in such countries as Korea, the United States and Canada.

The KCNA said he has admitted to his \"grave crime\" during interrogation by the North's relevant authorities but it provided no other details, including his motive.In April, the North deported a U.S. woman accused of anti-Pyongyang propaganda activities.Last year, North Korea released three American citizens -- Jeffrey Edward Fowle, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller -- who had been detained there for unspecified anti-state crimes.But a South Korean missionary, Kim Jung-wook, remains detained in North Korea after being sentenced to hard labor for life on charges of spying and setting up underground churches.Meanwhile, the KCNA denounced the United States and the United Nations for organizing a forum on Pyongyang's human rights violations in New York earlier this week.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, ringleaders of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" drug smuggling gang, were arrested in 2005 and sentenced to death the following year after being caught trying to traffick heroin out of Indonesia.They lost a legal bid last week to have their cases reviewed, effectively dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad. Jakarta has said they will be executed this month.Indonesia last month executed six drug offenders, including five foreigners. On Monday the families of Chan and Sukumaran, who in recent days have been on the resort island of Bali where the men are held, visited Jakarta to appeal for authorities to spare the lives of the men, who are in their early 30s. \"We beg you for mercy for our sons, we beg you to spare our sons' lives, we beg you that they not be killed,\" said Sukumaran's mother Raji Sukumaran, sobbing as she read from a statement signed by her and Chan's mother, Helen Chan.At an emotionally charged press conference, the women called on President Joko Widodo, the vice president, the attorney general and \"the Indonesian people to show mercy on our children\".\"I understand the serious crime my son committed. They are both very sorry for this. We are very sorry for this. They are not the same people who committed that crime almost 10 years ago,\" Raji Sukumaran added. She said the pair had been rehabilitated and were now the \"driving force\" behind improving the notorious Kerobokan jail on Bali, through starting programmes that ranged from painting and photography to dance and sewing. Chan's brother Michael, who attended the event, added: \"If we can show the president that these guys have done such an amazing job with what they've had to deal with, I just want them to have that second chance to show that to other people.\"Earlier, their lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis said he planned one last attempt to save their lives by challenging in an administrative court Widodo's decision not to pardon them.Both men lost their appeals for presidential clemency in recent months. The legal move has been rarely attempted before, but Mulya said he did not believe Widodo could simply reject the men's pleas on the basis of a drug emergency.Widodo has been a vocal supporter of capital punishment and warned Indonesia was in a state of emergency due to drugs, with dozens of people dying every day.\"I don't think the president can use that blanket argument to refuse all the clemency applications,\" he said, adding: \"It is unfair, it is unjust, it is unacceptable.\"The lawyer added the challenge was \"probably the only legal recourse left for us\" and he hoped the attorney general would exclude the pair from any executions this month while the legal process was ongoing.","813":"The new leader of the main opposition party on Monday dismissed President Park Geun-hye\u2019s tax policies as a \u201clie,\u201d and vowed to raise South Korea\u2019s welfare spending to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average.Rep. Moon Jae-in, elected to head the New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Sunday, slammed Park\u2019s so-called \u201cwelfare without taxation\u201d policies, which sparked a public uproar after her administration raised the tobacco tax and decreased tax returns in this year\u2019s settlements, while corporate taxes for conglomerates stayed the same, according to critics.Moon also visited the graves of past authoritarian presidents Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee, breaking an unofficial moratorium by left-wing figures.

But he is also known as an authoritarian who violently repressed political opponents and allegedly committed war crimes.Park is often credited with boosting South Korea\u2019s economic output in the 1960s and \u201970s, but is also remembered for using a security apparatus to silence dissidents such as the late former President Kim Dae-jung, a figure revered as one of the godfathers of the South Korean left.\u201cEvery past administration has its deeds and misdeeds,\u201d Moon had said after winning the NPAD convention on Sunday. \u201cPresident Park (Chung-hee) is remembered for the economic growth he fostered.

In an op-ed published by the state-run Global Times newspaper, Li Kaisheng, research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, also publicly admitted that China opposes deploying the U.S. missile-defense system in South Korea because it could hurt China's own security interests. The U.S. has said it was considering deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery in South Korea, home to about 28,500 American troops, to better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities.The THAAD battery is \"nominally intended to counter North Korea, but insiders know, because its scope is about 2,000 kilometers, it far exceeds the defense needs of North Korean ballistic missiles,\" Li said. If South Korea agrees to deploy the THAAD battery, Li said, \"It will undermine the bottom line of the China-South Korea strategic partnership.\" South Korea has officially disavowed its intention to join or host the THAAD battery, but South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo told a parliamentary audit in October that the possible deployment of the U.S. missile-defense system would help ensure the South's security posture.China's concerns over a possible deployment of the THAAD battery in South Korea have illustrated how difficult it is for South Korea and China to develop common security interests in Northeast Asia.South Korea and the U.S. urge China, the economic lifeline of North Korea, to do more in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but China's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that China's Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests.

After closing the bid on Monday, the DAPA had planned to choose a preferred bidder next month before a final selection around June at the earliest.Experts and industry watchers expect fierce competition between KAI and Korean Air Line. KAI has a technical edge over Korean Air based upon its experience developing the T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic trainer and the country's utility helicopter, Surion, while Korean Air has larger investment capacity.Airbus would also be able to complement Korean Air in terms of technical issues, they added.

Given this, it is appropriate to destroy it,\u201d the ruling said.The prosecution had claimed that whether it was a first draft or finished transcript, any such document should be preserved and transferred to the national archives. Last month, prosecutors sought a two-year jail term for both Baek and Cho.The content of the summit transcript was at the center of political controversy during the 2012 presidential election.

The way the surveillance is run ... The physical aspect is just one side of the experience.\"\u00a0In a letter to Kim, the commission of inquiry even warned that he could be held accountable.

Practically all citizens of the entire desperately poor, nuclear-armed country are sealed off from the Internet. Informers are embedded in every level of society. Entire families can be punished for one person's mistakes or crimes.\u00a0Jang says he fled North Korea after he lent a classified foreign document to a friend, who then left it on a train by mistake. He soon made it to South Korea, where he founded a news outlet called New Focus, featuring reports on North Korea based on sources within the country.\u00a0Jang's escape is recounted in \"Dear Leader.\" As with other defectors' accounts, many details can be almost impossible to verify. South Korean reports have said his name is a pen name.\u00a0\"Why would I put my reputation on the line?\" Jang said when the question of changing narratives was raised.\u00a0But he understands the pressures some North Korean defectors face to make their stories more compelling, perhaps especially as international attention to North Korea's human rights situation has grown.\u00a0\"It's true that a lot of people are pressured to want to appease people's expectations,\" Jang said. \"But in Shin's case, it was not for money.

No decision has been made by the U.S. and Washington has yet to call for any official consultation with Seoul on the issue,\u201d he said, declining to be named.The issue of the THAAD deployment has emerged as one of the thorniest issues in South Korea-China relations since the U.S. expressed its desire last year to bring in the missile defense asset here to better counter North Korean threats. China believes the THAAD could potentially target it.Seoul has so far maintained a cautious stance as the deployment of any core U.S. missile defense assets would be perceived as participation in the U.S.-led missile shield program to the detriment of Seoul\u2019s relations with Beijing and Moscow.To avoid fraying ties with the regional powers, Seoul has been working on developing its independent Korea Air and Missile Defense system \u2015 a low-tier, multiple-interception program that destroys incoming missiles at altitudes of 40-50 km.Chang is the first Chinese defense chief to visit Seoul since 2006.

A death penalty is inevitable for the cruelty of gunning down innocent comrades,\u201d the General Military Court of the First Army Headquarters in Wonju, Gangwon Province, said. \u201cHe also discarded his duties as a soldier to protect the safety and property of people. (The court) must hold him accountable for causing a severe security vacuum, and sound an alarm against such a horrid crime.\u201dThe court also pointed out that rather than apologize to the victims, he complained about his own sufferings and blamed fellow soldiers for the deaths.\u00a0 Investigators had said Lim must receive capital punishment for \u201ccommitting a ruthless and premeditated crime against unarmed men.\u201d They added he had shown no signs of remorse and attempted to justify his crimes by saying he had been bullied by his colleagues in the barracks.A month before the incident, Lim had reportedly been involved in a quarrel with another soldier.His legal representative complained that the court had ignored several testimonies proving that Lim had been bullied, and said he would launch an appeal.A family representative of the victims said it was an \u201cobvious ruling\u201d and urged authorities to make sure such an incident would not reoccur. A psychiatric evaluation of Lim released in January indicated signs of paranoia typically found in bullying victims, but concluded that these were within a normal range.At 8:15 p.m. on June 21, Lim detonated a grenade and opened fire in and outside his unit\u2019s barracks, killing or injuring a dozen soldiers. He then fled the scene with a K-2 rifle, 60 bullets and a grenade.He was captured the next day north of the Civilian Access Control Line near the border after a gunfight with troops attempting to apprehend him.Lim joined the Army in December 2012 for his mandatary military service and was to be discharged in September 2014.The case is the worst military killing spree since 2005, when a soldier killed eight people and left two seriously injured.

But he hailed the alliance that rose from the ashes of that terrible conflict 70 years ago as one that will ``enhance the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region.''He also sought support for a 12-nation trans-Pacific trade pact that has divided Congress, telling lawmakers it should be completed ``for the sake of our children and our children's children.''","855":"A total of 51 earthquakes struck the Korean Peninsula last year, with the strongest temblor measuring 5.1 in magnitude, the government said Sunday.Last year's tally is slightly under the annual average of 52.9 quakes for the 10 years since 2005, according to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security.The 5.1-magnitude earthquake, which was reported in waters about 100 kilometers northwest of the West Gyeongnyeolbi Archipelago off Taean on the central west coast on April 1, marked the fourth-strongest quake to hit the Korean Peninsula since seismic monitoring began in 1978.Meanwhile, fewer accidents occurred at sea than the annual average for the five previous years, but more people were killed, largely as a result of the ferry Sewol's sinking in April, which claimed more than 300 lives, the ministry said.

They also came after Pyongyang offered to temporarily suspend nuclear tests in exchange for a halt to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, though Washington rejected the proposal as an \"implicit threat.\"\"It appears nothing new came up\" during the meetings, a senior South Korean official said on condition of anonymity because South Korea was not involved in the talks. \"It appears the discussions went about what we can always guess.\"Even before the meetings, the U.S. had downplayed the contact, saying it would only be \"one of many\" nongovernmental \"Track 2\" meetings held to discuss security issues in East Asia, and that the U.S. government is not involved in it.\"Track 2\" diplomacy refers to nongovernmental, unofficial contacts between private citizens or groups of individuals while \"Track 1\" diplomacy refers to officials government-to-government contacts.Relations between the U.S. and the North have worsened further recently following a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures.

(Yonhap)","859":"Controversy escalated on Thursday over the government\u2019s inconsistent introduction of a new system to levy more health insurance fees on high earners.Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo told lawmakers Wednesday that he would not push ahead with the plan aimed at changing the way the government collects fees from health insurance subscribers this year. The remark quickly raised speculation that the minister may have been under pressure from the presidential office to backpedal on the policy to avoid agitating taxpayers already upset with the recent tax increases.Cheong Wa Dae, however, exacerbated the mess Thursday as it flatly denied the minister\u2019s remark, saying that the government would consider introducing the new system. The ministry backtracked from the new health insurance policy entirely on Moon\u2019s judgment, said presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook. \u201cWe believe that (the remark came from) the health minister\u2019s own judgment that the government may need deeper discussion on the policy in order to form a social consensus,\u201d he said.The Park government has been seeking ways to implement a new system to fairly impose health insurance fees based on subscribers\u2019 income levels.The new policy on health insurance was to plug an obvious loophole in the system. Under the current payment system, some subscribers with similar incomes pay different health insurance fees and those who are registered as a dependent in a family are not obliged to pay the mandatory fees even if they hold massive amounts of assets.The unfairness of the system sparked criticism when a mother and her two daughters committed suicide last year after suffering from financial difficulties. Because none of the family members were employed, they had to pay a monthly health insurance cost of 50,140 won, which was calculated based on their assets, even though other rich subscribers enjoy the same health service for free if they are registered as dependents.The revision of the system was one of Park\u2019s campaign pledges.Minister Moon\u2019s remark follows the harsh public criticism the Park administration faced over the government\u2019s new tax settlement scheme. In the face of strong resistance, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to push for revision of the tax code to offer more tax refunds to eligible taxpayers.The main opposition New Politics Alliance Democracy lashed out at the government for backtracking on its plan to revise the current health insurance payment system. \u201cIt is the president\u2019s duty to seek the public\u2019s understanding after honestly explaining the reason why the government has given up on the policy,\u201d said Rep. Woo Yoon-keun.\u201cThis is not the first time that Park didn\u2019t keep her promises, but it is apparent that the people would be more disappointed on this,\u201d he said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","860":"Main opposition party officials on Thursday reiterated suspicion that Prime Minister nominee Rep. Lee Wan-koo had speculated on real estate, as part of efforts to scrutinize the nation\u2019s next potential Cabinet member.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy has made a laundry list of accusations against Lee and his family. Lee has vowed to clear his name at his confirmation hearing next Monday, three days before the National Assembly puts his appointment to a final vote.His critics fall into two camps. A moderate group says Lee\u2019s confirmation hearing should focus on examining the nominee\u2019s competence as the president\u2019s top deputy. Hard-liners say that his past raises questions that must be answered. Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo answers questions from reporters in front of his temporary office in Tongui-dong, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)NPAD hard-liners appear to be focusing their firepower on allegations that Lee speculated on land in Gyeonggi Province in 2000, when he was serving on the parliamentary panel that oversees national real estate policy. The value of the land he bought is thought to have risen tenfold.His critics have also cited property records showing that the governing Saenuri Party\u2019s former floor leader bought a luxury apartment in the relatively wealthy Gangnam district of Seoul in 2003, before selling it six months later for approximately 39 percent higher than the initial price.Lee denied the charges, reiterating that he has documents to prove related tax payments and claimed that he sold the properties for reasons unrelated to speculation.NPAD hard-liners have also launched attacks pertaining to Lee\u2019s family, although main opposition officials appear to be retreating on those issues, after moderates hinted that the charges had gone too far.Those attacks include an accusation that Lee\u2019s second son dodged mandatory military service in 2006 by faking a leg injury, with Lee\u2019s implicit approval.In tears, Lee vowed Thursday that his son would take an MRI image of the leg. \u201cI feel mixed emotions, because I could be asking him to do something beyond anything a father should ask his son to do,\u201d he said.Seoul National University Hospital officials later told reporters that X-ray photos of the leg \u201clikely showed an earlier surgery in the ligament following an injury.\u201dAnother charge against his family involves his brother, who was arrested in 2011 for influence peddling and receiving bribes from public contractors in South Chungcheong Province. Lee was governor there until 2009.NPAD officials have also questioned Lee\u2019s stint with law enforcement during ex-President Chun Doo-hwan\u2019s rule in the early 1980s\u2019, when Chun, a military dictator, used his influence over the military and police to impose an authoritarian regime.The list goes on. But Lee appears confident that he will survive the political onrush, saying he will reveal everything at his confirmation hearing.President Park Geun-hye last Friday named Lee to join her Cabinet as her No. 2.

Ambassador Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, made the remarks upon his arrival at the Beijing airport for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei, after visiting Tokyo. North Korea has confirmed the attendance of its leader for a May ceremony in Russia marking the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday, without mentioning Kim Jong-un's name.If realized, it would be Kim's first foreign trip since taking the helm of North Korea in late 2011. Some analysts are concerned that closer ties between North Korea and Russia may complicate diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea. Asked about Kim Jong-un's possible visit to Russia in May, Sung Kim replied, \"I have seen reports that the visit might be possible.\" \"The main thing is that Russians remain very much committed to denuclearization and the joint statement of the six-party process,\" he said. \"They have made it very clear that they would strongly oppose nuclear tests by North Korea and, in fact, they oppose continuing nuclear activities by North Korea.\" The U.S. envoy further said he held \"very productive\" talks in Tokyo with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts and expects to hold \"very substantive and detailed\" talks with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing. North Korea is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia at a time when its political relationship with China remains frosty amid international pressure over its nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the conflict in Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia. Putin invited Kim Jong-un to attend the May 9 ceremony during a meeting with Kim's special envoy in November. China is North Korea's main economic benefactor, but political ties between the allies remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.

The figure is a huge increase from six in 2013.Including those formally recognized as refugees and granted rights to legally stay in the country on humanitarian grounds, the number of asylum seekers practically accepted in the country in 2014 comes to 633.The number of asylum seekers in South Korea has been increasing drastically since the country legislated a law on refugees in 2013.The figure stood at only 423 in 2010 but jumped to 1,011 in 2011 and has since been on a steady increase from 1,143 in 2012, to 1,574 in 2013 and 2,896 in 2014.In South Korea, foreigners with refugee status are eligible for social welfare benefits on a level equal to Korean nationals.The government additionally provides financial support to those who have requested refugee status but are awaiting final approval to help cover their living costs for up to six months.

However, it was extremely unusual that, at least on paper, China sold no crude oil to North Korea for all of last year.In 2014, China's exports of petroleum products to North Korea jumped 48.22 percent from a year earlier to US$1.54 million, according to the data based on Chinese trade statistics and compiled by the Beijing unit of South's Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency.\"Although final statistics show that China's exports of crude oil to North Korea were counted as 'zero' in 2014, experts suggest that the possibility of China's suspension of crude oil exports to North Korea remains low,\" the agency said in a statement.South Korean diplomatic sources in Beijing have also cautioned against reading too much into the official Chinese trade figures because China has provided crude oil to North Korea in the form of grant aid and such shipments were not recorded on paper.There has been no clear indication that the 2014 trade figures reflect China's willingness to use crude oil as leverage to press North Korea to change course in its nuclear ambition.North Korea conducted its third and most powerful nuclear test in February 2013, straining political ties with Beijing's leadership.Asked about the absence of crude oil shipments to North Korea, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying stressed Beijing's \"normal\" trade relations with North Korea, but sidestepped questions over whether Beijing genuinely stopped shipping crude oil to Pyongyang.Excluding crude oil, bilateral trade between North Korea and China fell 2.79 percent from a year ago to $6.36 billion last year, marking the first annual decline in six years, according to the data.

Shin Sang-jin won in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, taking 55.9 percent of the votes. Ahn Sang-soo won in Incheon with 54.11 percent.In the most closely contested district of Gwanak, Seoul, Oh Shin-hwan triumphed with 43.89 percent of the votes, as liberal votes were split by the NPAD\u2019s Jung Tae-ho and Chung Dong-young, a former opposition presidential candidate running as an independent.

The polls were held to fill four seats vacated by members of a defunct leftist party and a Saenuri official found guilty last month of violating election laws in 2012.Analysts said the Saenuri Party\u2019s win has secured it a stronger position to lead future talks in the Assembly on reforms pursued by the Park Geun-hye administration.Voters line up to cast their ballots in Seoul on Wednesday.

Kim even said he is open to a summit with the South's president.Speaking at a forum in Seoul, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said Kim's pledge would end up in empty talk if Pyongyang continues to boycott dialogue with the South.\u00a0 In late December, the South's presidential panel on reunification offered minister-level talks with the North, but Pyongyang has not responded to the proposal.

According to the report by the Hyundai Research Institute (HRI), the peace index for Seoul-Pyongyang relations for the September-November period came to 44.1, the highest ever since the think tank first began conducting such studies in late 2009.The numbers have been on a downtrend since late 2013. In the past year, they dropped to below 40, a level that signifies cross-border tensions.The index ranges from 0 to 100, and higher numbers indicate better inter-Korean relations. An index ranging between 40 and 60 shows that the two neighbors face a mix of both cooperation and opposition, while an index ranging between 20 and 40 signifies heightened tensions.A survey of 103 local experts also showed that the peace index for the December-February period is expected to increase further to 51.8, the report added. Improvement in the figure was largely attributed to the growth of inter-Korean trade as well as heightened expectations for high-level talks.\u00a0 In the three-month period between June and August last year, trade between the two countries came to US$682.88 million, up 16.2 percent on-quarter from the previous $587.9 million, according to the HRI report.Furthermore, in early October, a high-powered North Korea delegation made a surprise visit to South Korea to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, and had agreed with South Korea's top security officials to hold another round of high-level talks. The report, however, also took a cautious stance toward the improved ratings, as local experts still view the two Koreas as somewhat in a state of tension. \"It is necessary to go ahead with temporary plans, at the least, to help recover mutual trust and deliver our sense of sincerity in the matter,\" the report said, adding that halting the launches of anti-North Korean leaflets across the border may be one example.The Korean Peninsula was divided in the aftermath of World War II, and the two Koreas have been technically in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.

FINA is headquartered there, but according to the KSF, FINA said it will confirm the specific location of the hearing later.FINA has separately told Park's camp about the hearing, according to the KSF.Park's career appears to be in jeopardy after the news of his failed doping test emerged earlier this week. The KSF has said Park was tested ahead of the Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon, which opened in September, and was notified of the result last October.Park, a four-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champ, has blamed the positive test on an injection he took at a local hospital. His agency, Team GMP, is seeking a legal action against the Seoul-based hospital, and state prosecutors said Tuesday Park received a shot of testosterone, a substance banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Prosecutors are considering indicting the doctor who administered the injection, surnamed Kim, on charges of professional negligence.According to prosecutors, officials from the hospital have claimed that they gave Park the injection to help boost his hormone levels but that they weren't aware that testosterone was a banned substance.Park's camp has told the authorities that the swimmer repeatedly asked the hospital about the contents of the injection and that he was assured that the shot would be clean.Though Park is arguing that he didn't intentionally take the banned substance, he may ultimately be held accountable for the result and face discipline, based on WADA's World Anti-Doping Code.In Article 10, titled \"Sanctions on Individuals,\" the code states that if an athlete can establish that he or she bears no fault or negligence, the athlete may not face sanctions. However, one exception cited by the same code is \"the administration of a prohibited substance by the athlete's personal physician or trainer without disclosure to the athlete.\"The code also points out: \"Athletes are responsible for their choice of medical personnel and for advising medical personnel that they cannot be given any prohibited substance.\" (Yonhap)","869":"The government plans to introduce a state-run qualification examination for day care workers amid rising concerns over the state\u2019s lax monitoring of the child care system.

Those without cameras will be barred from operations.The surveillance camera requirement had been pushed at the National Assembly in 2010 but failed to pass the welfare committee after some lawmakers expressed concerns over privacy of day care employees.The government will also double the reward for child abuse whistle-blowers to 20 million won ($18,500) to increase detection, officials said. The ministry will also raise the number of assistant teachers at facilities to reduce the workload of day care workers while improving care quality. \u201cAbout 6,500 assistants will be provided nationwide and all costs will be borne by the state. While it is under discussion, around 200 to 300 billion won is expected to be earmarked for the move,\u201d a ministry official told media. Along with more workers, the ministry will open 450 additional public day care centers by 2017 in order to handle the high need from parents, officials said. All these new regulations will be submitted to the parliament next month, officials added. Meanwhile, the police authorities vowed to strengthen penalties against those who interfered in child abuse investigations. Dispatched investigators have complained over difficulties in conducting inquiries into child abuse cases. There have been no legal punishments against people who refuse to help investigations. A one-year jail term or a fine of up to 5 million won will be levied for obstructing a police investigation into child abuse allegations, authorities said.

Students attending middle and high schools and universities said their stress mainly comes from college entrance and unemployment problems.In the same survey, 40.6 percent of the respondents were found to feel the urge to run away from home with 9.8 percent answering they have an experience of leaving home without notice. About 31.8 percent and 53.1 percent of the youth said they have dialogue with their father and mother for at least an hour a week, up 7.9 percent each from 2011.Slightly more than 86 percent of the respondents answered they are happy, an increase from 81.4 percent in 2011.\"The longer they talk with their parents, the less stress and urge to leave home and the more happiness youths were found to feel,\" the ministry said in a release about the survey.

In contrast, there was a sharp influx of people into Sejong, the new administrative city, Jeju Island and South Chungcheong Province.Seoul lost 88,000 people last year, while Sejong gained 33,000, with Jeju adding 11,000.The agency said most people left Seoul because of housing issues, while people who moved to Sejong and Jeju did so for employment reasons.

It did not specify the timing and venue.Kim was quoted as stressing the importance of honing capabilities to mount a \"deadly attack,\" saying a \"powerful offensive means rock-firm defense.\"A set of photos released by the KCNA showed Kim watching the training and a couple of top military officials -- Hwang Pyong-so and Hyon Yong-chol -- directly leading it aboard a mobile artillery launcher and an armored vehicle. Both Hwang, director of the military's general political bureau, and Hyon, minister of defense, are 66 years old. Carrying a similar report, the (North) Korean Central Broadcasting Station described the U.S. as a deadly foe and claimed it blatantly revealed an ambition to topple the socialist system.Last week, Obama said in an interview on YouTube that the isolated communist regime is likely to collapse mainly due to the Internet-driven inflow of information.The North's broadcaster also condemned the latest spread of anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons in the country by a group of conservative activists in the South.On Sunday, the National Defense Commission, Pyongyang's top ruling organ, warned of stern punishment against South Korea, accusing it of allowing the leaflet campaign and planning to start annual joint military drills with the U.S. in March.

Park\u2019s approval ratings recently hit a new low of 34.1 percent.Under the new system, the authorities levy less taxes throughout the year and return less in tax settlements at the beginning of a new year. The key issue is that workers who did not spend much through the year face greater tax burdens in February.Though the Finance Ministry had asserted that the new scheme was aimed at improvement in wealth distribution, there are concerns that more middle and low-income workers could eventually be subject to higher taxation.The meeting drew attention as four extraordinary aides, who was appointed early Monday, joined discussions with the senior presidential secretaries. The post of extraordinary aide have been created to bolster communications with the public.Public support for Park waned further last week, after preliminary calculations of this year\u2019s tax settlements showed that taxpayers nationwide could end up paying more taxes, or receive much smaller rebates than expected. Revisions to tax codes in 2013 by the government were blamed for the increased taxes.Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party on Monday denounced Cheong Wa Dae for Friday\u2019s personnel reshuffle.\u201cThe public had continued to call on the presidential office to drastically revamp the aides\u2019 organization after (the behind-the-scenes) power struggle scandal. But (the president) still showed credibility toward Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and three core secretaries,\u201d said Moon Hee-sang, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Moon said the administration had glossed over public opinion as it conducted the overhaul without dismissal of the chief of staff and some others, who were seen as accountable for the scandal.In contrast, the opposition leader highly assessed Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo. \u201cHe pushed forth wide communications with opposition lawmakers as a floor leader of the (ruling) Saenuri Party.\u201dMoon, however, vowed to thoroughly review his personal records in the coming confirmation hearings of the National Assembly.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","874":"President Park Geun-hye\u2019s disapproval rating hit a new high last week, amid fears that her waning public support could stymie her economic reform plans, a poll showed Monday.Park\u2019s support rating stood at 34.5 percent, a weekly poll conducted by opinion surveyor Realmeter of 2,500 adults nationwide from Jan. 19 to 23 showed. Her disapproval rating hit 58.3 percent, a rise of 6.4 percent. The 95 percent confidence level was plus or minus 2 percent.Support ratings for President Park\u2019s governing Saenuri Party stood at 38.6 percent.The announcement follows a Gallup Korea report last week that showed the president\u2019s approval rating at a record low of 30 percent.Realmeter\u2019s survey results also showed that 40.3 percent of respondents \u201chighly disapproved\u201d of the president, marking the first time the figure has exceeded 40 percent.President Park is facing an apparent political crisis according to survey results from the two pollsters this month. Analysts said Park\u2019s refusal to fire her top aides accused of meddling in state affairs in the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, and the public uproar over increased taxes were the likely causes.Park last Friday named Saenuri Rep. Lee Wan-koo, a reputed compromiser who has supporters even in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, as her new Prime Minister to apparently raise her public ratings. Park is likely to reshuffle her aides in coming weeks.\u201cPark\u2019s ratings are lower than her party\u2019s. This means she\u2019s not helping her party. It means she\u2019s actually contributing to the party\u2019s unpopularity among voters,\u201d Myongji University professor Chung Jin-min said in a phone interview last week.If Park\u2019s approval ratings continue to fall, her top initiatives such as reforms to the pension for retired civil servants could be stalled in the National Assembly, as lawmakers looking to run in the 2016 parliamentary election try to distance themselves from the unpopular president\u2019s policies.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","875":"A Korean woman who was forced into sexual servitude by Japan\u2019s World War II soldiers died Monday, an advocacy group for these former sex slaves said Monday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Moscow received a positive signal from Pyongyang over the invitation for Kim. On Saturday, U.S. funded-broadcaster Voice of America reported, citing an email response from the Kremlin, that Kim is likely to accept the invitation. \"There is a possibility that Kim Jong-un could visit Russia in May, given the current frosty relations between North Korea and China,\" said the diplomatic source in Beijing. \"To my knowledge, North Korea has not given a final decision on whether to accept the Russian invitation,\" the source said on the condition of anonymity. The South Korean government is \"closely watching\" the development between North Korea and Russia, according to the source. North Korea is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia at a time when its political relationship with China remains frosty amid international pressure over its nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the conflict in Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia. Putin invited Kim to attend the May 9 ceremony during a meeting with Kim's special envoy in November. China is North Korea's main economic benefactor, but political ties between the allies remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013. In what many analysts believe was a message to North Korea, Xi paid a state visit to South Korea last year, breaking a long-standing tradition by Chinese heads of state of visiting Pyongyang before Seoul.Last week, China sounded positive about Kim's possible visit to Russia in May, with the Chinese foreign ministry saying, \"Such exchanges between North Korea and Russia will contribute to the peace and stability of the region.\" (Yonhap)","877":"A Korean woman who was forced into sexual servitude by Japan's World War II soldiers died Monday, an advocacy group for these former sex slaves said Monday.

Park expected that the number would continuously increase over the next several years.Park, in particular, cited the rapidly growing number of tourists from China and Southeast Asian countries. Accordingly to her forecast, tourists would account for about 65 percent, or 15 million, of the expected 23 million visitors in 2020.The proportion of Asian tourists to South Korea increased by 6 percentage points over the past decade, from 50.5 percent in 2005 to 56.5 percent in 2014.Out the of the estimated 23 million visitors in 2020, the number of tourists from developed countries and other emerging nations is projected to reach 7 million and 1 million, respectively, Park added.The institute reiterated that it was necessary for the government to diversify tour products and raise the quality of products in order to increase the rate of return visits.According to a study by a public company, inbound foreign tourists on average spent a record $901 on shopping when visiting Korea last year.The Korea Culture and Tourism Institute has said that the findings are based on surveys of 9,062 visitors in the January-September period.The state-run institute added that cosmetics, clothing and food were the top three items purchased by tourists. Meanwhile, expenditure on accommodation and food dropped because visitors spent an average of 6.1 days in the country in 2014, down from 6.9 days in 2013.In terms of reasons for visiting, business trips fell to 19.6 percent from 23.3 percent, while leisure jumped to 57.9 percent from 47.7 percent.\u201cThe weak Japanese yen did not discourage foreigners from coming in droves last year,\u201d said the institute.Around half of inbound tourists were from China, followed by visitors from Japan and the United States.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","886":"While South Korea is hopeful of an inter-Korean family reunion this year, Japan is jittery over the return of its citizens kidnapped by North Korea during the Cold War.For Japan, the abductions have been a more pressing issue than nuclear and missile threats.

The scope of assistance was truly beyond our imagination.\u201cAs a de facto developed country, Denmark has the capacity to invest heavily and wisely in long-term partnerships.\u201dThrough bilateral cooperation, secured through a memorandum of understanding last March, students received high-quality materials, a sewing machine and expertise in working with furs, while Kopenhagen Fur has gained innovative designs.Aside from collaborating year-round, a weeklong Korea-Denmark exchange took place last year featuring workshops and training. The exchange helped expand mutual cultural understanding, according to the professor. \u201cAt first, there were students who were thin-skinned about making fur coats due to the killing of animals,\u201d Ha said. \u201cBut our main philosophy has been to break the stereotypes that fur coats are unethical, expensive and wasteful. We have worn furs for millions of years. We can also wear them as casual, affordable and friendly clothes.\u201dModels pose at the \u201cFuture Fur\u201d fashion show at Seoul National University\u2019s Museum of Art last Tuesday. (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)Kopenhagen Fur\u2019s vice-president of marketing Ditte Hejberg Sorknaes said, \u201cOur collaboration has truly been a win-win situation for both sides. We really need the innovation, creativity and courage of young talented designers.\u201dSorknaes said that many students who participated in the program had been hired by leading European fashion firms after graduation, including Diesel, Dior and Louis Vuitton. \u201cAfter spending several years in the professional field, they go back to Asia with their hands-on expertise and know-how, bridging both markets,\u201d she said.Kopenhagen Fur has partnerships with 12 universities around the world, and is working to add three more universities by the end of the year. Three selected winners from Seoul National University will travel to Denmark in late January this year to participate in the Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in the Nordic region.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","888":"North Korea's National Defense Commission said Sunday South Korea will face \"stern punishment\" unless it halts joint military drills with the United States and blocks the spread of anti-Pyongyang leaflets by activists here.In a statement, the commission, directly run by leader Kim Jong-un, blamed South Korea for a failure to resume inter-Korean dialogue. (Yonhap)","889":"The now-defunct minor opposition party said Sunday it is seeking to overturn a high-profile constitutional court ruling last month that ordered its disbandment.In the first ruling of its kind, the Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of the Unified Progressive Party on Dec. 19, saying it posed threats to South Korean democracy.A former UPP lawmaker, meanwhile, had been standing a separate criminal trial over allegations that he planned to overthrow the South Korean government in case of an inter-Korean war.In a ruling that apparently contradicts the Constitutional Court's, however, the Supreme Court last week partially sided with Lee Seok-ki, delivering a not-guilty verdict on charges that he plotted a rebellion. Instead, he was found guilty of encouraging other members to do so.The Supreme Court also said there was no proof that a secret organization in which the 53-year-old and other UPP members convened to discuss insurgency plans existed.Oh Byeong-yun, a former UPP floor leader, noted the discrepancy and said he was consulting a team of attorneys to determine when and how to ask for a retrial.The South Korean Constitutional Court currently does not allow appellate trials.While some experts said the court might make an exception in this case, others have been pessimistic.\"It was imprudent of the Constitutional Court to deliver a ruling before the Supreme Court's decision,\" said Lim Ji-bong, a law professor at Sogang University. \"But it's very unlikely that the court would accept a request for retrial.\" (Yonhap)","890":"Three North Koreans believed to be army deserters killed three Chinese citizens in the border city of Helong last week, a Chinese media reported Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0The Beijing News, citing a statement issued by a verified Weibo account of the propaganda department of Helong, said a manhunt has been under way. \u00a0\u00a0The incident took place on Friday just across the Tumen River dividing China and North Korea, according to the report. South Korean public broadcaster KBS reported the incident on Tuesday night. \u00a0\u00a0The Beijing News report identified the victims as a 55-year-old surnamed Chao, his 26-year-old daughter and a 67-year-old Sun. \u00a0\u00a0China's foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. \u00a0\u00a0On Dec. 28, a North Korean army deserter killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery in Helong, prompting Beijing to lodge a rare diplomatic protest with Pyongyang.\u00a0\u00a0China has beefed up its border patrols since then. \u00a0\u00a0It has not been uncommon for North Korean soldiers or citizens to cross the border into Chinese towns and attempt robberies in search of food.

(Yonhap)","892":"Four teachers received suspended jail terms Friday after a Seoul court found them guilty of engaging in pro-North Korea activities.The four, who are part of a progressive teachers' union, were indicted in February 2013 on charges of holding two lectures endorsing North Korean ideals from January 2008 to May 2009. The lectures, prosecutors said, took place in front of prospective teachers and fellow members of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, the country's second-largest teachers' union.The four were also charged with the possession of original North Korean texts and the distribution of excerpts from a memoir by North Korean leader Kim Il-sung in violation of the National Security Law.The law bans any activities meant to praise, promote or propagandize North Korean ideals.The Seoul Central District Court found them guilty of these charges and gave them 18-month sentences with a two-year stay of execution.\"The court finds them guilty of possessing documents that praise North Korea's 'songun' and 'juche' ideologies,\" Judge Cho Yong-hyeon said in a ruling, referring to the North's military-first and self-reliance philosophies. \"It is inappropriate for South Korean citizens, let alone teachers, to have such documents in their possession.\"The four, however, were acquitted of a charge of forming an \"anti-state group,\" though prosecutors had said the group they formed in January 2008 was \"in the interest of the country's enemies.\"\"It is unclear who authored the documents that prosecutors submitted as evidence,\" Judge Cho said. \"Because it hasn't been proven by testimony, the court cannot consider the evidence valid.\"Prosecutors had sought jail sentences of up to six years.In a separate ruling, the Seoul court gave suspended sentences to nine former members of the now-dissolved Unified Progressive Party for creating an \"anti-state group\" in May 2006.The nine were indicted in 2013 on charges of forming the group and attempting to follow the North's plans of communizing South Korea.They were given sentences ranging up to two years in jail, suspended for three years.The minor opposition party was dissolved last month after the Constitutional Court ruled the party \"unconstitutional.\" (Yonhap)","893":"North Korea is going all out to discredit human rights abuse charges following a well-known defector's recent confession of errors in his accounts about life in the communist country.Last week, Shin Dong-hyuk, one of the most frequently cited survivors of brutal North Korean prison camps, admitted to some errors in the timeline and the location of his accounts of experience and defection from North Korea's political prison camp.Shin's confession has challenged the credibility of a United Nations commission of inquiry report on North Korea human rights violations, which heavily drew on the case of Shin's birth and sufferings at a prison camp in the North.Shin admitted that he was raised at a lighter-security prison camp rather than at the most brutal one, where he was previously known to have been born and tortured.This prompted North Korea to launch full-fledged efforts to discredit Shin and international human rights abuse charges.In a statement issued by the association of human rights studies on Jan. 21, North Korea said the recent U.N. COI report is \"sheer lies\" because testimonies by North Korean defectors, including Shin, which the report is based on, cannot be trusted.\"So needless to say, all the 'resolutions on the human rights' forcibly adopted against the DPRK on the basis of such false documents are invalid,\" the statement noted.The statement was later followed by letters to the U.N. and its Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by North Korean Ambassador to the U.N. Ja Song-nam, as well as So Se-pyong, ambassador to the North Korean mission to Geneva, which called for the suspension of human rights violation charges against North Korea.The U.S. and COI Chairman Michael Kirby came to the defense of the human rights report earlier this week, saying that the report is sufficient enough as evidence of North Korea's deplorable human rights situation.Despite the defense, the North may muster further efforts to discredit testimonies of North Korean defectors, as well as human rights violation charges based on the testimonies, experts said.\"So far, the testimonies of North Korean defectors played the key role in formulating the image of North Korea to the outside world,\" said Chang Yong-suk, a researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. \"The country could attempt to capitalize on the recent episode of Shin in order to renew its negative image,\" Chang noted.The COI report, which accused North Korea of \"systemic, widespread and gross human rights violations,\" was the basis of the U.N.'s adoption of a human rights resolution late last year, calling for the referral of the human right situation to the International Criminal Court.North Korea has vehemently resisted the COI report, saying it's a U.S. plot to topple the regime.

(Yonhap)","895":"Investigators sought an arrest warrant for another day care teacher accused of child abuse, police said Thursday, amid a growing public uproar over a series of such cases. The 25-year-old day care worker in Incheon was suspected of having hit a dozen 4-year-old children habitually and verbally abused them for not following the curriculum. This is the second arrest warrant sought for a day care employee in the city this year. A 33-year-old teacher was arrested last week for striking a 4-year-old boy for not finishing a meal. As public outrage escalated over the case, the police have launched an intensive anti-child-abuse campaign.While the day care worker admitted that she had hit the children since October last year, she claimed that her actions were aimed at improving their learning, the Incheon police said. Investigators have uncovered more than 60 cases of child abuse from surveillance camera footage over the past 30 days. The city government said it would suspend or permanently shut down the day care center in question. Meanwhile, the police are conducting a probe into two other child abuse cases at child care facilities reported earlier this month, authorities said.

Upon his arrival at the Beijing airport before flying to Pyongyang, Ri Yong-ho, the North's chief negotiator to the long-stalled six-party talks on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, remained tight-lipped over whether he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei, in Beijing.A South Korean diplomatic source in Beijing downplayed the possibility of bilateral talks between Ri and Wu this week, saying, \"To my knowledge, no talks between the chief nuclear envoys of North Korea and China were held this week.\" Ri arrived in Beijing on Tuesday from Singapore, where he repeated North Korea's calls that Pyongyang would temporarily suspend nuclear tests if the United States halts joint military exercises with South Korea this year. Both Seoul and Washington rejected the proposal.A former U.S. special envoy for North Korea policy, Stephen Bosworth, was among Ri's dialogue partners in Singapore on Sunday and Monday. The others included former deputy U.S. nuclear negotiator Joseph DeTrani and Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council. Although the U.S. government was not involved, former American officials and North Korean diplomats have occasionally held unofficial talks to help the two governments better understand each other's positions.The six-party denuclearization talks have been suspended since late 2008.

(AFP)","899":"Japan should address history issues by promoting the healing of wartime wounds if it wants to build a closer partnership with the United States, a White House official said Wednesday.Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the White House's National Security Council, made the remark during a Brookings Institution seminar, saying the U.S. wants to see a Japan that is \"influential, credible, active and a strong partner.\"\"Only by effectively addressing history issues by promoting healing will, I think, we achieve that kind of Japan. They will find very, very close partners in the United States,\" he said.Medeiros also welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's statement that he would include Japan's remorse over the war and how the country will contribute to the region and beyond in a special statement he plans to issue to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War II in August. \"We thought that Prime Minister Abe's January 5th speech, in which he addressed history issues, was very important and significant,\" he said, adding that the statement \"provided a very useful signal of how he and Japan are going to address history issues in this important year.\"\"We warmly welcome the statements that he made and we hope that that is realized throughout the year,\" he said.Japan's relations with South Korea have been frayed for years due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation. Their relations worsened further after Abe came into office as he took a series of nationalistic steps.South Korea and Japan have not held a formal bilateral summit for more than two years as Tokyo has refused to accept Seoul's demand that it take sincere steps to resolve the issue of Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.The U.S. has called for Seoul and Tokyo to come to terms with each other. Frayed relations between the two key Asian allies are a cause for concern for Washington as it seeks to develop three-way security cooperation in an effort to keep a rising China in check.

It was the first question to Abe during the conference.\u00a0\u00a0Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe giving a speech at Harvard University on April 27, 2015. (Yonhap)Abe also said his cabinet upholds the 1993 Kono Statement, in which Japan apologized for the atrocity, and has no intention of revising the statement.\u00a0\u00a0He went on to say that \"women's dignity and basic human rights have often been infringed upon during wars\" throughout the 20th century, a remark that could be seen as meaning that Japan is not the only violator of women's rights.\u00a0\u00a0The words, \"deeply pained,\" are one of the expressions that Abe has used in order not to mention \"apology\" when it comes to the sexual slavery issue. Another expression is that his \"heart aches\" when thinking of the sexual slavery victims.\u00a0\u00a0Abe used that expression Monday during a discussion with Harvard University students.\u00a0\u00a0\"When it comes to the comfort women issue, my heart aches when I think about those people who were victimized by human trafficking and who were subject to immeasurable pain and suffering beyond description,\" Abe said Monday.\u00a0\u00a0The selection of the term \"human trafficking,\" instead of sexual slavery, was also seen as an attempt to evade Japan's responsibility because the term is usually associated in South Korea and some other Asian nations with private prostitution.\u00a0\u00a0Abe's word play dashed hope for him to issue a clear apology when he addresses Congress on Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.\u00a0\u00a0Such efforts have intensified after Abe came to power.\u00a0\u00a0Abe's cabinet, for example, angered South Korea last year with its attempt to \"review\" the Kono Statement of apology. Though Japan later said it still stands by the apology, the move was seen as an attempt to undermine the apology's credibility. \u00a0\u00a0His government also came under strong criticism last year after pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday's address would make Abe the first prime minister to address a joint meeting of Congress.\u00a0\u00a0Critics have said Abe is unworthy of the honor because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual slavery, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.\u00a0\u00a0In front of Congress, about 200 people from South Korea, the U.S. and China held a rally urging Abe to apologize. Those attending the rally included a surviving sexual slavery victim, Lee Yong-soo, and a South Korean lawmaker, Kim Jong-hoon.\u00a0\u00a0\"Abe keeps lying that they never took (comfort women) by force, but I'm a living witness who was taken to Japan's kamikaze unit in Taiwan at age 15,\" Lee told the rally. \"If he has a little bit of conscience left, Abe should formally apologize and make legal compensation.\"\u00a0\u00a0Brian Becker, executive director of ANSWER Coalition, a major anti-war and civil rights group, urged Abe to stop playing \"word games.\"\u00a0\u00a0\"We can't forget the past because if we do, it will repeat,\" he said. \"So Prime Minister Abe needs to take full responsibility, not play word games, but actually take full accountability and responsibility for those crimes, to apologize, to compensate victims and to be able to say this will never ever happen again.\"\u00a0\u00a0Also Tuesday, Korean-American organizations ran a full-page ad in the Washington Post in the form of an \"open letter\" to the peoples of the U.S. and Japan, urging Abe to learn from Germany and offer a clear apology for wartime crimes.\u00a0\u00a0\"There is no place better than the U.S. Capitol for Abe to accept the Japanese Imperial government's role in crimes against humanity during World War II, and to offer a clear and unequivocal apology to all victims,\" the letter said.\u00a0\u00a0\"We, the people of all colors, sincerely hope that Japan will overcome its shameful past by facing the historical facts, not by hiding or covering them up, and become a true champion in the global community,\" it said.\u00a0\u00a0The newspaper also said in an editorial that Abe should include \"Japan's understanding of and remorse for its wartime offenses\" in his congressional speech on Wednesday and a statement he is preparing to issue in August to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II.

As of Wednesday, more than 63,000 livestock at 63 farms nationwide had been culled, mostly in Gyeonggi Province and North Chungcheong Province, since the first reported outbreak on Dec. 5. The capital will conduct antibody tests on all livestock in national parks in the city and vaccinate all animals that have not yet been immunized, officials said. The city will also strengthen monitoring of the animals, they added. The city has run a quarantine task force since late last year to better cope with potential cases. It also launched emergency situation rooms at seven sites to enhance its quarantine response. Earlier this week, dozens of pigs at two farms in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, tested positive, quarantine authorities said. The animals were suddenly unable to stand, a common symptom of foot-and-mouth, they added. Two other cases were confirmed in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, 40 kilometers south of Seoul, the Agriculture Ministry said. The outbreak is suspected to have started in unvaccinated pigs at a farm, it added. South Korea has been hit five times by foot-and-mouth disease since 2000, with three occurrences in 2010. More than 3.4 million animals were slaughtered in the largest outbreak, in late 2010, resulting in losses of more than 2.7 trillion won ($2.5 billion).

(Yonhap)The authorities believe that the workers, employees of a demolition contractor, were in the process of detaching the machine room from the 40-ton crane. According to reports, three of the workers were cutting through structures holding the machine room in place, while another was working inside the machine room. A fifth worker assigned to the project escaped unhurt as he was overseeing the operations from the ground.

(Yonhap)","906":"French and European officials will unveil details of anti-terror measures Wednesday to counter threats of new attacks and strengthen cooperation in the wake of deadly shootings in Paris.In the French capital, on high alert since jihadist attacks left 17 dead two weeks ago, Prime Minister Manuel Valls will outline promised measures to boost security forces.The worst attack on French soil in decades put Europe on high alert and a wave of police raids, investigations and extraditions have taken place across the jittery continent.European Commissioners in Brussels will meet to discuss the 28-nation bloc's new counterterrorism strategy, including changes to the region's Schengen free travel area and intelligence cooperation.Meanwhile in Washington, President Barack Obama said the US stood side by side with terror victims around the world, citing the Paris attacks in his State of the Nation address late Tuesday.\"We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks,\" he said, vowing action against \"terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies\".Last week Valls announced the creation of special files for people linked to terrorism, and said prisoners linked to radical Islam could be isolated in jail, a hotbed for radicalisation.Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said intelligence services could receive additional funding while security forces could get more powerful weapons and improved equipment.According to a source, 400 million euros ($460 million) will go to the police for hiring, upgrading information systems and equipment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - Raids, arrests across Europe -\u00a0\u00a0 ================================\u00a0\u00a0 Four men suspected of supplying one of the gunmen behind the Paris attacks with weapons and vehicles were brought before an anti-terror judge Tuesday, the first to face possible charges over the shootings that shook France to its core.The three gunmen who carried out coordinated attacks from January 7-9 were killed in dramatic police sieges, and prosecutors are now hoping to pin down those who assisted them.Prosecutors called Tuesday for the men believed to have supplied gunman Amedy Coulibaly with weapons and vehicles to remain in detention and be charged with conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.Coulibaly was behind the murder of four hostages at a Jewish supermarket and the murder of a policewoman after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi gunned down 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The attacks prompted a flurry of police activity across Europe.In Germany some 200 police carried out raids on 13 apartments in Berlin and other locations to find evidence against two men arrested last week for allegedly backing jihadist violence in Syria.This followed raids in Belgium last week that foiled potential attacks against police officers, and led to arrests in several European countries.Greece on Tuesday ordered the extradition of a 33-year-old Algerian man with suspected links to the jihadist cell dismantled in Belgium.The suspected mastermind of the plot, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 27-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent, remains at large.And in Bulgaria, a court ruled that a Frenchman who knew two of the Paris attackers should be returned to his home country.France had issued an arrest warrant for Muslim convert Fritz-Joly Joachin, 29, who denies being an extremist but was detained after trying to cross from Bulgaria into Turkey before the attacks.In southern France, five Russians from Chechnya were arrested on Tuesday with what police described as a dangerous amount of explosives, although the case was believed to be linked to organised crime and not radical Islam.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - Boosted security measures -\u00a0\u00a0 =============================\u00a0\u00a0 Many EU states have pushed for a US-style database of air travellers' details on the grounds that it would help track Islamist suspects, but the European Parliament has so far blocked the scheme saying it would breach civil liberties.Some European nations have also been pushing for a tightening of the Schengen visa-free zone.\"They will discuss subjects including passenger name records and data retention, the functioning of the Schengen area and cooperation between security services,\" Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a briefing on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's meeting.The fallout from the attacks has led to massive protests in Muslim countries, furious after Charlie Hebdo magazine responded to the killing of its staff by publishing a new cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed.Banned by Islam, the depiction of the prophet was taken as a searing insult to Muslims who burned French flags, and threatened the country in protests that have taken place in Chechnya, Afghanistan, Gaza, Iran and Pakistan. In Niger protests turned deadly as 10 people died and dozens of churches were torched.The attacks have forced France to face up to its failure to integrate poorer, migrant families, with Valls admitting on Tuesday that the country was plagued by \"social and ethnic apartheid\". (AFP)","907":"With Hong Kong increasingly polarised on political reforms and fears growing over the influence of Beijing, frustrated residents are pressing former colonial power Britain to offer them an escape route.Their push for a new status that would allow them right of abode in Britain reflects their anger over what they see as a lack of support from the UK in their time of need. It follows more than two months of pro-democracy protests, which failed to win concessions from the government on the way the city's next leader is elected, and ties in with concerns that civil liberties are being chipped away.Before Britain gave the city back to China in 1997 it offered Hong Kongers a special \"British National Overseas\" status to calm those worried about their future under Beijing's rule.Holders can enter the UK without a visa and get consular assistance abroad, but have no right to live in Britain.Around 400,000 Hong Kong residents hold the BNO passport and some are now calling on Britain to allow them residency as they seek to escape rising tensions.\"It is an extra option for Hong Kong people -- it's a right they deserve,\" says Sampson Noble, a 30-year-old Hong Kong Chinese resident who runs the BritishHongKong campaign group.\"I was born British,\" he added. \"It should not relate to my ethnicity.\"The group's forum has 3,000 members and has sent letters to British lawmakers, as well as a statement to a UK parliamentary inquiry into Hong Kong's post-handover relationship with Britain.In that statement the group called Britain's stance \"discriminative\".\"We were ruled for 156 years and we are being discriminated against,\" said Humphrey Lau, a campaigner for the group.\"There is a feeling of being betrayed.\"Popular Facebook page \"BNO Concern\", which also calls for right of abode, has 6,000 likes with users dismissing their status as \"rubbish\" and pushing for change.Twenty- and thirty-somethings are particularly frustrated, says political columnist Martin Oei. \"Young people are disappointed to see how Hong Kong is greatly affected by the 'Chinese way',\" he said.\"People now want to think of a way out.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - Desperate measure -\u00a0\u00a0 =====================\u00a0\u00a0 Before the handover, 50,000 selected Hong Kongers -- mainly white-collar professionals and civil servants -- were given British passports, but more than three million had to make do with BNO status.Signing up was optional and the status can be held alongside a Chinese passport. Applying was only possible before the handover, but holders can renew their BNO every 10 years for around HK$1,000 ($130).For 33-year-old Peter, a pilot, renewing his BNO passport is a desperate measure.\"(It) is just like someone who is drowning would grasp whatever he can reach,\" he told AFP, saying the recent democracy protests spurred him to renew the document.The rallies were sparked by Beijing's insistence that candidates in the city's 2017 leadership vote must be vetted by a loyalist committee, which critics dismiss as \"fake democracy\".Attacks on outspoken media figures and the arrests of protest leaders have added to fears that Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status is eroding. Peter told AFP the failed protests proved \"how we are ignored by our government and how helpless we Hong Kong people are\". \"The BNO passport may save me one day, when Hong Kong is no longer a place for us and we cannot call ourselves Hong Kong people any more,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - Saving face -\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 =================\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the growing calls, there is no sign that Britain will budge.\"There are currently no plans to amend British Nationality legislation to give holders of BNO status the Right of Abode in the UK, or to extend the right to apply for BNO status,\" a consulate spokeswoman told AFP.Critics are sceptical that Britain would ever risk its relationship with China over Hong Kong. UK Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire suggested the strictly-controlled election offered by Beijing could be \"better than nothing at all\", as he gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry on Hong Kong last week. The creation of BNO status was itself widely seen as a bid to keep China happy by not offering Hong Kongers alternative citizenship. It also prevented an influx into Britain. \"The key was to save face on the diplomatic arrangements,\" says Chung Kim-wah, assistant professor of social science at Hong Kong's Polytechnic University.\"The benefits for Hong Kong were not a primary concern.\"Chung said young people's current discontent was \"embarrassing\" for China.The older generation are demanding change, too -- Hong Kong residents who served Britain as soldiers have taken their call for right of abode to the UK parliament. Unless large numbers of BNO-holders can \"create noise internationally\" there is little chance of change, says Chung.But for campaigners like Lau, there is no choice but to keep up the pressure.\"If we stop it, we'll get nothing,\" he said. (AFP)","908":"South Korea rebuked Japan Wednesday over the distribution of a Korean-language version of its defense white paper depicting Seoul's easternmost islets of Dokdo as Japanese territory.The defense ministry said it summoned the military attache from the Japanese Embassy in Seoul earlier in the day to protest Japan's act to hand out the summary of its defense paper that laid territorial claim to the Dokdo islets.\"The Seoul government lodged a strong protest against Japan in order to prevent such an unjustifiable act from being repeated,\" an official at the defense ministry told reporters.The Dokdo islets, which lie closer to South Korea than Japan in waters between the two countries, have been a thorny bilateral issue. South Korea keeps a small police detachment on the islets.South Korea has rejected Japan's claim to Dokdo as nonsense because the country regained its independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule and reclaimed sovereignty over its territories, including Dokdo and many other islands around the Korean Peninsula.Tokyo has asserted its claim to Dokdo in its defense report for the past 10 years, but this marks the first time that Japan has unveiled the Korean version of its white paper containing the claim.The summary for 2014 has a map showing the Dokdo islets marked as Japanese territory. In 2013, the report translated into the Korean language did not include such a territorial claim.A Japanese military attache delivered about 50 copies of the summary to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff last week, which passed them on to the defense ministry earlier this week, according to the ministry. \u00a0\"We returned the copies when summoning the Japanese envoy,\" the official said.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have reached their lowest ebb in recent years due to Japan's stance on historical grievances and its territorial claims to Dokdo.\u00a0This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties, but Japan's refusal to sincerely apologize for its wartime atrocities has impeded the improvement of the relations, clouding the possibility of a summit among the nations' political leaders. (Yonhap)","909":"Japan\u2019s national interests could be eventually undermined unless it heeds calls for resolving a long-standing issue of wartime sex slaves that continues to fray Tokyo\u2019s ties with its neighbors, a South Korean scholar warned Tuesday.Seok Tong-youn, secretary-general of the Seoul-based Northeast Asian History Foundation, also blasted some right-wing nationalists in Japan for trying to obliterate the Japanese military\u2019s system of sexual slavery during World War II, denouncing the move as \u201cnonsense.\u201dHistorians say up to 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese military brothels during the war when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony. Those sex slaves were euphemistically described by the Japanese military as \u201ccomfort women.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line of Japan\u2019s wartime sex slavery is that Japan systematically mobilized women to perform during the war and the human rights of many women were abused,\u201d Seok said in his article, which was also published in the Chinese language by a Hong Kong-based newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, on Friday.\u201cIf the Japanese government of Shinzo Abe continues to take steps toward the wrong path and cause friction with neighboring countries, it will eventually undermine Japan\u2019s own national interests,\u201d Seok said. Japan has yet to atone properly for its wartime sexual slavery and has not paid direct compensation to any of the victims. Earlier this month, Japan\u2019s foreign ministry asked an American publisher to change references of the victims of wartime sex slavery, in a fresh bid to whitewash Japan\u2019s record of wartime atrocities abroad.South Korea has pressed Japan to address long-running grievances by the victims of wartime sex slavery by extending a formal apology and compensating them. But Japan has refused to do so, saying the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations between the two countries.Little progress was reported in this week\u2019s new round of talks between Seoul and Tokyo over wartime sex slavery. (Yonhap)","910":"A group of test-takers of the 2013 college entrance exam lodged a lawsuit against the government, demanding to be compensated for the damages inflicted upon them by a flawed question.The case was the first claim for damages filed by students concerning errors in the state-commissioned annual exam, dubbed the \u201cSuneung\u201d in Korea. After the 2013 exams in November, four test-takers challenged the accuracy of a world geography question. The Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, in charge of making the questions, refused to recognize the error and engaged in a yearlong legal battle with the students. In October, a Seoul court ruled in favor of the students and the government subsequently proposed a set of measures to offset the damages. These included granting college admission to some students who failed to enter the colleges of their choice due to the flawed question.But the plaintiffs \u2015 100 students who had taken the world geography test \u2015 said Monday that they were substantially penalized by errors in college admission. They blamed the state and the KICE, saying their reluctance to admit their faults ultimately worsened the damage caused by the error. \u201cThe flaw of the cited question could have been easily determined through statistics. The KICE had ample time to admit the errors and minimize the damage, but they did not,\u201d the students said in their petition.According to Kim Hyeon-cheol, their legal representative, the focus of the lawsuit is not the error itself but the defendants\u2019 attitude after the students challenged the question. The total compensation requested by the students comes to 2.34 billion won ($2.16 million). As of Tuesday, 450 students across the country said they intended to take part in the lawsuit.The grades of 18,884 students nationwide were affected by the flawed question. The incident is widely considered one of the worst Suneung-related disputes since the national exam was introduced in 1994. In the aftermath of the public uproar that followed, which was stoked by the discovery of two more flawed questions in the 2014 exams, the Education Ministry vowed to announce a reform plan by March.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","911":"Rival political parties agreed Tuesday to convene an extra parliamentary session next month to handle pending bills, including one aimed at rooting out corruption among public officials.The special session will run from Feb. 2 to Mar. 3 and include interpellation sessions from Feb. 10-13 and two plenary sessions on Feb. 26 and Mar. 3.The agreement was reached during a weekly meeting between the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.The upcoming session's top priority is expected to be a bill that calls for punishing public officials who are caught taking money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($922) even if they were not in exchange for favors.The bill is intended to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules that punish public officials only when they receive bribes in connection with their work.Critics have argued that the bill could make civil servants reluctant to perform their duties due to the fear of punishment. (Yonhap)","912":"A worker at Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant died Tuesday after falling into a water tank, the country's nuclear operator said, the second fatal accident to blight efforts to stabilise the tsunami-battered facility.Separately on Tuesday, another worker died because of an incident at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant, which is located several kilometres south of the damaged plant, operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said.The victim at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, reportedly in his 50s, was inspecting an empty water tank with two other workers when he fell from the top of the 10-meter container, according to TEPCO.The worker was trying to remove the lid of the giant tank by himself when he fell into the unit.\"He was wearing a harness, but the hook was found tucked inside the harness. This means the harness was not being used,\" said a TEPCO spokesman.\"We are investigating whether safety measures were appropriately observed,\" he added.The tank is one of thousands at the site used to store rain water that may have picked up radiation at the battered site.The worker is the second to die during efforts to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after reactors went into meltdown in the aftermath of a huge tsunami in March 2011.Last March, a worker died after being buried in earth and rubble while digging a hole.While the earthquake and tsunami it caused four years ago killed more than 18,000 people, no one is officially recorded as having died as a direct result of radiation released by Fukushima's broken reactors.In the unrelated incident at the Fukushima Daini plant, which was largely unscathed by the huge natural disaster, a worker died after suffering a severe head injury after being caught in equipment, a TEPCO spokesman said. (AFP)","913":"The main opposition party vowed Tuesday to review the government's new tax settlement scheme amid public anger over the larger tax burden for middle and lower income groups.The revised tax scheme aims to collect less taxes throughout the year and return less in overcharge during tax settlements at the start of a new year.The government's stated goal is to enhance the distribution of wealth, but the new scheme has also resulted in some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,733) having to pay more in taxes. Before the revision, many wage earners were able to get tax refunds that were commonly referred to as a bonus or extra wage. \"We will actively study policies to relieve the tax burden, raise tax equity and restore the corporate tax rate to normal levels,\" Rep. Woo Yoon-keun, the floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said during a party meeting. South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the previous Lee Myung-bak administration.\"The warehouses of conglomerates are overflowing, while the glass wallets of ordinary citizens are being emptied,\" he said.\"Glass wallet\" is a term used to describe the \"transparent\" income of ordinary wage earners.Woo accused President Park Geun-hye's conservative administration of favoring large businesses at the expense of average wage earners, citing data that the corporate reserves of conglomerates amounted to 552 trillion won last year, double the amount five years earlier.The opposition party will study ways to revise the law to raise the tax credit rate from 15 percent to 20 percent during next month's extra parliamentary session, he added.The ruling Saenuri Party expressed frustration as the government's efforts to defuse the controversy only invited stronger criticism.In a hastily arranged press conference earlier in the day, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the extra money collected, mainly from high-income earners, would be used to finance two government programs aimed at helping low-income self-employed workers and encouraging people to have more children. He also said the government will consider adjusting tax deduction categories to give more benefits to families with children and help people prepare for retirement.\"The government shouldn't be bent on temporarily stitching up the problem but think carefully about how to address the public's mistrust in the fairness of the tax system and come up with a solution as soon as possible,\" Kim Young-woo, the ruling party's senior spokesman, said in a press briefing. \"The Saenuri Party will do its best to find a more reasonable way that strikes a balance between welfare and the tax burden.\"President Park Geun-hye also addressed the controversy.\"It's important that (the public) thoroughly understand (the issue),\" she told Choi ahead of a Cabinet meeting at the presidential office earlier in the day. (Yonhap)","914":"Barack Obama faces the massed ranks of Congress on Tuesday for the first time since his party lost control there, but don't expect him to cut a humbler figure.Borne on a tide of optimistic economic data, Obama will use the State of the Union address to taunt his Republican rivals with an ambitious tax plan that they will never agree to pass.In doing so, Obama will set the tone for the battles to come both in Congress and on the campaign trail, as Republican and Democrat hopefuls limber up for the battle to replace him.The US leader no longer commands a majority in either house of Congress, but the failure of his legislative program will not stop him using it as a stage to celebrate his successes.Unemployment has dropped below six percent, the stock market is back near record levels, growth is at its highest in 11 years and gas prices have plummeted for middle-class motorists.With all this to commend him, Obama will use Tuesday's speech to propose redistributive tax reforms that will cheer his disappointed base and enrage his entrenched opponents.\"The 400 richest taxpayers paid an average tax rate below 17 percent in 2012, lower than many middle-class families,\" the White House noted last week in a briefing paper on the plan.Obama's plan was necessary, his office argued, because the \"tax code is unfair, allowing the rich to play by different rules.\"Under his reform, extra taxes on capital gains targeting just the wealthiest 0.1 percent of people -- those earning more than $2 million per year-- would pay off 80 percent of new revenue. \"By ensuring those at the top pay their fair share in taxes, the president's plan responsibly pays for investments we need to help middle class families get ahead,\" the paper said.This would notably be used to lower college fees for poorer students, but it was laughed out of court by Republican budget hawks.\"This is not a serious proposal,\" scoffed Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Congressman Paul Ryan, a former vice-presidential candidate and lead Republican budget negotiator.\"We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending,\" Buck argued, in remarks echoed across his party.\u00a0\u00a0 - Poll bounce -\u00a0\u00a0 ===============So what hope is there for Obama's bold plan to spend the fruits of a rising economy -- and taxing the rich -- on free community colleges, help for first-time homeowners and subsidized, high-speed Internet?The latest opinion polls suggest that if Obama is not in a position to impose his plan, he can at least force Republicans to pay a political price for opposing him.Meanwhile, he has used his executive authority to the limit -- opponents would argue stretched it to the limit -- to impose or oppose some policies by decree.The new Congress has made one of its first priorities to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada, an idea Obama has said he will veto out of hand if experts says it will damage the environment.On the foreign policy front, he has announced moves to normalize relations with Cuba and pushed on with talks with Iran on its nuclear program, in defiance of conservative foreign policy foes.Polls suggest Americans support the Cuban outreach and Obama will hammer home his advantage by inviting newly freed US citizen Alan Gross, a former prisoner in Cuba, to the speech.Coincidentally -- or not -- the State of the Union falls on the same day as US envoys begin new talks in Havana on restoring ties, and Obama will push Congress to end the trade embargo.He won't get everything he wants, and much angry politicking lies ahead in the years before his next and last State of the Union, but Obama is already enjoying a popularity bounce.The latest ABC\/Washington Post monthly poll published Sunday saw Obama's approval rating up nine to 50 percent, against 44 percent who thought he was doing a bad job, a 10-point drop in disapproval.Why? It's the economy... as ever. Just three months ago, only 27 percent of Americans thought the economy in good health. Now, 41 percent do.

Claiming the exclusion of the DVDs as a warning to North Korea, Park said the group will spread a massive amount of \"The Interview\" DVDs if the North is not cooperative with South Korea's dialogue offer and its proposal for a reunion of separated families.The activist group often flies leaflets carrying anti-regime messages in big plastic balloons across the border in a bid to spread dissenting messages in the reclusive communist country. Park had pledged to add the DVDs to their campaigns this month.The Monday action came despite South Korea's calls on the activist group to scrap their campaigns after the North's repeated threats of retaliation. In a news interview released earlier on Tuesday, Park indicated his intention to push ahead with the DVD campaign. \"The Interview\" DVDs would not be scrapped without an official government request,\" the activist group head said. \"I have previously vowed to accept if a person in charge of government administration requests restraint in the form of an official letter, but no such request has been made,\" Park said in an interview with Washington-based Radio Free Asia. \"We are in a position in which we cannot refrain from the plan only upon a verbal request from the government,\" he said.The South Korean government has maintained that on principle it will not interfere with the campaign because it is a matter of freedom of speech, although it may take action to prevent any safety risks that might result from the activities.Last week, a high-level government official met with Park face-to-face and verbally advised him against a future campaign. On Tuesday, a unification ministry official again reiterated its stance that \"Leaflet spreading by private groups belongs to a sphere of the basic freedom of expression, therefore the government cannot force them (to stop) and the private sector should decide for themselves.\" \"The government will take necessary action only in case clear risks are posed to the safety of citizens in the concerned region,\" the official said, adding that the government plans to continue to call for discretion from activists.The release of the U.S. comedy film, which revolves around an American TV producer and a show host's trip to North Korea to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has previously drawn angry reaction from the communist country.

Almost 50 percent of them said they were willing to put their family\u2019s needs above their own once tying the knot.\u00a0Young people account for 19 percent of the entire Korean population as of this year, according to data. However, the youth population has been on a constant decline over the last four decades. In the 1970s, they accounted for 35.1 percent of the population and 21.2 percent in 2010.

Koreans aged 65 or older accounted for 12.6 percent of the total population in 2013, and the proportion of the elderly is forecast to exceed 20 percent by 2026 and 50 percent by 2100. While the majority of youths were open to the idea of living unmarried with a partner, 68.8 percent said they were currently happy with their family life. More than 45 percent said they were not the only ones who should be responsible for supporting their parents in their post-retirement years. They said society and the government should also financially support the elderly, along with their family members. More than 60 percent said they were currently stressed in general, while 50.5 percent said they were unsatisfied with their school life. The biggest number of them, 35.3 percent, said they were most stressed about schoolwork and academic pressure, while 25.6 percent were most worried about their future careers. The leading cause of death among Korean youths last year was suicide, followed by traffic accidents and cancer.More than 10 percent of the surveyed young people said they had run away from home.

Those who served in the military for 20 years are eligible to receive a pension no matter how old they are at the time of retirement.For example, a 39-year-old officer who retires after 20 years in service is expected to receive his annuity for more than 38 years if he dies at 77, the average life span of a South Korean man. After his death, his bereaved family can receive the money for an additional 24 years.As of 2013, the data said that two receivers were in their 30s and 2,550 were under 50.They said that the fund's deficit will widen in the coming years due to a longer life span.The Seoul government announced a plan last year to reform the military fund, as well as the public officials' pension but put off the project due to a fierce backlash.\"The military pension needs to adopt a pension-peak system to reduce payments after a certain period,\" said Kim Sun-taek, the president of the KTI.

Spain is serving as a nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council this year, which gives Spain decision-making powers on North Korea issues. Spain supports Korea\u2019s unification efforts on all fronts. It is \u201cdestined to happen sooner or later,\u201d Ortiz said. Ortiz praised Korea\u2019s strong presence on the international stage despite the small size of the country.\u201cBut it is difficult for foreign companies to invest in Korea, as the Korean market is still relatively closed and riddled with regulations.\u201d The ambassador emphasized that Spain\u2019s economy is set for a \u201cremarkable recovery\u201d this year, bouncing back from the repercussions of the 2008 global financial crisis. The gross domestic product growth rate was estimated to be 1.4 percent in 2014 \u2015 the highest in the eurozone \u2015 and is expected to pick up in the coming years, according to Ortiz. \u201cOur government has undertaken a series of reforms in the state budget, financial institutions and labor market to increase competitiveness,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThis year may not see the end of our economic crisis, but our microeconomic performances will improve through the reforms.\u201dSpain has world-leading companies in infrastructure, engineering, renewable energy, biotechnology, machinery and automobile sectors. Its exports to Korea \u2015 mainly mineral fuels, automotive parts, machinery, pharmaceutical products, clothes, pork, olive oil and wine \u2015 amounted to $1.4 billion in 2013 and $2.5 billion in 2014.

Gramegna, who was Luxembourg\u2019s ambassador to Korea and Japan between 1996 and 2002, visited Seoul for two days to invigorate bilateral investment in the financial industry. Gramegna told The Korea Herald in an interview that he received \u201cencouraging impulses\u201d from Mayor Park Won-soon, Financial Services Commission Chairman Shin Je-yoon of and heads of major Korean banks. He also met executives of 20 Korean financial technology companies.\u201cLuxembourg\u2019s international financial center welcomes Korean investments in the banking, investment funds, insurance and corporate finance industries,\u201d Gramegna said. \u201cWith financial reforms undertaken last year, most notably the abolishment of bank secrecy laws, we have set a path for financial stability and transparency in taxation.\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna spoke to the media last week during a visit to invigorate bilateral investment in the financial industry.

Luxembourg is the world\u2019s largest cross-border fund distribution center and the second-largest investment fund center after the U.S. Luxembourg has the world\u2019s second-highest per capita gross domestic product, at $80,000. Gramegna said that his government\u2019s \u201cstrategic decision\u201d to nurture the financial industries following the steel industry\u2019s decline in the 1970s has made the economy highly productive.Luxembourg\u2019s financial industry accounted for 12 percent of the country\u2019s workforce and 25 percent of gross domestic product, Gramegna said, while the services sectors made up 85 percent of GDP. The minister pointed to his country\u2019s financial technology industry \u2015 a line of electronic commerce and payment businesses using software for their services \u2015 which has seen marked growth in recent years. \u201cIt represents 10,000 jobs, out of which 20 percent belong to the world\u2019s top 100 companies in the fintech industry,\u201d he said. Leading global companies including Skype, Amazon and PayPal have set up offices in Luxembourg; and Korea\u2019s largest gaming company, Nexon, established its European headquarters there in November 2010.

He said ``it's two ways of taking each other's temperature.''\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. and North Korea have no formal diplomatic ties, but former U.S. officials occasionally meet the North's diplomats in a bid to settle the impasse over Pyongyang's pursuit of a long-range nuclear-armed missile that could hit the U.S. mainland.\u00a0\u00a0 North Korea's team was led by Ri Yong Ho, the chief negotiator for six-party denuclearization talks.\u00a0\u00a0 North Korea has indicated willingness to rejoin the long-stalled talks, but has balked at U.S. demands it first take concrete steps to show it remains committed to the denuclearization goal.\u00a0\u00a0 Earlier this month, North Korea told the United States that it was willing to impose a temporary moratorium on its nuclear tests if Washington scraps planned military drills with South Korea this year. Washington called the linking of the military drills with a possible nuclear test ``an implicit threat,'' but said it was open to dialogue with North Korea.\u00a0\u00a0 Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs and has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006. But experts are divided on how far the opaque government has come in the technology needed to miniaturize a warhead.\u00a0\u00a0 Asked whether the two sides would also discuss recent hacking attacks linked to the comedy flick ``The Interview,'' Sigal said, ``I don't think we will get into that very much.''\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. blames the North for crippling cyberattacks on Sony Entertainment, which released the movie depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and subsequently imposed new sanctions on the country. Pyongyang has denied responsibility for the cyberattacks and accused the U.S. of engineering recent Internet disruptions in the country.\u00a0\u00a0 Others taking part in the Singapore talks, which go on until Monday, include former U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Bosworth, former deputy nuclear negotiator Joseph DeTrani and Tony Namkung, former deputy director at Berkeley's Institute for East Asian Studies.

His disappearance was reported by his co-traveler to the embassy, which later sent its officials to the area to find him.The official noted that it was the co-traveler who reported the teenager's disappearance to the embassy.He said that the co-traveler is now under the custody of the South Korean embassy for further investigation.In Seoul, the teenager's mother said her son had exchanged emails with his Turkish friend named Hassan whom he met on the Internet, according to South Korean police.Quoting the teenager's parents, police said the son visited Turkey together with one of his parent's church members.Police said an analysis of the missing teenager's phone records showed no evidence that he has had any contact with IS.The mother also told police that South Korean intelligence officials analyzed the teenager's computer, but they did not find anything that could link his son with IS.The South Korean Foreign Ministry also said there is no evidence to prove that the teenager has crossed the border into Syria and joined IS.

The leaflet campaign targeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been a constant source of friction between the two Koreas.North Korea has openly threatened to retaliate against organizers of the leaflet campaigns who are mostly defectors from the North. But the Seoul government has refused to intervene, citing the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.But the Seoul government appears to be changing its position on the issue following a court ruling last month that government authorities can intervene and stop the leaflet campaign if it threatens the safety of people living in border areas.The move by Lee's group came one day after the Unification Ministry separately met heads of the two civic groups and requested them to refrain from flying the leaflets.Lee, in response, said\u00a0 his group will honor the government's suggestion but stressed that there will be no \"drastic\" cut in the frequency of the leaflet campaign, however.Park Sang-hak, also a North Korean defector who heads the other activist group that leads the campaign, said he is considering suspending his plan to send DVDs of a Hollywood film about a fictional plot to kill the North Korean leader across the border by balloon, according to sources.The head of the Fighters for a Free North Korea earlier had said he was planning to send 100,000 copies of Sony Pictures' \"The Interview,\" which the North condemned as a deal-breaker, around Tuesday.In a New Year Day address, the North Korean leader said he is willing to hold summit talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye but said Seoul must first create a good atmosphere for dialogue by halting the leaflet campaign and joint military exercises with the United States.South and North Korea are in a state of conflict after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an uneasy armistice, not in a peace treaty.

The new year also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to the lowest levels in recent years mainly due to the sex slavery issue. Historians estimate the number of such sex slaves at about 200,000 with only about 50 South Korean victims alive today.Japan angered Seoul and Beijing, victims of Tokyo's wartime aggression, in June by saying that its 1993 apology over the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, was the outcome of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will express remorse over Japan's role in the war in his fresh statement that will come on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat of World War II.But many analysts predict that the premier will not apologize for the sex slavery issue and may water down the spirit of Japan's 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Since taking office in early 2013, South Korean President Park Geun-hye has shunned a summit with Abe as a show of anger against Tokyo's refusal to atone for its historical wrongdoings.In her New Year press conference on Monday, Park urged Japan to face up to history, warning that the issue could be a \"big burden\" on Japan unless it is quickly resolved.

A recent report by the Educational Testing Service showed that Korea\u2019s IBT TOEFL were among the lowest among members of the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, especially in the speaking section, on which only Japan and Turkey performed worse.The percentage of students who thought English classes in school were not sufficient increased as students got older \u2015 from 60.6 percent among first year middle school students to 74.7 percent among high school seniors.On the contrary, 84.4 percent of students thought private education helped them study English, and 73.2 percent said they would get private education if they can.Naturally, the biggest reason for getting private education was \u201cbecause I can\u2019t speak English well by just taking school classes,\u201d 40.7 percent of the students said. The report showed that students are turning to private education due to their lack of trust in the public education system. Koreans are estimated to spend about 6.3 trillion won ($5.8 billion) annually on English private education, which is the highest of all subjects.\u201cThe government needs to provide accurate information about policies regarding English education to parents, who play a pivotal role in deciding whether or not students will get private education,\u201d said Jeong Yu-gyeong, lead author of the survey, who teaches at Dongduk Girls\u2019 Middle School.\u201cIt must also expand training programs for English teachers, so they can offer well-balanced classes.\u201dIn a bid to tackle the high cost of English education, the Education Ministry last year said it would implement an absolute grading system for the English section of the annual college exam in place of the existing curved grading system. But some experts raised questions about whether the measure would be effective, as it may simply intensify the competition in other subjects like math or Korean language.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","938":"South Korea renewed its call on the North on Wednesday to accept its December offer to hold high-level talks as the communist country has remained silent on the overture for over two weeks.\"(The government) once again calls on North Korea to come to the negotiating table immediately,\" unification ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said in a regular briefing.For the moment, the government intends to wait for an answer from the North over the offer without making another official proposal, the spokesman noted.On Dec. 29, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae officially proposed the two Koreas hold a high-level dialogue to discuss pending issues, including a need for holding a reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.In her national address earlier this week, President Park Geun-hye again prodded the North to come to the negotiating table to discuss holding the reunion event during the Lunar New Year's holiday season that falls in mid-February.The North, however, has yet to respond to the offer as of Wednesday while calling on the South to try to improve inter-Korean relations.North Korea's mainstream Rodong Sinmun newspaper published a group of articles in its Wednesday issue under the title \"Write a new history of North-South relations through the unity of the people,\" calling for measures on the part of Seoul to resolve tension on the peninsula.In the articles, the North urged the South Korean government to stop anti-Pyongyang policies, including the civil-led campaign to spread dissenting messages near the border.\"If (Seoul) sticks to confrontational policies and emotions of animosity and distrust rather than showing trust, talks cannot take place, and even when talks do take place, they will only be temporary,\" the newspaper noted in English.The newspaper also highlighted three previous inter-Korean joint declarations that call for efforts for a peaceful unification of the two Koreas.Seoul and Pyongyang have issued three joint declarations, including the most recent one in 2007 between late South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, in efforts to facilitate peace on the peninsula.With the North continuing to repeat such a call since the talks offer two weeks ago, experts said that the recent rhetoric may be intended to assert its position ahead of a possible dialogue with the South.In a separate section, the North Korean newspaper also called on the United States to end its hostile policy toward the communist country.The recent U.S. sanctions on the North imposed over the alleged hacking into Sony Pictures are a scheme to drive a wedge between the two Koreas, the newspaper said.\"The U.S. has deliberately encouraged confrontations and a bloody war mode whenever there were signs of less tension on the Korean Peninsula,\" the Rodong Sinmun noted, adding that the U.S. government should end its hostility toward Pyongyang. (Yonhap)","939":"A series of cracks and subsidence recently discovered on roads near Lotte World Tower have been found not dangerous, the Seoul municipal government said Wednesday, amid lingering concerns over the skyscraper's safety.Last week, city officials said they had detected the cracks and subsidence in three areas near the 123-story tower under construction in southeastern Seoul. The skyscraper's lower floors opened in October amid public skepticism over its safety.Wrapping up a week-long inspection, however, officials said experts have found these cracks and subsidence to be \"like any other cracks you see on normal streets\" and not indicative of sinkholes.Several road sections affected by subsidence will be inspected further and repaired, they added.This was the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked public concerns over the tower, which will be the tallest structure in South Korea when completed in 2016.Last year, reports of sinkholes and the falling water level of a lake nearby spurred questions over the tower's safety, but authorities have yet to determine a clear link between the facility and either issue.In December, the aquarium in the lower floors was found to be leaking and a construction worker died while apparently trying to climb a scaffold, an incident over which Lotte Group apologized.

Diplomatic efforts by China, North Korea's long-time ally, have still been seen as more accommodating toward Pyongyang. (Yonhap)","941":"South Korea and the United States plan to carry out a large-scale joint military exercise in early March, a source here said Tuesday, despite North Korea's recent calls for halting joint drills this year.Last week, Pyongyang sent a message to Washington expressing its will to temporarily suspend nuclear tests if the U.S. halts its joint military exercises with South Korea this year, though the U.S. effectively spurned the offer.The military source said Key Resolve, one of the two major annual combined exercises on the Korean Peninsula between the allies, \"is scheduled to take place in early March to check and boost their joint readiness posture.\" The war game used to take place in late February.The remark came after the local daily Hankook Ilbo reported Tuesday, citing a government official, that Seoul and Washington have agreed to delay the Key Resolve exercise by about a week, a move believed to factor in recent developments in inter-Korean ties.In a nationally televised news conference on Monday, South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope for the two Koreas to hold a new round of reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, around Lunar New Year's Day, which falls on Feb. 19.Seoul's defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok, however, denied the report, saying that the exercise schedule was fixed a long time ago. \"It has nothing to do with possible family reunions, though the exact date of when to begin the drill is subject to change.\"In a brief e-mail statement, U.S. Forces Korea said South Korea and the U.S. \"are preparing for exercise Key Resolve ... Key Resolve focuses on crisis management and command and control of alliance forces. More information on the exercise will be available at a later date.\"The North has called on the U.S. and South Korea to stop joint military drills, claiming that they are a rehearsal for a northward invasion. But the allies have vowed to continue the exercises, as they are defensive in nature.The drill usually involves tens of thousands of troops from both sides.

(If we don\u2019t proceed with the reform), the current system would require 10 trillion won in government subsidies over 10 years,\u201d Park said, calling on the parties to draw up reform plans by April.\u201cThis would likely leave our next generation with 484 trillion won worth of debt, which means a single citizen would have to pay off 9.45 million won 10 years later.\u201dAccording to the reform proposal submitted by the Ministry of Public Administration last year, all public employees will have to pay 43 percent more in premiums and receive 34 percent less in pension payouts, starting from 2016.

According to the workers, the proposal was jointly created by the Saenuri Party and the Korean Pension Association \u2015 a group of pension experts, many of whom are associated with private insurance companies, including Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance.

This year\u2019s event was organized by the Seoul Design Foundation and supported by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to become the first comprehensive design festival held in Korea. Organizers combined all of the design-focused programs to be held in Seoul so far, such as the Seoul Design Festival, Herald Design Forum, and Design Market, into one great festival event, turning Seoul\u2019s entire downtown area into a huge festival venue.Seoul Design Week 2014 was planned to increase synergy in the design industry by combining all of the diverse design-related programs held in the citizen sector and promote the brand of Seoul as a global design city.The event provided the citizens of Seoul with exciting opportunities to relish bountiful feasts of design through a variety of events, including seminars, exhibitions, and markets, prepared by some of the world\u2019s most celebrated designers and successful business people.The Seoul Design Festival, held in COEX Mall, for instance, attracted wide public attention thanks to its special exhibitions focused on future-oriented design, such as \u201c3D printing.\u201d A total of over 90 thousand citizens visited the venue and participated in the various festival programs held for five days, making it the most popular of all the design-related events held in Korea today. Participants were particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity offered to them to participate in a seminar that included some of the world\u2019s most famous designers and leading figures in design entrepreneurship, such as Paul Cocksedge and Francesca Veronesi.\u00a0Citizens also showed great enthusiasm for the Seoul Design Spot Tour as it effectively offered open studios for the the designers, in many parts of downtown Seoul. These \u201cdesign spots\u201d, fifteen in total, provided citizens with experience-focused events on a variety of topics, including urban beekeeping and calligraphy.As for design students, the Herald Design Forum was a dream come true as it was included the participation of some of the world\u2019s most celebrated designers and architects, such as Remment Koolhaas, Jeff Vandeberg, Olivier Theyskens, and Chris Riggs. The Herald Design Market, opened in connection with the forum, appealed to those interested in design intended to aid in a more comfortable and practical lifestyle, with food and kitchenware promoting health and well-being.\u00a0In his congratulatory speech for the Herald Design Forum, Mayor of Seoul Park Won-sun stressed the importance and value of design, saying: \u201c\u2018Design thinking\u2019 based on humanism, empathy, creativity and innovation can produce solutions to various problems.\u201dOrganizers of Seoul Design Week 2014 found their event very successful in that its various design-focused events helped to create synergy through cooperation, which would have lasting influence.

Ahn, who hails from the region, will deliver the goods worth some 200 million won ($186,000) by land on Tuesday and assess the project\u2019s progress until Saturday together with a team of seven technicians and officials. The announcement marks South Korea\u2019s first fertilizer assistance to the impoverished neighbor since it imposed bilateral sanctions on cross-border trade, investment, travel and other exchanges following the North\u2019s deadly attacks on a corvette and border island in 2010. The last package by a private group was authorized in April the same year. State-level support has not taken place since 2007, although humanitarian aid directed at women and children has continued.Ahn expressed gratitude for the decision, saying his project would provide a \u201cchance to look to the future where our people reconcile and work together.\u201d The foundation has been running a greenhouse farm there since 2009 at a 33,000 square meter area to boost agricultural production and technology transfers. It has since installed 100 greenhouses and is expected to scale it up to 300. Along with cement and heavy equipment, fertilizers and grains such as rice and flour remain sensitive items due to concerns that they can be stored for a relatively long time and thus the communist regime may divert them for military and other unintended uses through resale to other countries. President Park Geun-hye vowed wider humanitarian assistance and proposed a joint agricultural complex in her speech in Dresden, Germany, last March, but her initiative has made little headway amid persistent cross-border tension. \u201cThe government will approve humanitarian aid to North Korea such as for those in agricultural and diary sectors, if they are conducted in a transparent way and in the interest of the North Koreans,\u201d a foundation spokesperson said.

And he will meet with the chief executives of some of the Fortune 500 Indian companies to discuss \"constraints and inhibitions on advancing the economic partnership,\" the US official said.\"We do think that we're seeing some progress. There are some tricky issues, which I think the government is working its way through,\" the official added.On the sidelines of the summit, Kerry will hold a meeting with the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.He will meet Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay in bid to strengthen ties with the country, which has remained one of the most isolated in the world.In Bulgaria next week he will \"discuss security cooperation, energy diversification\" and bilateral trade, Psaki said.Kerry would also \"highlight the importance of the rule of law to help Bulgaria develop its full potential as a vibrant European democracy.\" (AFP)","951":"China has conducted a set of regular military exercises near the Korean Peninsula, according to China's defense ministry and state media Saturday.The Chinese People's Liberation Army began eight days of \"military missions\" Friday in the northern parts of the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Strait, adjacent to the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese defense ministry said in a notice posted on its website.

A fourth suspect \u2013 the common law wife of the market attacker \u2013 was still at large and believed to be armed.Medical teams evacuate a person on a stretcher as members of the BRI police elite unit launch an assault on the HyperCasher supermarket at Porte de Vincennes in Eastern Paris on Friday. YonhapAl-Qaida's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack against the publication Charlie Hebdo to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly's satire.The brothers were not unknown to authorities: One had a terrorism-related conviction for ties to a network sending fighters to battle American forces in Iraq, and both were on the U.S. no-fly list, according to a U.S. official.President Francois Hollande urged his nation to remain united and vigilant, and the city shut down a famed Jewish neighborhood amid fears of more violence.``The threats facing France are not finished,'' Hollande said. ``We are a free people who cave to no pressure.''The drama, which played out on live TV and social media, began with the brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi methodically massacring 12 people Wednesday at the Charlie Hebdo offices, stopping to shoot a wounded police officer in the head before escaping by car.On Thursday, a gunman police identified as Amedy Coulibaly shot a policewoman to death south of Paris, although authorities were not sure at first if it was related to the Charlie Hebdo shootings.It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids in two locations: a printing plant in the town of Dammartin-en-Goele, northeast of Paris, where the Kouachis were holed up, and the Paris supermarket where Coulibaly killed four hostages and threatened more violence unless the police let the Kouachis go.As scores of black-clad security forces surrounded both sites, booming explosions, heavy gunfire and dense smoke heralded the news that the twin sieges finally had ended.The three gunmen were dead \u2013 but the authorities also discovered four dead hostages at the market. Sixteen hostages were freed, one from the printing plant and 15 others from the store.The attackers had ties both to each other and to terrorist activities that reached back years and extended from Paris to al-Qaida in Yemen. They epitomized Western authorities' greatest fear: Islamic radicals who trained abroad and came home to stage attacks.After the killings at the Charlie Hebdo offices, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his 34-year-old brother Said led police on a chase around northeastern France, robbing a gas station and stealing a car before ending up at the printing plant in Dammartin-en-Goele, near Charles de Gaulle airport. One of the brothers was wounded in the neck at one point during a shootout with police after he commandeered a car, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.Authorities said the brothers temporarily took a man hostage at the plant but let him go, and a second man was later discovered to have been hiding inside the building.A member of the al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula gave a statement in English to The Associated Press saying the group's leadership ``directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully.''The attack was in line with warnings from the late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to the West about ``the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslim sanctities,'' the member said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the group's regulations do not permit him to give his name.He said the group has delayed its declaration of responsibility for ``security reasons.''The brothers were cornered there for much of the day before the explosions and gunfire rang out in the twilight and a police SWAT team clambered onto the roof. ``They said they want to die as martyrs,'' Yves Albarello, a local lawmaker inside the command post, told French television station i-Tele. At the kosher grocery near the Porte de Vincennes neighborhood of the capital, the gunman burst in shooting just a few hours before the Jewish Sabbath began, declaring ``You know who I am,'' the official recounted. The attack came before sundown when the store would have been crowded with shoppers, and Hollande called it ``a terrifying anti-Semitic act.''Coulibaly killed the four people in the market shortly after entering, Molins said.Several people wounded in the grocery store were able to flee and get medical care, the official said. About 100 students were locked down in nearby schools and the highway ringing Paris was closed.The mayor's office also shut down all shops along Rosiers Street in the city's famed Marais neighborhood in the heart of the tourist district. Hours before the Jewish Sabbath, the street is usually crowded with shoppers. The street is also only a kilometer from Charlie Hebdo's offices.Charles de Gaulle airport, not far from the standoff in Dammartin-en-Goele,\u00a0 briefly closed two runways to arrivals, and Hollande held a series of crisis meetings with his security team throughout the day.Police released a photo of Coulibaly and his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, described as an accomplice.Authorities increasingly grew to see links between the attackers after they discovered that Boumeddiene and the companion of one of the Kouachi brothers had exchanged about 500 phone calls, Molins said.He added that several people have been given preliminary charges in the investigation. They include relatives of the three gunmen. Several people who were wounded when the gunman opened fire in the grocery store fled and got medical care, the official said. Minutes before police stormed both sites, Coulibaly had threatened more violence if authorities launched an assault on the two brothers, a police official said. A group of people holed up in the supermarket's freezer _ apparently unbeknownst to the gunman.BFM also said it spoke with Coulibaly, who said he and the Kouachis were coordinating their actions, and that he was with the militant Islamic State group. The organizations are normally rivals. The TV station said Coulibaly didn't hang up properly after the phone call and that this allowed police to hear him saying a final prayer before his death, perhaps suggesting that this prompted the police raid.In the final assault, phalanxes of security forces converged on the store entrance behind a flash from a stun grenade _ and fired inside. Frenzied civilians _ one of them carrying a toddler _ scurried out under escort by helmeted police in body armor. Police said Coulibaly had been a co-suspect with Cherif Kouachi in a court case involving terrorism that never made it to trial.Cherif Kouachi was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for ties to a network sending jihadis to fight U.S. forces in Iraq. According to a Yemeni security official, Said Kouachi is suspected of having fought for al-Qaida in Yemen. Another senior security official added that Said was in Yemen until 2012. Both officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation into Kouachi's stay in Yemen. Both brothers were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss foreign intelligence publicly.The attacks in France as well as a hostage siege last month in Sydney and the October killing of a solder near Canada's parliament prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a global travel warning for Americans. It also cites an increased risk of reprisals against U.S. and Western targets for the U.S.-led intervention against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.Authorities around Europe have warned of the threat posed by the return of Western jihadis trained in warfare. France counts at least 1,200 citizens in the war zone in Syria _ headed there, returned or dead. Both the Islamic State group and al-Qaida have threatened France, home to Western Europe's largest Muslim population.The publication Charlie Hebdo had long drawn threats for its depictions of Islam, although it also lampooned other religions and political figures. It had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, and a sketch of Islamic State's leader was the last tweet sent by the irreverent newspaper minutes before the attack.Eight journalists, two police officers, a maintenance worker and a visitor were killed in the newspaper attack, including the paper's editor. Charlie Hebdo plans a special edition next week, produced in the offices of another paper.

No co-hosting plan is under government consideration, it said.The possibility of co-hosting was first raised when the International Olympics Committee (IOC) in December approved a set of recommendations for its Olympic 2020 Agenda, which included a cost-saving option for an Olympic host city to co-host the games with foreign cities.The move raised the possibility of co-hosting the PyeongChang Olympics with the Japanese city of Nagano, the host of the 1998 Winter Olympics, while local civic groups proposed co-hosting with North Korea.PyeongChang won the bid to host the 2018 Olympics in 2011, beating Munich and Annecy, France, in an IOC vote, after losing its two previous bids.

Five doctors and four nurses will carry out their mission from Jan. 26-Feb. 20 after taking on-the-job training for five days, it said.Initially, Seoul had planned to send 10 medical staff for the second team, but as one nurse failed to pass the rigorous training, the government plans to send the final and third batch of 11 medical workers instead next month.Seoul's first bath of 10 medical workers kicked off their operation in late December, but one medical worker was airlifted to a hospital in Germany last week to undergo a three-week monitoring on infection concerns.The worker's index finger came in contact with a needle through a partly ripped glove while collecting blood from an Ebola patient. As the team member's blood tests showed negative results three times, there is a very low chance of contraction, according to the foreign ministry.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined US$12.6 million in assistance. The virus is estimated to have killed more than 8,000 people since December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. (Yonhap)","955":"President Park Geun-hye accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo on Monday, a week after he offered to quit amid snowballing allegations that he received illegal political funds from a deceased businessman.The announcement came hours after the president returned from her trip from South America. Lee\u2019s farewell ceremony was held later in the evening. The president, however, remained silent on the graft scandal, with her office explaining she would need a day or two of rest after falling ill during her Latin American tour last week. Park has been facing mounting calls to state her position over the scandal. The president returned from the 12-day trip Monday morning, but has been suffering from a sore throat and abdominal pain, her spokesperson Min Kyung-wook told reporters. Presidential medical staff have advised rest for one or two days for what is apparent \u201coverwork,\u201d Min added.\u201cAdnominal pain caused by stomach cramps due to chronic fatigue was her major symptom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s health condition was not good (during the trip), as she also had a mild fever caused by pharyngitis,\u201d he said, adding that Park powered through her schedule, despite her bad health.Min said the office would announce her forthcoming schedules and her \u201cposition\u201d on the looming political crisis in due time, stressing her health is \u201cthe top priority.\u201d Park was expected to preside over the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday, but she chose not to attend the meeting, according to officials. With the prime minister leaving the office, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who serves as deputy premier, would chair the meeting this week, they said. Lee was one of eight political heavyweights alleged to have accepted illegal political funds from deceased ex-Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong. Park last week expressed regrets over the prime minister\u2019s resignation, saying it must have been a tough decision for Lee to step down from the post. Park appointed Lee, a veteran politician and former Saenuri floor leader, in February as part of efforts to seek momentum in her reform drive. Expectations are high on how Park will respond to the burgeoning scandal, as the opposition party raised speculations that some of the cash received by the eight politicians was used for her presidential campaign in 2012.With Park returning from her trip, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy intensified demands for her to apologize over her aides\u2019 alleged involvement in corruption.\u201cThe president should offer a sincere apology,\u201d said opposition leader Moon Jae-in.\u201cA genuine apology is needed to guarantee a fair investigation into the corruption allegations involving those in power as they are suspected of using the money for her presidential campaign,\u201d he said.Ruling party chief Kim Moo-sung, apparently concerned at the president\u2019s falling popularity ahead of the by-election this week, said Park would deliver a public apology soon. \u201cIn the course of the prosecution\u2019s investigation, the president will apologize, in one form or another,\u201d he said Sunday.Kim\u2019s remark prompted fresh speculation that Cheong Wa Dae and the governing party may have agreed in advance to deliver the president\u2019s apology shortly as the scandal inflicted significant damage to both.The presidential office, however, denied the speculation, saying it would be inappropriate for Park to apologize when there is no concrete evidence to prove the graft allegations. Instead of an apology, the president could express regret over the prime minister\u2019s resignation, as she was the one who appointed him, a Cheong Wa Dae official was quoted as saying.A pro-Park member at the ruling party also claimed it would be too early for her to make an official apology as she would have no other political means to seek a breakthrough if the political crisis deepens to an unfavorable issue to her and her party. The focus of the scandal can also be shifted to NPAD, as the ruling party has raised speculation that the opposition leader may have had suspicious ties with the dead businessman. Saenuri attacked NPAD, saying Sung was granted a special pardon by the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, although he was not eligible. Moon denied the speculations and accused the ruling party of attempting to divert public attention away from the scandal. Moon was Roh\u2019s chief of staff at the time.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","956":"The Seoul Metropolitan Government on Thursday said it would consider giving out a monthly allowance for children of undocumented immigrants, after being advised by human rights experts.Yeom Gyu-hong, one of the three independent human rights officers hired by the city government, said excluding illegal immigrant\u2019s children from the city\u2019s monthly childcare allowance program violated the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which South Korea signed in 1991.Currently, all Seoul citizens with children aged 6 or under are eligible for a monthly allowance ranging from 100,000 won to 394,000 won ($90 to $360), depending on the child\u2019s age. However, illegal immigrants who reside in Seoul are not eligible for any allowance for raising or educating their children.Among the 12 citizen representatives selected by the SMG to make their decision on the matter, eight voted in favor of the rights of undocumented children during their hearing last month. \u201cThe citizen representatives concluded that excluding illegal immigrants from the childcare benefits is an act of discrimination on the basis of their nationality, and we have put this into our decision to advise the SMG,\u201d the human rights experts said in a statement. Article 2 of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child\u2019s rights to education and protection must be ensured regardless of the parent\u2019s or legal guardian\u2019s race; color; sex; religion; or national, ethnic or social origin; among others. Article 8 of the convention also states that if a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, \u201cStates Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to reestablishing speedily his or her identity.\u201dPark Sook-mi from the SMG also said article 2 of the Human Rights Ordinance of SMG applies to those who stay in Seoul temporarily as Seoul citizens. \u201cThere are about 400,000 foreigners who live in Seoul and we strive to be a global city that values and promotes human rights,\u201d said Yeom. \u201cThe SMG should pay more attention to this matter and come up with a proactive plan to protect them.\u201dIn response to the experts\u2019 advice, the SMG said it would launch a study to find out exactly how many illegal immigrants with children reside in Seoul. \u201cAfter that has been done, we can talk about the needed budget and other things to bring (about) this change,\u201d said Park.

(AFP)","958":"The South Korean government said Thursday it will publish a list of overseas Internet shopping sites that have repeated records of customer complaints, a move aimed at protecting local consumers.The move comes as part of a three-year government policy directive that will be effective from this year.Under the directive, approved at a policy coordination meeting earlier in the day, the Fair Trade Commission will monitor overseas-based shopping sites that have caused problems for local customers. The number of people making direct purchases from foreign manufacturers or online shops has been increasing steadily over the recent years as more people seek to save money by bypassing local importers and distributors, who often add a significant amount of service charges to the original product price. In a recent survey by the state-run Korea Internet and Security Agency, more than four out of every 10 Internet users surveyed said they have made at least one direct purchase from an overseas site.However, 56.6 percent of those who made such purchases said they had experienced inconveniences or suffered a financial loss in the process. The commission said it will work with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to set compensation for any monetary damages to local consumers since overseas shopping sites are not subject to punishment under local laws.The directive also includes imposing fines for automakers that fail to carry out voluntary and timely recalls on their vehicles that are found to have problems.

It was the fourth-largest quake to hit the Korean Peninsula since seismic monitoring began in 1978. The temblor shook homes and other structures in Taean and Seosan and was felt even in Seoul, Incheon and its adjacent areas, but there were no reports of serious damage.Of the total quakes, 23 hit inland regions with the remainder occurring beneath the sea. By region, 10 quakes were detected in the southeastern city of Daegu and its surrounding North Gyeongsang Province, and seven in North Korea. South Korea is deemed relatively safe from major earthquakes as it is situated deep inside the Eurasian tectonic plate, with the closest major fault line a thousand kilometers away. (Yonhap)","960":"North Korea has expressed regret over the killing of four Chinese citizens by a runaway North Korea soldier late last month and the alleged perpetrator was shot dead during a manhunt, according to China's foreign ministry Thursday. The North Korean soldier crossed into the Chinese border town of Nanping, just north of the Tumen River overlooking North Korea's North Hamkyong Province, and killed four elderly Chinese people on Dec. 28 last year during a robbery attempt.China has lodged a rare diplomatic protest with North Korea over the killing, but appears keen to avoid further straining ties with its only treaty ally, Pyongyang, describing the border incident as \"an individual criminal case.\" \"After the incident occurred, the Chinese police immediately launched a manhunt operation. During the operation, the killer was shot and died later after medical treatment failed to revive him,\"China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement posted on the ministry's website on late Wednesday. \"The DPRK (North Korea) side expressed its regret that such an incident happened, and conveyed its sympathy to the family of the victims,\" Hong said. \"This is an individual criminal case,\" Hong said, adding that the two nations have been \"carrying out follow-up investigations and dealing with the case in accordance with the law.\" It is not uncommon for North Korean soldiers or citizens to cross the border into Chinese towns and attempt robberies.In December 2013, a North Korean defector in his 20s killed an elderly Chinese couple in the Chinese border city of Yanji and stole 20,000 yuan (US$3,210). The North Korean defector was caught by Chinese authorities after fleeing to Beijing. (Yonhap)","961":"Hong Kong will take the next step in its contentious political reform process Wednesday when the government unveils new proposals for how the city should choose its next leader.Tensions remain high following more than two months of mass protests for fully free elections that failed to win concessions for pro-democracy campaigners.China has pledged that voters in Hong Kong can elect the city's next chief executive in 2017 -- the first time there has ever been a public vote.But China insists that only two or three candidates can stand, and that they will be vetted by a loyalist committee.That decision sparked mass rallies from September that brought tens of thousands onto the streets at their height, before protest camps were cleared in December.Wednesday sees the launch of a second public consultation on the electoral process, with more specific proposals expected to be outlined by the government.The consultation document will be presented to Hong Kong's de facto parliament and posted online so that residents can give their views.But while the government has billed the reform process as \"historic\", campaigners have branded it fake democracy and have little hope that the new consultation will offer meaningful changes.The second round of consultation is the last official gauge of public opinion before a finalised proposal on electoral reform is put before the legislative council.Pro-democracy lawmakers have vowed to vote against the plan unless it revokes the vetting of candidates -- something that authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have consistently said is out of the question.If the final framework fails to pass with a two thirds majority it would mean a delay in the introduction of universal suffrage to Hong Kong.But activists say they would rather have no public vote in 2017 if it is not fully free.Ahead of the consultation, chief executive Leung Chun-ying warned against further protests, saying Tuesday that \"coercive actions that are illegal or disrupt social order\" would not influence government policy.Pro-democracy lawmakers said they feared that any apparent concessions in the consultation document would be window dressing, with one describing it as a \"large-scale propaganda exercise\".Currently the chief executive is chosen by a pro-Beijing committee.Although the protest camps have been cleared there is still discontent and fears over China's increasing influence on the semi-autonomous city.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un expressed wishes in his New Year address to hold high-level talks with the South. Top Seoul officials have welcomed Kim\u2019s gesture.The resolution is expected to offer much-needed domestic political support to South Korean President Park Geun-hye\u2019s efforts to thaw relations with the North as she enters her third year in office. South Korean presidents serve a nonrenewable five-year term and often become lame ducks sometime after their third year.The resolution also urged South Korean officials to \u201ctake necessary measures\u201d against South Korean human rights activists sending balloon leaflets to the North, if the actions \u201charm inter-Korean relations\u201d or cause \u201csafety concerns.\u201dThe leaflets have sparked a public debate as the actions provoked the North to threaten artillery attacks on the South as a reprisal. The leaflets are usually filled with anti-North Korea newsletters and cash, to raise awareness about the differences between North and South Korea.\u201cIt provides the government a basis from which to block the activists,\u201d said Rep. Kim Sung-gon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University Koh Yu-hwan agreed.\u201cThe resolution will prevent a few activists from having the power to sway inter-Korean relations by sending off their leaflets,\u201d he said.Seoul\u2019s main political parties had formerly disagreed on a clause in the \u201cResolution demanding the enforcement of past inter-Korean mutual-disparagement agreements.\u201d \u201cThe National Assembly of South Korea urges officials from both sides of the border to enforce past mutual disparagement agreements,\u201d the thorny clause reads.South Korean government officials and lawmakers from President Park\u2019s governing Saenuri Party had expressed concern over the clause as it seemed to imply that the South Korean government had engaged in an aggressive anti-Pyongyang verbal attack policy.NPAD Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, a chief writer of the resolution, reassured the ruling party, saying the clause was meant to \u201cenhance the spirit of past mutual agreements\u201d between the North and South.But the resolution may have limited meaning, according to one expert.\u201cIt is difficult to define defamation and slandering in the South,\u201d Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies of Seoul National University.The South can\u2019t control nongovernment bodies from criticizing the North, Chang said, and could trigger mixed reactions from Pyongyang.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","963":"President Park Geun-hye urged North Korea Tuesday to quickly come forward for talks with South Korea, just days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un offered conditional summit talks with her.South Korea proposed in late December that the two rival Koreas hold ministerial talks in January to discuss such bilateral issues as the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.In his New Year's address last Thursday, the North's leader said he is willing to hold summit talks with Park, if proper conditions are met. Kim also said North Korea could resume high-level talks and other forms of governmental dialogue with South Korea.Still, North Korea has yet to reply to South Korea's recent offer to hold talks this month.Park called on North Korea to demonstrate its commitment to improving ties with South Korea by actions.\"North Korea should quickly come forward for inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation and substantially handle with us specific projects for the establishment of peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,\" Park said in a Cabinet meeting.Still, questions linger whether the two Koreas could hold any sincere talks as Kim threatened in last week's message that North Korea will \"sternly react\" to any provocation and military drills in apparent reference to anti-Pyongyang leaflets and South Korea's annual joint military drills with the U.S.The two Koreas had agreed to hold high-level contact between late October and early November during a surprise visit to South Korea by a high-powered North Korean delegation. But the North later backtracked on the deal in protest of the leaflets that North Korean defectors in South Korea regularly send to their homeland to try to encourage North Koreans to rise up against Kim.The North has repeatedly urged South Korea to scrap its annual military exercises with the U.S., viewing them as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.South Korea has said it has no plan to make a change with regard to the schedule of its joint defense drills with the U.S.Seoul and Washington have repeatedly said such exercises are purely defensive in nature.Also Tuesday, Park reiterated her call to pass a bill meant to overhaul the pension system for civil servants before her single five-year term ends in early 2018. By law, Park cannot seek re-election.Park called on officials to cooperate with the parliament and hold dialogue with civil servants to ensure a reasonable bill wins parliamentary endorsement.The case for pension reform has gained urgency as the increasing average life expectancy for Koreans could further deepen the pension deficit, though the move has sparked outrage from civil servants who claim the proposed reform could endanger their livelihoods.

In an editorial, The Global Times raised the question of why China's state-run news organizations had not reported the incident until Monday, suggesting that relations \"too sensitive\" between North Korea and China may be behind one of the reasons. \"The relations between China and North Korea should be exercised with common sense in state-to-state relations,\" the newspaper said. Unless North Korea adapts to the common sense of relations, the paper said China should \"guide\" North Korea to adapt to it. \"If you didn't stick to using common sense, social confusion and discord would take place in Chinese society,\" the paper said. It is not uncommon for North Korean soldiers or citizens to cross the border into Chinese towns and attempt robbery.China is North Korea's last-remaining patron, but their traditional friendship appears to have been wearing thin because of the North's unruly behaviors. Political ties between China and its only treaty ally, North Korea, remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in February 2013. However, few analysts believe that China will exert enough pressure on the North to give up its nuclear weapons because it could lead to the collapse of the North's regime and hurt China's national interests.

These may demonstrate Pyongyang's crossing of a new technology threshold, such as warhead miniaturization, a uranium-based test, more accurate ballistic missile or nuclear fusion capabilities,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0North Korea could use various pretexts for provocations, such as annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the U.S., U.N. actions on its human rights abuses or U.S. sanctions and other measures aimed at punishing Pyongyang for the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, Cha said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In any event, the administration must be prepared to meet these provocations with concrete measures that acknowledge the necessity of deterring a nuclear North Korea,\" the expert said, suggesting deploying more advanced missile defense systems on the Korean Peninsula could be one way to strengthen deterrence capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cha also warned against interpreting the New Year's address by the North's leader as positive, playing down Kim's calls for improvement in inter-Korean relations and his willingness for an inter-Korean summit as nothing but a usual element that must go into such a speech.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I didn't read anything special in the North Korean New Year's speech ... If you're the speechwriter for the North Korea New Year's speech, you've got to sort of check that box, right? You have to say, oh yeah, I have to say something about inter-Korean relations,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That to me is not surprising at all. I don't think there is anything outside of that that is unusually positive in terms of a New Year's speech. In fact, if you read the rest of the New Year's speech, it's quite concerning because it talks about inflexibility on 'Byeongjin' and just continuing with the same line. It's not positive at all,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Byeongjin refers to the North's policy of seeking nuclear and economic development at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cha also called on the U.S. to work harder to help mend long-strained bilateral relations between South Korea and Japan, saying three-way cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo should be seen as the most reliable source of stability in Asia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expert said that the White House should seek defense agreements with the two allies, such as a military parts servicing agreement and a collective defense statement, just as the three nations concluded an intelligence sharing memorandum of understanding last month, though the MOU was limited to information on North Korea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cha said that the U.S. should also be prepared to cope with growing cyber-attacks from the North and try to use the issue of human rights to supplement traditional defense, deterrence and denuclearization policies toward the North.

We also call on Lotte to deal with the media as soon as possible should accidents occur.\u201dThe lower floors of the 123-story skyscraper were opened to the public in October, with permission granted by Seoul City, while the upper levels are still under construction. Since the opening, 13 safety incidents have occurred at the property, including a water leak at its aquarium, cracks in the concrete and a faulty movie screen leading to the theater having to shut down for safety inspections. Last month, a worker was found dead at the construction site of the skyscraper, which will be the tallest building in South Korea once completed in 2016.In spite of the high number of accidents, Jin from the Seoul City insisted that no \u201cstructural faults\u201d were found during the inspection held by the city government, and Lotte\u2019s poor handling of the media following the incidents have overly aggravated citizens\u2019 anxiety over safety.For example, when a fracture was found on the floor of the underground parking garage of the mall last week, Jin said Lotte made the public unnecessarily anxious by not sharing the problem with the media immediately.\u201cThere were no structural problems and the crack was caused by the surface drying with the change of temperature,\u201d Jin said.\u201cAnd the lack of information often makes the public more concerned (than they should be). I don\u2019t think Lotte was trying to hide anything. They just dealt with the media very poorly.\u201dLotte Group, South Korea\u2019s fifth-largest conglomerate, made a public apology last month for the safety accidents at the shopping and entertainment complex.

The fine for smoking indoors at public restaurants or coffee shops is now 100,000 won, while shop owners who allow indoor smoking can now be fined up to 5 million won.But cigarette displays at local retail stores were already empty on the first day of the year, as smokers hoarded cigarettes before the price hike took effect. Local store owners saw it as a bad omen.\u201cIt\u2019s not good for business,\u201d a store owner in downtown Seoul said when asked about her empty cigarette stalls. \u201cI wish I had some packs to sell, but they\u2019re all out, and I won\u2019t get any new deliveries until Saturday.\u201dOther store owners reported only a few sales, or none at all, on Thursday.Tobacco industry officials were rumored to be warning local retailers to prepare for a cold winter, as the price hike was expected to depress sales and revenue and persuade more smokers to try to quit. But revenue could rebound later this year, as smokers who initially try to quit resume their habits, analysts said.Small retail shops across Korea generally depend on cigarettes for up to 60 percent of their revenue. But with the increase in prices, some local stores could shut down, or suffer hits in their sales.\u201cEvery time we sell a pack, we take about 3 to 5 percent of the entire cost,\u201d one local 7-Eleven owner said. \u201cBut with the price rise, the increase in revenue will not make up for the loss in total sales.\u201dThere were also some price discrepancies.

Abe's trip is seen as a bellwether of the ties amid widespread views that the relations are unlikely to improve unless he offers a sincere apology.Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation, seen as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's \"pivot to Asia\" initiative aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.\"We believe that a better, closer, more constructive relationship between Japan and the ROK contributes to peace and security in Northeast Asia,\" Medeiros said. \"That approach ... should be one that is honest and forthright and focus on the future.\"Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the U.S. has encouraged Abe to constructively address historical issues \"consistent with Japan's past statements,\" apparently referring to previous statements of apology, such as the Kono and Murayama statements that have served as the basis for Seoul's relations with Tokyo.

Cho is appealing to the Supreme Court. If the nation\u2019s highest court upholds Seoul District Court\u2019s decision, he will lose his post and be asked to return some 3 billion won in campaign funds. Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon. (Yonhap)The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is expected to be announced in one year. In the meantime, Cho\u2019s major projects as Seoul education chief, including the controversial plan to reduce the number of elite high schools in Seoul, may be affected by his weakened position and the court\u2019s ruling. The district court concluded that Cho spread false claims that Koh was a permanent resident of the United States and that he was using his resident status to educate his two children overseas. During the campaign, Koh, a lawyer-turned-politician, publicly explained he did not hold permanent residency in the U.S., and his children were U.S. citizens by birth. After Koh\u2019s explanation was proven to be valid, Cho continued to accuse Koh with the allegations during his campaign, the court said.Cho, a former sociology professor and the only liberal candidate, won an unexpected victory in the Seoul education chief election last year, beating two conservative frontrunners, including Koh. His key pledges included increasing the number of public, ordinary high schools, while reducing the number of private elite schools to promote equality in education. He also pledged to increase the number of public kindergartens to serve children of unprivileged households. Cho is not the first education chief of Seoul to be found guilty of breaching the nation\u2019s election laws. In 2009, then-Seoul education chief Gong Jeong-taek was removed from his post after the Supreme Court fined him 1.5 million won for receiving bribes to bankroll his election campaign. In 2012, Kwak No-hyun was stripped of his post as Seoul\u2019s top educator after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction on charges of giving bribes to Park Myoung-gee, a rival liberal candidate, in return for his withdrawal from the 2010 election for the job.

In March, more than 500,000 Chinese came to Seoul, a 22 percent increase from the same month last year.The KTO forecast that the total number of Chinese visitors will likely reach a record high at the end of the year to about 7.8 million, showing a nearly 30 percent rise. The number of Japanese tourists to Korea, however, is forecast to drop 10.6 percent on-year to 73,000, due to a record-low value of Japanese yen against the South Korean won.

It is scheduled to end on Friday, according to the Combined Forces Command and Seoul's defense ministry officials. \"The tactical training has been carried out without a hitch,\" said a CFC official, noting that the exercise mobilized about 200,000 Korean and 3,700 American troops and has involved a set of land, sea and air maneuvers as originally planned. Five countries -- Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and Britain -- have participated in the drill, with the Neutral Supervisory Commission observing and monitoring them to ensure they do not break the Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.Drawing attention was the participation of the USS Fort Worth, a 3,450-ton Freedom-class littoral combat ship, in the drill for the first time. The combat ship, complete with surface warfare mission package capabilities, is capable of getting closer to shore than larger ships during diverse scenarios, which brings speed, maneuverability and shallow draft to this exercise, according to the U.S. navy.Foal Eagle is one of two major annual exercises between the allies, along with the computerized command post exercise, called Key Resolve. The two-week war game ended in mid-March.Expressing a strong opposition to the exercises and issuing threats of harsh retaliation, North Korea had fired rounds of rockets multiple times during the exercise period, with the latest in early April when Pyongyang test-fired four short-range projectiles believed to be the KN-02 ground-to-ship missiles into the West Sea.\"The level of the North's provocations during the exercise period does not seem to be as intense as last year,\" an official of Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on condition of anonymity.\"But we are closely monitoring their moves,\" he said, pointing to chances of live-fire drills or test-firing rockets to mark the foundation of the North's military that falls on Saturday.The North has repeated its long-held claims that the exercises are \"dress rehearsals\" for a northward invasion with nuclear weapons, while Seoul and Washington have stressed the exercises have been staged on a regular basis and they are defensive in nature.

The Ministry of Public Safety and Security recently confirmed that all safety countermeasures were properly taken at the facilities.The aquarium and theater at the 123-story building have been closed since December last year after a dozen safety problems prompted concerns. A water leak was found at the aquarium and cracks were spotted on the concrete floor and on a faulty movie screen. Numerous casualties were also reported including a worker who was found dead at the construction site of the skyscraper last year. Only the lower levels of the building have been open to the public since October, with the upper floors still under construction. The suspension was ordered after the city issued a final warning to Lotte Group over its \u201cnegligent countermeasures\u201d in response to the series of accidents.

The main part of the recovery will involve divers who will link scores of chains around the hull to two cranes to pull the vessel out of the sea, the ministry noted. Up to 150 billion won (US$139 million) will likely be required for the recovery, although the cost could increase further if the project is delayed or any unexpected technical issues arise. Still, the retrieval also has safety risks and uncertainties, including the possible destruction of the 20-year-old vessel, typhoons in the summer, and a strong current in the shipwreck's location, Park said. \"The government will spend its utmost efforts to salvage the ferry Sewol successfully through the related bodies' full preparations for the work,\" Park said.

The bereaved families welcomed the decision on the salvage of the ship.They had long called for a speedy retrieval of the hull in hopes to find the bodies of those who are still missing.\"We welcome the official announcement of the recovery plans,\"Yoo Kyung-keun, the spokesman for the families' group, said. \"We also call on the government to carry it out transparently in close communications with the families.\" (Yonhap)","993":"A group of U.S. congressmen Tuesday urged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to apologize for Japan's wartime sex slavery when he addresses Congress next week.Abe is scheduled to make a speech at a joint meeting of the House and Senate when he visits Washington next week for summit talks with President Barack Obama, an honor that would make him the first-ever Japanese prime minister to do so.Critics have said Abe is unworthy of the privilege because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially sexual enslavement, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.\"When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a joint meeting of Congress next week on April 29, he has the opportunity to do right by these women. He can make a full, unequivocal and formal apology on behalf of the Japanese government,\" Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA) said.Honda, who has long spoken out for the victims of sexual slavery, used the 20-minute speech to explain in detail the sufferings of the victims and how Japan's government has attempted to whitewash the crime and evade responsibility.As one surviving victim, Lee Yong-soo of South Korea, looked on from the audience, Honda explained how she, then 16 years old, was kidnapped in 1944 and forced to work as a sex slave in Taiwan while experiencing beatings, torture and disease.\"There is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like Japan to apologize for its past mistakes. A government is a living, breathing organism that is responsible for its past, present and its future,\" Honda said.He also urged Tokyo to learn from Germany.Historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mainly from Korea which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Fewer than 100 victims are now alive and they are dying by the day, Honda said.\"They deserve what has been due to them for the past 70 years.They deserve the justice that has been denied them,\" he said.The lawmaker also rejected claims that Japan has apologized enough.\"To those people, I would say, given this continued revisionist attempts, for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation, the government of Japan takes two steps backwards,\" he said.\"Enough is enough. Seventy years later, it's time for Prime Minister Abe to be clear and unequivocal and issue an irrefutable apology.\"Other congressmen also took the floor to make the case for Abe's apology.Rep.

But the partisan standoff over the pension reform bill is likely to be a stumbling block as the rival parties continued to wrangle over the conditions to be attached to the bill.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min on Sunday said he would \u201crespect\u201d an agreement made by party leaders on the bill. But he didn\u2019t elaborate on whether the ruling party would accept the opposition\u2019s demand.Last week, parties failed to pass the bill as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the revision explicitly state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent. The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner\u2019s average lifetime monthly income.The ruling Saenuri Party rejected the demand in the face of fierce criticism from Cheong Wa Dae, making a U-turn from its agreement with the opposition party to affiliate the issue of raising the payout rates to the bill. Saenuri Party Floor Leader Yoo Seung-min (left) shakes hands with Lee Jong-kul, newly-elected counterpart of New Politics Alliance for Democracy at the National Assembly, Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)Cheong Wa Dae pressured both parties on Sunday to pass the bill during the extra session, and urged them not to mention any changes to the national pension system in the bill. Senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo explained that the increase of the income replacement rate to 50 percent would require an infusion of 1,702 trillion won in taxpayers\u2019 money over the next 65 years.\u201cAn increase of even one percentage point (in the income replacement rate) may pass a disastrous burden on to future generations,\u201d said Kim at a press briefing.\u201cIt is not appropriate to link the national pension to the civil servant pension because such changes require prior agreement from the citizens,\u201d he said.NPAD\u2019s newly-elected floor leader Lee Jong-kul, however, refused to step back and held the ruling party accountable for failing to pass the pension reform bill. \u201cWe should honor our agreement on the pension reform bill. If not, those involved need to be held accountable\u201d said Lee in his first official meeting with Rep. Yoo.On May 2, leaders of rival parties \u2015 Kim Moo-sung of Saenuri and Moon Jae-in of NPAD \u2015 agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. Because of this agreement, the bill on civil servants\u2019 pension reform was widely expected to be passed at the plenary session last week. But another, unexpected condition attached to the agreement involving a change in national pension system instantly sparked concerns from the government. Top officials, including Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, blasted the parties for acting outside their authorities and said it was a matter that required public approval to even begin discussions. Other than the pension bill, lawmakers from rival parties are facing demands to pass the tax-code revision bill. It is aimed at allowing taxpayers to receive deserved tax refund by the end of this month. The bill, designed to alleviate the undue tax burden, needs to get parliamentary endorsement by Monday to allow the government to implement the plan as it promised the people.\u201cIt is regrettable that the bill failed to pass the National Assembly in April. We might not deliver on our promise to the taxpayers unless the Assembly passes the bill no later than May 11,\u201d said Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. Next in line is a bill for free child care program. It aims to fund an education subsidy, called Nuri Curriculum, a government-sponsored free child care program for children aged 3 to 5. The bill has been awaiting approval since last year.Other economic-related bills, such as legalizing crowdfunding and allowing corporates to engage in subcontracting, are expected to be discussed at the plenary session. Those pending bills, however, are likely to face partisan bickering as rival parties have debated the details of the bills. Lawmakers will also discuss whether to legalize putting graphic images of tobacco\u2019s side effects on cigarette packs. The Assembly\u2019s Legislation and Judiciary Committee approved the bill on May 1 to mandate tobacco companies put images to highlight the dangers of smoking.

Separately, KAI has already built and delivered four trainer jets to Peru.Park and her Peruvian counterpart, Ollanta Humala, watched the maiden flight of the first basic trainer jet.The two pilots of the trainer jet received training for six months in South Korea last year. Park gave red scarves to 10 pilots who attended the ceremony.The move came a day after Park and Humala agreed to cooperate in Peru's advanced trainer jet project, a move that could raise the prospect of a South Korean defense firm winning a lucrative deal.The move \"is designed to further expand mutual cooperation in high-tech aviation technology,\" Park said Monday in a joint news conference with Humala after their summit in Peru, the second stop on her four-nation swing to South America.South Korea said bilateral cooperation in the aviation industry could help Seoul and Lima make inroads into the aviation market in South America, currently dominated by Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA.The comments came as KAI is competing with foreign rivals to win a deal worth about $1 billion for Peru's next-generation light attack aircraft.KAI has offered its FA-50 supersonic jets, a light attack variant of the T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic trainer jet that was developed with U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin.

Later in the day, she left for Chile, the third stop on her trip. (Yonhap)","996":"The main opposition party said Monday it will take steps to impeach Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo under growing bribery suspicions.The move by the New Politics Alliance for Democracy came amid snowballing suspicion that Lee accepted 30 million won ($27,700) from a businessman who killed himself earlier this month.\"Citizens cannot wait any more,\" Moon Jae-in, the NPAD leader said during the party's senior members' meeting in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.\u00a0\"Our party will seek a dismissal proposal bill to secure a fair investigation and minimize an administration vacuum.\" The prime minister is in no position to carry out normal official duties, Moon said, adding it would be unprecedented if Lee undergoes a prosecution probe in his capacity as a sitting prime minister.The NPAD will soon hold a meeting to decide on the impeachment action, the opposition party leader said, calling for the ruling Saenuri Party's cooperation in setting a parliamentary schedule to process the motion.Despite calls for his resignation from the opposition bloc as well as some ruling party members, the prime minister has insisted he will retain the second-highest official job, denying the bribery allegations.President Park Geun-hye has said she will make a decision on Lee's fate after returning home from her 12-day trip to South America early next week.The Park administration and the ruling party have been roiled in the bribery scandal which erupted earlier this month when Sung Wan-jong, the former head of a mid-size construction firm, left a list of heavyweight politicians whom, Sung claimed, he has given money. Sung hanged himself amid a widening prosecution investigation into embezzlement allegations. A prosecution probe is underway over the bribery scandal, which also involves Park's former and incumbent chief secretaries and ruling party bigwigs.The scandal comes to the fore as the parties are campaigning for parliamentary by-elections slated for April 29 where four seats are up for grabs.A group of seven ruling party lawmakers pressured the prime minister to step down.\"Prime Minister Lee should file for resignation even before any evidence comes out from the judiciary because he is heavily burdening the president's state management and the ruling party's reform drive,\" Rep. Ha Tae-keung said during a morning meeting of the first- and second-term lawmakers.The parliament can initiate an impeachment motion against a prime minister if one-third of the lawmakers endorse it. The impeachment proceedings would be referred to the Constitutional Court if half of the 294-strong National Assembly votes in favor.Eight impeachment bills have been proposed against prime ministers, but none of them passed through the National Assembly. (Yonhap)","997":"The presidential office called Sunday for the swift passage of a controversial bill to reform the public employee pension system as the National Assembly is set to open an extra session this week.The bill to restructure the debt-ridden pension plan for government employees has been at the center of the Park Geun-hye government's recent reform drive. The much-awaited passage of the bill, however, fell apart in parliament on the last day of the preceding extra parliamentary session last week as rival parties failed to reach an agreement on the conditions of the bill's passing.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) had initially agreed to pass the bill on the condition that the benefit from the overall national pension plan be increased to cover 50 percent of pre-retirement income from the previous 40 percent. The ruling Saenuri Party's last-minute rejection of the proposal led to the parliamentary impasse.\"The top priority should be put on processing the public worker pension (bill) that is adjusted to the citizens' expectations. The passage should be carried out in the National Assembly without fail in May,\" chief presidential press secretary Kim Sung-woo said in a press briefing. The presidential official said the national pension issue should be negotiated separately without being linked to the public worker pension issue at hand.\"It is not desirable to tie the national pension to the civil servant pension because the issues of the income replacement rate and the insurance rate increase need prior agreement from the citizens,\" Kim noted. He also took issue with the opposition proposal, saying that the increase of the income replacement rate to 50 percent will require an input of 1,702 trillion won in taxpayers' money over the following 65 years. \"An increase of even one percentage point (in the income replacement rate) may pass a disastrous burden on to future generations,\" Kim said. The call on the parliament came as rival parties are set to meet again starting Monday for a one-month extra parliamentary session, which was called after the previous extra session ended without success.The civil servant pension issue is expected to dominate the coming session again although the prospect of the bill's passage is unclear with both parties still wrangling over it.

Curtis Scaparrotti appears to run counter to what U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said during a visit to South Korea last week that the U.S. is not ready to begin discussions with Seoul about whether to deploy THAAD to the peninsula.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think both countries are taking that into consideration right now, in terms of the other impacts that have to do with the deployment of THAAD on the Peninsula,\" the USFK commander said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in response to a question whether Seoul and Washington would push against Chinese opposition to THAAD.\u00a0\u00a0 Scaparrotti also said the \"decision process is under way right now,\" though he did not elaborate.\u00a0\u00a0 The USFK commander is the one who brought up the need for a THAAD battery in South Korea for the first time in June. The proposal has since become one of the most sensitive defense and political issues in Seoul as China and Russia have expressed strong opposition to such a deployment.\u00a0\u00a0 Supporters say the advanced missile defense unit is necessary to meet ever-growing missile and nuclear threats from North Korea, while opponents claim mid- and lower-altitude missile interceptors are enough as the North is unlikely to attack the South with such high-altitude missiles.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think this is a decision for South Korea, having to do with the defense of their country and from my perspective as a commander there, defense of our troops,\" Scaparrotti said. \"The THAAD system, if employed, is focused on the defense of the peninsula. That's what it is specialized to do. It doesn't have any influence beyond that.\"\u00a0\u00a0 During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, Scaparrotti expressed the need for a THAAD deployment to South Korea, saying it would provide a \"layered defense\" for American troops and bolster the capabilities of Patriot and other existing systems.\u00a0\u00a0 On Thursday, the U.S. Pacific commander, Adm. Samuel Locklear, also told the Senate hearing that the U.S. is in discussions about a potential THAAD deployment to the South, though did not elaborate on what those discussions are, including whether they are internal discussions in the U.S. military or whether they mean talks with South Korea.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Our ability in the region to partner with our Japanese allies and our South Korean allies to bring the BMD (ballistic missile defense) capabilities to bear has been productive. And in addition, we've been in discussions about the potential deployment of additional THAAD battery, beyond the one that's in Guam but on the Korean Peninsula,\" Locklear said.\u00a0\u00a0 Considering its sensitivity, South Korean officials have repeatedly said that there has been no U.S. request for a THAAD deployment, no formal consultations between the two countries and therefore no decision on the issue. (Yonhap)","999":"South Korea and Japan Thursday agreed to make efforts to improve ties amid a deepening chasm caused by their troubled shared history.\u00a0\u00a0The agreement was made at a trilateral meeting also involving the United States here as the three countries concurred to bolster cooperation to tackle challenges in the region and beyond as their No. 2 diplomats held an unprecedented meeting seen as U.S. efforts to improve relations between the two Asian allies.\u00a0\u00a0Despite such efforts, there was no noticeable progress on historical tensions that have stymied relations between Seoul and Tokyo at the talks hosted by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken with South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki. \u00a0\u00a0The meeting appeared to reflect the urgency the U.S. sees in the need for improvement in Korea-Japan ties, which have been badly strained for years, due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation, especially its sexual enslavement of women for its troops during World War II.\u00a0\u00a0\"The stronger the relationship among us, and the stronger the relations between us, the better off all three of us are, and I think I can safely say that's a perspective that both of my colleagues share,\" Blinken said during a joint news conference with Cho and Saiki.\u00a0\u00a0Blinken said what Japan and Korea have in common \"far, far outweighs any differences that exist.\" \u00a0\u00a0\"We're not mediating between Japan and the Republic of Korea. We're simply encouraging our closest friends to have the strongest possible relationship because it matters to us. Our ability to tackle together the many challenges we talked about is enhanced when the relationship between us is as strong as possible,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0Cho said South Korea is taking a two-track approach to relations with Japan, maintaining a \"consistent and principled position\" on historical issues while trying to promote cooperation on other issues where cooperation is beneficial to both sides.\u00a0\u00a0\"Although we have differences, I don't think that will be the end of our undertaking,\" he said. \"In spite of the differences, we find ways to cooperate on issues and areas where cooperation is good and beneficial to Korea, as well as to Japan. Diplomacy is about working, trying to find the way to work together while we have healthy differences on issues.\"\u00a0\u00a0Saiki said Japan squarely faces history and the onus for improving the ties is on both sides.\u00a0\u00a0\"Both sides are responsible for making the relationship better, and Japan on its part will continue to make efforts to improve the relationship with our Korean friends, and I'm hoping that our Korean friends are also going to do the same thing,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's \"pivot to Asia,\" aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this week, Blinken expressed optimism, saying Seoul-Tokyo relations now appear to be \"on a profoundly positive trajectory,\" citing a recent series of meetings between the two sides, including the resumption of a security dialogue that had been suspended for five years.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, South Korea and Japan have increased meetings in recent months, especially since the two countries and China held their first foreign ministers' talks in three years last month and agreed to work toward resuming a long-suspended trilateral summit.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this month, Seoul and Tokyo also held tourism ministers' talks for the first time in four years, and senior defense officials of the two countries also held annual trilateral cooperation talks with the U.S. in Washington on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the budding signs of rapprochement, the two sides have continued to spar over historical and territorial issues, with Tokyo renewing its claims to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo in a foreign policy report and school textbooks, while Seoul lodged strong protests.\u00a0\u00a0This shows that any improvement in their ties can easily be short-lived. Tensions could flare anew at any time and genuine reconciliation between South Korea and Japan will be difficult to achieve unless Tokyo fundamentally addresses the sexual slavery and other historical issues.\u00a0\u00a0Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's upcoming trip to the U.S., including an address at a joint session of Congress, is seen as a key gauge of how the Seoul-Tokyo ties will go, amid widespread views that the relations are unlikely to get any better unless Abe offers a sincere apology for Japan's imperialistic past and wartime atrocities.

Seoul activists' leaflet campaign has been one of the main sources of tension between the two Koreas.Lee Min-bok, another leading activist, also began to send such leaflets and copies of the U.S. movie in early April.North Korea has reacted angrily to the resumed campaign, saying the move is tantamount to a declaration of war.In October last year, the North fired machine guns at balloons launched by activists. Some bullet rounds landed in the South's territory, but no one was hurt.Seoul's unification ministry said the government cannot curb the leaflet launch as it is about the freedom of speech, but added the move should not pose serious threats to residents living near the border.

They also hope to ultimately end the division and replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement with a permanent peace treaty.Seoul's unification ministry said that the planned event should be made in a way not to spark unintended tension on the Korean Peninsula, raising concerns that it could be politicized by the North.\"We are well aware of what the event is aimed at promoting, and we plan to provide support if needed,\" said an official at Seoul's unification ministry, asking not to be named.\"But Seoul believes that such events should be held in a way that doesn't spark tension on the peninsula or can't be politicized,\" he added.The official said the Korean government has not received an official request from the activists about the DMZ crossing.Crossing the inter-Korean border requires approval from the United Nations Command and the governments of the two Koreas.The U.S. on Monday advised those activists not to travel to the North, saying that the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad are the government's top priorities.Several U.S. research institutes said that the activists' plan is for a good purpose -- promoting peace on the peninsula -- but the move will not help resolve North Korea's pressing problems of nuclear weapons and poor human rights.

Brig. Gen. Park Chul-kyun, director general for international policy at Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry and Atsuo Suzuki, deputy director general of the Defense Policy Bureau of Tokyo\u2019s Defense Ministry also participated. The talks, which first began in 1998, have not been held since December 2009 due to bilateral conflicts over history and Dokdo.At the talks, Japanese officials were expected to explain the ongoing revision of the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines. Seoul has said that the revision work should proceed in a transparent way and in a direction that contributes to peace and stability.Washington and Tokyo have been working to amend the 1997 guidelines to stipulate joint procedures to handle a series of the emerging security challenges possibly including Chinese threats.

The spending has increased significantly since 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 7.7 percent per year, according to the state-run Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. One of the biggest factors behind this growth is the country\u2019s growing elderly population, many of whom prefer traditional Korean medicine over Western medicine, according to the government. More than 60 percent of Koreans who visited traditional medicine clinics last year were aged 50 or older, and the largest number of patients sought help for back pain and hip or lumbar dislocations.\u00a0\u201cTraditional Korean medicine has been traditionally preferred by the elderly for pain-related conditions because it offers non-surgical treatment options, such as acupuncture,\u201d said Ji Eun-young from the Health Insurance and Assessment Service. \u201cSince the country\u2019s baby boomers, who are currently aged 51 to 59, are entering their 60s this year, the spending on traditional Korean medicine is inevitably rising,\u201d said Kim Han-jung, another official at the agency. \u201cThe population of baby boomers is as big as the total elderly population.\u201dThe largest number of all patients \u2015 60 percent \u2015 chose to receive acupuncture, while 16.2 percent sought cupping treatment, a therapeutic technique which involves suction. Among all patients, 64 percent were women.The number of traditional medicine clinics and doctors have also increased since 2010. The number of clinics increased from 12,637 on 2010 to 14,093 last year, while the number of doctors rose from 20,356 to 23,653 in the same period. Some in the health sector say the reason many elderly patients prefer traditional Korean medicine has to do with Korea\u2019s low rates of prescriptions of pain killers, including opioids. Koreans are prescribed less than 47 percent of the opiate consumption level that the WHO considers adequate for chronic pain relief, according to 2010 data. \u201cAs many elderly patients often fear the adverse effects of opioids, they look for other options, such as acupuncture or hot springs,\u201d said Lee Jong-ho, director of international drugmaker Mundipharma\u2019s Korea and Southeast Asia division.Prior to the release of government data, there had been an intense debate whether or not it was ethical \u2015 or even safe \u2015 for traditional Korean doctors to use conventional medical equipment, such as ultrasound and X-ray machines. Currently, the Korean law allows traditional medical professionals to use all non-traditional medical scanning equipment except for MRI and CT scanners. However, a number of traditional doctors have faced lawsuits filed by doctors who practice Western medicine, who claim it is dangerous for those who are not trained in medical science to use any conventional medical equipment. According to Lee Jin-woo, who oversees Korean traditional medicine policies at the Health Ministry, a number of cases have been won by conventional doctors in the past \u2015 which eventually prohibited the specific traditional doctors from using certain devices. As a part of its deregulation agenda, the Office of Government Policy Coordination announced earlier this year that it was considering a law that lets traditional doctors to use non-traditional medical devices without having to worry about being sued by regular physicians. The announcement triggered fierce opposition from the Korean Medical Association, which represents 100,000 physicians. \u201cBy considering to allow traditional doctors to use medical equipment without any regulations, the government is putting the citizens\u2019 health and safety at risk,\u201d the KMA said in a recent statement.The Association of Korean Medicine, a representative body of Korean traditional doctors, said the latest statistics proved that Koreans needed more traditional medicine that is combined with modern technology.\u201cThe demand is certainly there, and we are aware that the majority of patients who come to us are those with joint problems or suffering from chronic pain,\u201d said Kim Ji-ho, the spokesman of the organization.\u201cOnce we are allowed to use X-ray machines and ultrasound, we would be able to offer more quality services to those with joint or muscle problems, as it will make it easier for us to make a more accurate diagnosis.\u201dIn spite of the increase, however, the total amount spent on traditional Korean medical care only accounts for 4 percent of total medical spending last year, according to the Health Ministry.

China has invited world leaders to the planned military parade, set for Sept. 3 and presided over by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Kim has yet to visit China since taking the helm of North Korea in late 2011 amid strained ties over the North's nuclear ambitions. \"To my knowledge, First Secretary Kim Jong-un is on the guest list for the Chinese military parade in September,\" said one diplomatic source, citing discussions with Chinese officials. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because such discussions are confidential. \"All countries that took part in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression are invited,\" the source said, using the Chinese term in describing the end of World War II. Another diplomatic source said China is set to send a formal invitation to Kim. Still, the two sources said whether Kim would accept the invitation remains uncertain. China's foreign ministry said Beijing has invited leaders of relevant countries and international organizations to the military parade. Last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Seoul and extended an invitation to South Korean President Park Geun-hye to attend the September event in China. Russia has said that Kim is among the world leaders who have accepted invitations to join the May 9 ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. North Korea has not officially commented on a possible visit by Kim to Moscow, but it would be his first overseas trip since coming to power.

The April Revolution in 2010 ousted former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and established a new constitution and parliament as the first Central Asian country. Bakiyev replaced his predecessor Askar Akayev in a landslide election victory in 2005 after the Tulip Revolution.\u201cSince 2010, our country embarked on a path of democracy and development. There\u2019s no turning back,\u201d the ambassador echoed Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev\u2019s address on Tuesday, which paid homage to the revolutionary achievements, in an interview with The Korea Herald. Kyrgyzstan, where 28 percent of the population is ethnic minority, is taking steps to integrate multiethnic groups and rebuild housing and infrastructure. To end corruption, the government implemented the Istanbul Action Plan at the OECD meeting in Paris in March. It also adopted the National Strategy for Sustainable Development aimed at achieving social integration; establishing the rule of law; improving business environment; and eliminating poverty.A string of market reforms has been installed by privatizing state companies; setting up fair rules of competition; and opening doors to foreign investment through free economic zones. Agriculture, mining, transport, communications and tourism sectors have potential for collaboration. \u201cUnlike the Chinese, Russian, Turkish and Iranian companies, which have long operated in our country, trade and investment between Kyrgyzstan and Korea do not adequately reflect the two economies\u2019 growth prospects,\u201d Chotonov said. The ambassador added that Korean companies can invest in hydropower and infrastructure construction. A delegation from the Kyrgyzstani Parliament and Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration is participating in the World Water Forum 2015 in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. Kyrgyzstan is the third-largest producer of hydropower in the Commonwealth of Independent States, generating over 14 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually from its 252 rivers. The country also produces 840 million tons oil-equivalent of renewable energy through hydro, solar and wind powers.The Kyrgyz government signed an agreement with the Korea International Cooperation Agency last year to receive official development assistance.

At the forum, five cities \u2015 Paris and Nantes of France, Montreal of Canada, Johannesburg of South Africa and San Rafael of Argentina \u2015 presented their green projects and vowed to strengthen their anti-carbon drives. The Seoul Action Plan and the Seoul Declaration will be delivered to the U.N. Climate Change Conference, or COP 21, which will be held in December in Paris. Countries are likely to declare a new landmark agreement on post-2020 emissions cut targets at the Paris talks. The COP 21 aims at limiting the global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which critics consider as the threshold for climate change.

Seoul-Tokyo relations are further worsening after Japan approved more middle-school textbooks earlier this month that claim the country's ownership of the islets. Japan renewed the territorial claim again in its foreign policy paper earlier this week, angering South Korea.\"(We) express our bitter regrets over Japan's ambivalent attitude,\" said the resolution issued by the 17-member parliamentary committee aimed at countering attempts to fabricate Northeast Asian history.It cited Japan's frequent calls for forward-looking relations, which is tantamount to Tokyo's attempt to distort its shared history with Seoul. Japan's recent move to adopt such territorial claims in more school textbooks constitutes \"a clear violation\" of South Korea's territorial sovereignty and the committee strongly calls for the withdrawal of the decision, the resolution showed.\u00a0 The parliamentary resolution also called on the local government to make more efforts to counter Japan's continued claims to Dokdo. The committee will submit the resolution to the general parliamentary meeting for approval.A series of nagging issues stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of Korea remained as impediments to bilateral relations, including the territory problem, as well as disputes over the Japanese imperial army's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.

The negotiations are in the final stage with a view to conclude the pact around Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the U.S. later this month.The pact has also been a focus of attention in South Korea because it is expected to reflect Japan's decision to exercise its collective self-defense right that empowers Japan to fight alongside its allies even if the country is not attacked.South Korea has worried about the possibility of Japan sending forces to the Korean Peninsula in the name of aiding the U.S. ally under the collective self-defense right in the event of contingencies, such as conflicts with North Korea.Japanese forces putting their boots on the peninsula is considered one of the last things that South Koreans want to see due to painful memories of Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910-45. Concerns about Japan seeking greater military power have worsened as Abe has taken a series of nationalist steps.South Korea has demanded Japan should win explicit consent from Seoul if it wants to exercise the collective self-defense right in contingencies on the peninsula. It also urged Tokyo to dispel doubts and concerns stemming from history and work harder to win confidence from its neighboring countries.Diplomatic sources in Washington said that South Korea is making multi-faceted efforts to make sure that the U.S.-Japan defense pact addresses its concerns about the collective self-defense. They said they expect the pact to address Seoul's concerns, but did not elaborate.An interim report of the defense guidelines published last year said that the pact will detail cooperation between the two countries in case of an attack not only on Japan, but also \"against a country that is in close relationship with Japan where Japan's use of force is permitted\" under last year's revised constitutional interpretation.The issue is also expected to be a topic when senior defense officials of the three countries hold annual three-way cooperation talks in Washington next week. The Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT) will involve assistant or deputy minister-level officials.Critics have denounced Japan's decision on collective self-defense as a precursor to ultimately amending the country's pacifist constitution. Seoul and Beijing view the move warily as it calls to mind Japan's past militarism amid concerns that the power could be misused.Despite such concerns, Japan's government adopted a new constitutional interpretation on July 1 to exercise the right in one of the biggest changes in the country's post-war security policy.

The municipal government also scrapped a construction ban on its concert hall.Public jitters over leaks at the aquarium and reported vibrations in the movie theater prompted the city government in December to activate a partial ban of the tower in southern Seoul, which will likely become the country's tallest structure at 555 meters when completed in 2016.City officials still ordered the country's largest retail conglomerate to update the safety monitoring results of the facilities on its website and bolster overall safety management measures to ease \"public anxiety.\"\"A thorough management plan that factors in chances of additional safety accidents, is essential as public anxiety lingers despite (results that found) no problem in structural safety,\" said Jin Hee-seon, who oversees the city's housing and construction policy.Lotte Corp., a group affiliate that manages the tower, welcomed the move and announced plans to reopen the facilities next week following a three-day free admission promotion for selected visitors.\"We plan to put our heart and soul into creating a cultural venue and a safety landmark that Seoul citizens can be proud of,\" company president Noh Byung-yong said in a statement.The Lotte affiliate forecast that lifting the ban, which had been a major drag on its profitability, will attract an additional 20,000-30,000 visitors to the high-rise.Visitor numbers have recently halved compared to a year earlier, when some 100,000 people visited the tower each day following its opening, the company said.

(Park Hyun-koo\/The Korea Herald)\n\n\n\n\r\nCarter toured the 36th Fighter Squadron, a U.S. air force unit operating the F-16 fighter fleet, and then attended a town hall meeting with some 200 U.S. troops, where he appreciated their contribution to keeping the alliance and the U.S. strategic engagement in the region.\n\r\n\u201cYou, by being as ready, skilled and formidable as you are, deter attack and keep the peace. I just want you to know that you are what I wake up for everyday. We don\u2019t take it for granted,\u201d Carter said during the town hall meeting.\n\r\nTouching on Washington\u2019s \u201crebalance\u201d policy toward the Asia-Pacific, the secretary stressed that the U.S. would commit the new high-tech equipment in the region, which accounts for half of the world\u2019s population and wealth.\n\r\n\u201cA lot of our newer capabilities that we are investing in are going to be flowing into this theater because of the importance we attach to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see a lot of new stuff showing up here first. And that is deliberate and that is appropriate.\u201d\n\r\nOn Friday, Carter and his South Korean counterpart Han Min-koo will hold talks to discuss bilateral, regional and global security challenges and their cooperation in handling them.\n\r\nOn top of the agenda is North Korea\u2019s escalating nuclear missile threats, a reason why observers expect them to discuss the U.S.\u2019 potential deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, a core element of America\u2019s multilayered ballistic missile shield.\n\r\nTHAAD has emerged as a hot-button diplomatic issue as Beijing has repeatedly expressed opposition to it based on its belief that the deployment would hurt the regional security balance, escalate military tension and potentially spark an arms race.\n\r\nSeoul officials say that the THAAD issue is not included in the official agenda. But many anticipate that the issue would be touched upon unofficially during the talks between Han and Carter.\n\r\nThis week, senior U.S. officials have played up North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile threats, sparking speculation that Washington appears to be underscoring the need for THAAD in Korea and a stronger missile defense program elsewhere.\n\r\nAside from the North\u2019s nuclear and missile threats, the two ministers are also to discuss developing follow-up measures to implement the \u201cconditions-based\u201d transition of wartime operational control.\n\r\nThey will also consult over the issue of crafting a set of documents to replace the Strategic Alliance 2015 -- detailing procedures for the OPCON transfer in 2015.\n\r\nLast October, the allies agreed to a \u201cconditions-based\u201d transfer of wartime operational control in light of evolving North Korean threats, finalizing their decision to delay the transfer, previously scheduled for December 2015. They did not set a date for the transition, but the transfer is expected to occur in the early or mid-2020s.\n\r\nAfter the talks between the two ministers, Han and Carter will visit the 2nd Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the wreckage of the ill-fated corvette Cheonan is on display. Carter will be the first U.S. defense chief to visit the wreckage.\n\r\nThe Cheonan was sunken by a North Korean torpedo attack in March 2010, which killed 46 sailors. Pyongyang, however, denies responsibility for the attack, arguing that Seoul\u2019s blame on Pyongyang was an \u201coutright fabrication.\u201d\n\r\nCarter\u2019s visit to Japan focused on highlighting the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. He touted the alliance as the bedrock of America\u2019s alliance network, stressing joint efforts to bolster the bilateral security cooperation.\n\r\nAt the talks between Carter and Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, the issue of revising the 1997 bilateral defense cooperation guidelines topped the agenda.\n\r\nThe revision work, expected to be completed in the first half of this year, will charter a future path for the defense collaboration to tackle new challenges including China\u2019s assertiveness in maritime disputes, analysts say.\n\r\n\u201cThe guidelines give us opportunities to have reflected on this alliance which has been the bedrock of our alliance system in this part of the world and a foundation of security in the entire region \u2026 give us the opportunity to extend its reach into new domains like space and cyber,\u201d said Carter during a joint news conference in Tokyo.\n\r\n\u201cIt really allows us to open up many new opportunities to strengthen the alliance in areas where that strengthening is needed because the security situation has changed, or in areas where we have new opportunities as a consequence of the guidelines.\u201d\n\r\nThe revision of the guidelines is expected to contain a set of joint measures to cope with Chinese threats and other emerging scenarios.

I will lead the municipalities around the world to join anti-carbon moves and encourage them to contribute to the greenhouse gas emission cut,\u201c he said in the inauguration speech.\u00a0 Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon (second from right) talks with Vaxjo Mayor Bo Frank (from left) and Malmo Mayor Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh of Sweden and Reykjavik Mayor Dagur Eggertsson of Iceland at Seoul City Hall on Wednesday.(Seoul Metropolitan Government)Ahead of the opening, Park met with three European green city mayors \u2015 Bo Frank, the mayor of Vaxjo City in Sweden; Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, the mayor of Malmo City in Sweden; and Dagur Eggertsson, the mayor of Reykjavik City in Iceland \u2015 to share their efforts in seeking environment-friendly policies.The Reykjavik mayor highlighted that national-level efforts against climate change cannot be achieved without local-level initiatives. \u201cThe city efforts are often ignored at the national level. The central government should realize the importance of city roles in environmental issues to better cope with these issues,\u201d Eggertsson said. \u201cI believe the ICLEI assembly could be a strong platform in raising the importance of awareness.\u201d Reykjavik, the capital city of Iceland, home to some 120,000 city residents, has set a policy to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent by 2020 and 73 percent by 2050. Under Reykjavik\u2019s master plan, all electricity will be produced with hydro-electronic power and house heating will include geothermal power. More than 85 percent of vehicles owned by the city use biodynamic energy, methane or electricity, the city said.\u00a0The mayor of Vaxjo stressed that his city government was able to seek green policies due to the autonomous city system. \u201cIn the case of Sweden, the power of the local government is systematically\u00a0strong. The decentralization system has been settled since 200 years ago\u00a0while\u00a0the majority\u00a0of the city budget is nationally funded,\u201d Frank said. Vaxjo in Kronoberg County, also known as \u201cthe greenest city in Europe\u201d with nearly 100,000 residents, has been putting efforts into eliminating the use of fossil fuel since 1996. In an aim to become a fossil fuel-free city by 2030, Vaxjo promoted environmentally friendly transportation with bicycle-only roads, and pushed for constructing timber buildings to curb energy use. It also turns waste into a source of biogas for vehicles. As a result, the city has halved carbon emissions in the last two decades, Vaxjo officials said. Its goal is to reduce emissions per capita by 70 percent by 2025, compared to that of 1993, they added. Malmo\u2019s mayor emphasized that childhood education is essential to encouraging civic participation in local-level green projects. \u201c(The city) has put in efforts to get children interested in environmental issues from an early age. For example, schools arrange a carnival to offer an opportunity for students to create their own solutions for a sustainable future,\u201d said Jammeh. Malmo, the capital of Skane County in Sweden, has pursued solar, wind and water energy to reduce carbon emissions by at least 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels. After the talks, the city leaders vowed to further strengthen their inter-city ties and to share their green policies. On Thursday, the ICLEI members will participate in the opening plenary session.

They demanded the government rewrite the mandate on investigating the cause and measures related to the disaster. (Yonhap)Families of some of those killed in the Sewol ferry disaster last year repeated their calls Sunday for the government to repeal a mandate authorizing a probe into the disaster\u2019s causes.The families claim the probe is likely to be controlled by officials who want to cover up the accident, as the mandate allows members of the Oceans Ministry and the Coast Guard \u2015 two institutions blamed for botching rescue operations \u2015 to sit on the investigation committee\u2019s decision-making board.More than 300 of the 476 passengers aboard the Sewol drowned when the 6,825-ton passenger ferry sank in the West Sea in April 2014.Lee Seok-tae, chief of the investigation committee, expressed hope that the government would agree to exclude its representatives from the investigation\u2019s board.Family members of those killed in last year\u2019s Sewol ferry disaster march from the group memorial alter set up in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, on Saturday. They plan to march to downtown Seoul in protest of the mandate on investigating the cause and measures related to the disaster. (Yonhap)\u201cI am optimistic that the government will repeal the mandate,\u201d Lee said Friday at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul where some of the bereaved families have been camping in protest of the government\u2019s allegedly lackluster effort to investigate the disaster.\u201cIt is clear to anyone who read the mandate that independent inquiries into the accident are impossible,\u201d Lee said.The mandate will take effect midnight Tuesday, if not repealed. It authorizes the Oceans Ministry to dispatch its officials to the investigation committee\u2019s strategy division. They will have the power to audit investigators\u2019 budgets and report the committee\u2019s activities to the government. Critics, including lawmakers in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the minor opposition Justice Party, have also denounced the downsizing of the committee\u2019s membership from 120 to 90. Of the 90 members, 43 will be nongovernment officials. Critics argue that the mandate is a culmination of the government\u2019s efforts to mute the probe.Two previous investigations into the Sewol disaster prompted further controversy as some of the family members claimed all those responsible for the accident have not been punished. Parliamentary probes were conducted in June last year, but left more questions than answers, some families said.Prosecutorial investigations resulted in the imprisonment of the ferry\u2019s crew members, who abandoned the sinking Sewol after telling passengers to stay in their cabins during the accident. Lee Jun-seok, the Sewol\u2019s captain, was sentenced to 36 years in November 2014.Prosecutors imprisoned maritime regulators accused of condoning safety violations and receiving kickbacks, including a Coast Guard official who was imprisoned. The official failed to tell passengers to evacuate during the accident, even though he had access to loudspeakers on his ship, judges said.The Sewol investigation has been a hotbed of political debate, as some opposition lawmakers have been criticized for publicizing a series of allegations against government bodies, including the presidential office last year.Progressives, on the other hand, criticized the conservatives for depicting their move as \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d which they claimed was an attempt to cover up the fundamental cause of the tragedy.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","1045":"The Colombian Minister of Trade, Industry and Tourism visited Korea last week to gain assistance from Korean agencies to boost the competitiveness of Colombian industries before a free trade agreement comes into effect, likely this year.

His involvement in child care gradually improved his relationship with Kim as well.\u201cWhen we first got married, we got into a lot of fights because he knew nothing about domestic work. He only knew how to make ramen and wouldn\u2019t put his own socks in the washing machine,\u201d Kim said.\u00a0A scene from KBS\u2019 reality show \u201cSuperman is Back,\u201d which features celebrity dads trying to connect with their young children without the help of their wives.

We were both working, but I was mostly in charge of child care and domestic errands.\u201dKim and her husband, both 34, work in the finance industry, and spend nine to 12 hours at work each day. The mother said her husband is still not a fan of doing laundry or cooking, but is more willing to play with his daughter on weekends after watching numerous episodes of \u201cSuperman is Back.\u201d Among many celebrity dads featured in the show, Kim\u2019s husband particularly loved watching martial arts fighter Choo Sung-hoon and his daughter, Sa-rang. \u201cI think he didn\u2019t expect someone like Choo Sung-hoon, whose outward appearance is athletic and tough, to spend such quality time with his little daughter,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI think watching Choo gave my husband this unexplainable sense of jealousy and confidence \u2015 that if Choo can pull it off, then he can pull it off, too. Anyhow, it all worked in my favor. My quality of life, especially on weekends, improved dramatically.\u201dA scene from \u201cOde to My Father,\u201d a generational epic of a father making sacrifices for his family as his nation experiences rapid economic development since the Korean War. (CJ E&M;)Experts say TV shows such as \u201cSuperman is Back\u201d and \u201cDad! Where are we going?\u201d are a positive influence on today\u2019s Korean society, where more working fathers are taking paternity leave to spend time with their children. The number of dads who chose to take the leave increased by almost tenfold \u2015 863 percent \u2015 from 2008 to 2014. Kim Eun-hee, a scholar at the Korean Institute for Gender Equality Promotion and Education, said the TV programs challenge the \u201cmaternal myth,\u201d the notion that women are meant to be naturally maternal and therefore better caregivers than men.\u201cBy watching these programs, viewers learn that with time and practice, dads can also become great caregivers to children. The dads in the shows, who at first don\u2019t know what to do when babies are crying, become so much more adept at parenting in later episodes,\u201d Kim told The Korea Herald. \u201cViewers also get to watch the dads grow as human beings as they witness their children grow at the same time. And I think that\u2019s important. No one just becomes a parent \u2018naturally.\u2019 Becoming a parent requires time and learning, both for mothers and fathers.\u201dKim said she especially enjoyed an episode where Lee Hwi-jae, a popular TV presenter and a dad of twin boys, makes friends with other mothers in his neighborhood.\u201cMost Korean men interact with people they meet at work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut by spending more time with their children, they can also connect with their neighbors. It makes their lives more interesting and meaningful that way; their lives become more than just work. Communities are important for both parents and children.\u201dIn spite of the increase, however, the number of dads who took paternity leave last year only accounted for 4.4 percent of all working fathers in the country. Some critics say such TV shows in fact reflect the bleak reality where most of fathers cannot opt to spend more time with their family. \u201cPeople tend to want to see what they don\u2019t have or can\u2019t achieve.

Korean men who complete their mandatory military service must serve for an additional eight years as reservists. The mobilized training program includes shooting drills and combat exercises.The reserve forces were established in 1968, but the government has allowed college students to undergo shorter training periods since 1971 to give them more time to study. The move comes as an effort to ensure fair treatment between those who are subject to the training and those who are not.

The school presented specific plans for improvements, SMOE officials said, and will be reevaluated after two years to see if it has followed the plans. Initial expectations in the education circles was that Younghoon may be stripped of its status due to its recent admission fraud in 2013. According to Korean law, any school that is involved in admission fraud can be revoked of their privileges as an elite school regardless of the evaluation results.But an SMOE official pointed out that the clause mandating the automatic status downgrade was added in February 2014.

The families also demanded the government give more authority to a special investigative committee formed earlier this year to investigate the disaster\u2019s causes. The committee was formed after the bereaved families refused to accept the results of earlier prosecutorial and parliamentary probes, saying they were insufficient.The committee\u2019s mandate, written by the government last month, would put investigators under the close watch of the Oceans Ministry, which some families accuse of avoiding responsibility for the accident.

In light of such sensitivity, South Korean and U.S. officials have only said there have been no official consultations or decisions on the issue. Ahead of Carter's trip, however, speculation had grown that the American defense chief could officially raise the issue for the first time.The U.S. official, who spoke strictly on condition of anonymity due to the issue's sensitivity, did not elaborate on why they decided not to raise the issue, including if there was such a request from South Korean officials, and whether the U.S. still sees the need for a THAAD battery in the South.Carter plans to visit Seoul from April 9-11 for his first face-to-face talks with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo.Seoul is the second leg of his two-nation trip that will also take him to Japan from April 7-9.U.S. officials have said that Carter's trip is meaningful in that the two Asian allies are the destination of his first bilateral visits since taking office earlier this year, except for his trip to U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

(Yonhap)","1059":"Disagreements on how to reform South Korea\u2019s public service pension persisted Wednesday among the main political parties and pensioners, raising fears that long-awaited revisions to the debt-ridden system would lose steam and increase public debt.Divergent priorities among the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the governing Saenuri Party and government employees continued to hold down the drawn-out negotiations, despite weeks of debate at the National Assembly.The continued gridlock also comes despite a consensus that the system must be reformed to address growing debt levels. Korea\u2019s total public and private fiscal liabilities could come to more than 2 quadrillion won ($1.8 trillion), government statistics show. The NPAD prioritizes expanding the public service pension to widen the social safety net. But its reform proposal has been criticized for lacking specific data. That makes calculating the plan\u2019s effects on public debt and the service pension difficult, the ruling party said.The Saenuri Party stressed the need to put a cap on the growing government debt, which is estimated at more than 898 trillion won, according to the Finance Ministry. This does not count subsidies to the service pension provided by government coffers.The governing party proposes decreasing overall pension payments to retired civil servants. The plan would increase pension payments to lower-level and generally less-paid government retirees, while taking away funds for higher-level retirees.Public officials, the main beneficiaries of the pension, oppose both plans. Instead, they are pushing to maintain current pension levels, although they have expressed a willingness to contribute more to the fund from their monthly paychecks.Parties previously set May 6 as the deadline for finalizing a reform plan, but the NPAD has recently proposed annulling the date. Its lawmakers say setting a deadline for landmark reforms goes against the public interest. Any reform must be thoroughly discussed, they argue. But the Saenuri Party and the NPAD\u2019s critics say the main opposition party is just buying time due to the upcoming elections.On April 29, four parliamentary voting districts will go to the polls. The NPAD is expected to remain lukewarm on the pension reforms until the polls as government workers are considered to be one of its largest political support groups.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the NPAD is thinking, but they\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.\u201cThey seem to be playing a delaying tactic. But such a move is likely to backfire. Government workers are not going to be the largest voting group in the coming elections.\u201cBesides, the April by-elections are not as important as the 2016 general elections and the 2017 presidential election \u2015 two elections that will be influenced by the pension reforms,\u201d Choi added.The pension reforms are not expected to have a large economic impact, according to an economist.\u201cI agree that the issue is a sociopolitical one,\u201d said Kim Wonshik, professor of economics at Konkuk University.Kim was invited by lawmakers to speak at the parliamentary debates among lawmakers and civil servants as a pension expert. \u201cPublic officials comprise about one to two million of the population (in a country of about 50 million),\u201d Kim said.\u201cThat means decreased pensions are not going to have a denting effect on gross spending, although government spending will obviously decrease.\u201d By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","1060":"President Park Geun-hye inspected preparations for an international multisport competition for university athletes to be held in South Korea's southwest region later this year, an official said Wednesday.The move is part of South Korea's efforts to ensure that it can successfully host the Summer Universiade from July 3-14 in Gwangju, some 330 kilometers south of Seoul.Park instructed officials to \"come up with thorough safety measures\" for the biennial games after being briefed on preparations at a convention center in Gwangju.South Korea said the international sports event, which will bring together about 20,000 athletes, officials and press from 170 countries, could help raise South Korea's international standing.Gwangju is the third South Korean host of the Universiade.

Under the law, centers housing foreigners are not be run as general detention facilities, however the people held there are not free to leave. The report was documented based on the on-site inspection of facilities in three places: Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province; Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province; and Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. \u201cSuch an environment can make them feel like they are being detained rather than protected,\u201d the state-run organization said. \u201cVarious types of protective facilities should be considered for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children or patients.\u201d According to the commission\u2019s analysis on the health records of the people held in the centers, 4 in 10 were found to have experienced mental anxiety due to the stress of living there.

The chairman later received a special pardon from President Lee Myung-bak.In 2011, Chang underwent a special 8-month tax investigation by the National Tax Service, which ended with the chairman paying additional taxes without charges being pressed.The recent investigation is considered to be part of a widening probe into the former Lee Myung-bak administration, including a series of inspections into overseas resource development projects carried out during Lee\u2019s term in office.On Friday, the prosecution began investigating former Chung-Ang University president Park Bum-hoon for allegedly granting special privileges to the university while working as a senior secretary to former president Lee from 2011 to 2013.The same day, prosecutors raided the home of former POSCO Engineering & Construction vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa. Chung is suspected of having created slush funds worth over 10 billion won at the steelmaker\u2019s construction operation in Vietnam.Construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, state-run Korea National Oil Corp. and petrochemicals company SK Innovation are also facing similar charges of allegedly misusing government funds linked to the Lee administration\u2019s state-financed projects.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","1073":"The nation's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it has slapped a combined 182.6 billion won (168.8 million) in fines on more than 20 construction companies for rigging bids for large-scale state projects.According to the Fair Trade Commission, 22 builders have been fined a combined 174.6 billion won for rigging the bidding process of 27 pipeline projects in 2009 and again in 2011, which prevented free and open competition.Violators include such builders as Hyundai E&C;, Samsung C&T; Corporation, Hanyang Construction Co., Sambo Construction Co., SK E&C; and Sambo Construction Co.\"The companies consistently worked together to coordinate which company would win a particular project while others took part only to lose,\" the FTC said. \"The companies have been ordered to refrain from such activities in the future.\"Hyundai E&C; was slapped with the largest fine of 36.2 billion won, followed by Hanyang and Samsung C&T.; Keangnam Enterprise Ltd., Dong Ah Construction Industrial Co. and Ssangyong E&C; were not ordered to pay fines because they are struggling to stay afloat or under court receivership.The FTC also said Hyundai Development Co., SK E&C; and Daewoo E&C; were found to have rigged bids for a 61.1-kilometer rail system linking Suseo in southeastern Seoul with Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of the capital. The companies have been slapped with just under 8.08 billion won in finesThe watchdog said the companies rigged the bidding to keep prices at set levels for the railway line that will open later this year. It claimed that the collusion caused the government to pay more for the work.The FTC said its latest move aims to root out long entrenched bid rigging in the construction sector, adding that more effort will be made to keep tabs on other projects to ferret out illegal activities and support free and fair competition.

(Yonhap)","1076":"ROME (AP) -- Amanda Knox, who maintained that she and her former Italian boyfriend were innocent in her British roommate's murder through multiple trials and nearly four years in jail, was vindicated Friday when Italy's highest court threw out their convictions once and for all.\"Finished!'' Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova exulted after the decision was read out late Friday. \"It couldn't be better than this.\"The surprise decision definitively ends the 7{-year legal battle waged by Knox, 27, and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, 31, to clear their names in the gruesome 2007 murder and sexual assault of British student Meredith Kercher. The supreme Court of Cassation panel deliberated for 10 hours before declaring that the two did not commit the crime, a stronger exoneration than merely finding insufficient evidence to convict.\u00a0 Instead, had the court-of-resort upheld the pair's convictions, Knox would have faced 28\u00a0 years in an Italian prison, assuming she would have been extradited, while Sollecito had faced 25 years. The case attracted strong media attention due to the brutality of the murder and the quick allegations that the young American student and her new Italian lover had joined a third man in stabbing to death 21-year-old Kercher in a sex game gone awry. Flip-flop guilty-then innocent-then guilty verdicts cast a shadow on the Italian justice system and polarized trial watchers on both sides of the Atlantic, largely along national lines.In a statement issued from her home in Seattle, Knox said she was \"relieved and grateful\" for the decision.\"The knowledge of my innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this ordeal,'' she said, thanking her supporters for believing in her.Though it cleared Knox of murder, the supreme Court of Cassation upheld a slander conviction against her for wrongly accusing a Congolese-born bar owner in the murder. The court reduced the sentence to three years. Since Knox already spent nearly four years in Italian prison, she won't have to serve that time. The decision to overturn the convictions without ordering a new trial amounted to a rebuke of another high court ruling two years ago that vacated Knox and Sollecito's 2011 acquittal, ordering yet another trial.\u00a0 Such a direct contrast in decisions by two high court panels is as rare as the double rainbow that arched over the monumental courthouse near the Tiber river during the deliberations. The five-judge panel's reasoning will be released within 90 days.Across the Atlantic, a shout of joy erupted from inside the Seattle home of Knox's mother as the verdict was announced. Several relatives and supporters filtered into the back yard, where they hugged and cheered.Dalla Vedova said he called Knox to tell her the news, but said she couldn't speak through her tears.\"She was crying because she was so happy,'' he said.Knox has sought to resume a normal life since returning to the United States three years ago, recently announcing her engagement and writing theater reviews and human interest stories for a weekly paper in her hometown.Kercher, 21, was found dead Nov. 2, 2007, in the apartment that she shared with Knox and two Italian lawyers-in-training. She was half-nude beneath a duvet soaked in blood with her throat slashed.\u00a0 Investigators determined she had been sexually assaulted. DNA evidence in Kercher's room led police to arrest a man from Ivory Coast, Hermann Guede, who was convicted of the murder in a separate trial and is serving a 16-year sentence. The court that convicted Guede ruled he did not act alone, citing the absence of defensive wounds on the victim and concluding that bruises on Kercher's arms indicating she was restrained while one or two others inflicted numerous stab wounds.The Kercher family attorney, Francesco Maresca, was clearly disappointed by the decision. \"I think that it's a defeat for the Italian justice system,'' he said.\u00a0 \"Whoever was Guede's accomplice does not have a name.''Kercher's mother, Arline Kercher, told Britain's Press Association news agency that she was \"a bit surprised and very shocked.\" \"They have been convicted twice so it is a bit odd that it should change now,'' she said.Also disappointed by the decision was the bar owner, Diya `'Patrick'' Lumumba, who was jailed for two weeks after Knox falsely accused him of the murder and is convinced of Knox's guilt. It is a strange justice for me, long, uncertain, a little opaque, a lot of darkness,'' he said outside the courtroom. `'This is a judicial error in Amanda's case.\"The couple maintained their innocence, insisting that they had spent the evening together at Sollecito's place watching a movie, smoking marijuana and making love.Knox and Sollecito were convicted by a Perugia court in 2009, then acquitted and freed in 2011, and then convicted again in 2014 in Florence after the Cassation court overturned the acquittals and ordered a new appeals trial.That Florence appeals conviction was overturned Friday. In closing arguments, Dalla Vedova pounded away at the absence of any physical trace of Knox in the room where Kercher was found and highlighted doubts about the presumed murder weapon, a bread knife found in Sollecito's kitchen drawer that bore Knox's DNA -- which the defense said was from kitchen use . The defense lawyer also said Knox's false accusation was coerced by police and obtained without being advised she was a suspect. He has challenged the slander conviction with the European Human Rights Court in Strausbourg. Sollecito's defense lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, argued there were errors of `'colossal proportions,'' in the guilty verdicts.\u00a0 Sollecito, who turned 31 on Thursday, sat in the front row during hours of arguments during the Cassation Court over two days, a new girlfriend by his side. He returned to his home in southern Italy to await the decision followed by Italian police presumably ready to act in case his conviction had been upheld.\"You have your whole life ahead of you now, Raf,\" Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, told the Sollecito by cell phone from the steps of the courthouse under the glare of TV cameras.\u00a0 Sollecito has completed his computer science degree, but has said the notoriety surrounding the case has made it difficult to find a job.Speaking to reporters, Maori added: \"He almost couldn't speak. Eight years of nightmare over.\"","1077":"BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping is arguing for strong China-led efforts to promote Asian economic and political cooperation while speaking a major regional economic conference.Xi delivered the keynote address at the Boao Forum held Saturday on Hainan island in the country's south, at which he lauded the promise of the Chinese economy despite slowing growth. The Chinese president also celebrated what he said was a multipolar world in which all countries play equal roles in regional development and security. The comment comes as China challenges U.S. leadership in Asia by promoting its own projects such as the U.S.-shunned Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and assertively staking territorial claims around the continent. Xi says Asia needed to build \"a community of common destiny\" that would contribute to world prosperity.","1078":"South Korea and the United States launched a large-scale joint maritime field training exercise on Friday to strengthen interoperability in amphibious operations between the allies' forces, the Navy here said Friday.The five-day war game in South Korea's southern port city of Pohang is part of the allies' annual landing drill -- known as Ssangyong in South Korea and the Korean Marine Exchange Program in the U.S. -- that began on Monday.For the maneuvers, some 7,600 marines and sailors of the two nations, and about 30 naval vessels, 80 aircraft and 40 armored vehicles are to be mobilized, according to the Navy.\"Among them are three U.S. amphibious ships -- the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard, the amphibious transport dock ship USS Green Bay and the Whidbey Island-class amphibious dock landing ship USS Ashland,\" the Navy said.Under a variety of scenarios of enemies' threats, the troops will practice maritime reconnaissance, infiltration as well as large-scale gunfire exercises, the Navy said.In a move to boost the allies' interoperability, a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey assault support aircraft has conducted take-off and landing drills on South Korea's Landing Platform Helicopter ship (LPH-6111) Dokdo, according to the Navy. \"The maritime maneuvers are expected to boost the capabilities of conducting the full spectrum of a combined amphibious landing operation,\" the Navy said.The Ssangyong exercise is part of the ongoing Seoul-Washington field training exercise Foal Eagle, which began March 2 and runs until April 24 and involves a set of land, sea and air maneuvers by 200,000 Korean and 3,700 American troops.

(Yonhap)A radio communication between the satellite and South Korea\u2019s ground station was established at 1:05 p.m. KST, or 5 hours and 57 minutes after its launch, according to officials from the Korea Aerospace Research Institute.\u201cWe may conclude that the launch and deployment of the KOMSAT-3 have been successful following its successful communication with the country\u2019s ground station in Daejeon,\u201d Choi Seok-won, a KARI official in charge of the satellite program, said.Beacon signals from the 1,100-kilogram satellite were earlier picked up by Norway\u2019s Troll Satellite Station, then again by Svalbard Satellite Station in Norway, indicating the satellite has reached its target orbit.The KOMSAT-3A was sent into space on a Russian rocket, Dnepr, a launch vehicle converted from a Soviet-era intercontinental ballistic missile.Real-time observation of the launch was unavailable as the Russian launch pad remains off-limits to public access.The science satellite is designed to complement South Korea\u2019s three other multipurpose science satellites that are currently operational.The KOMSAT-3A is equipped with an optical lens with the highest resolution so far on any South Korean satellite that can provide clear images of any object greater than 0.5 meter in diameter on the Earth\u2019s surface.It is also equipped with an infrared sensor that can detect changes in temperature, enabling it to monitor any volcanic movements or forest fires.Together with the KOMSAT-5, the country\u2019s first science satellite with synthetic aperture radar launched in August 2013, the new satellite will help enable 24-hour monitoring of the Earth\u2019s surface regardless of weather conditions, KARI officials said.The KOMSAT-3A will circle the Earth approximately 15 times a day in a synchronous orbit for the next four years.South Korea is planning to develop its own space launch vehicle for a test launch in 2019.(Joint Press Corps-Yonhap)","1081":"South Korea unveiled its sixth 1,800-ton-class attack submarine Thursday aimed at boosting its underwater warfare capabilities against North Korea.The launching ceremony for the 214-class submarine, manufactured by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co. and named after revered independence fighter Yu Gwan-sun (1902-1920), will take place in the southern coastal city of Geoje, South Gyeongsang Province, according to the Navy.The Navy plans to commission the submarine in November 2016, it said.\"It is the first submarine bearing a woman's name in our history,\" the Navy said in a statement. \"We've christened it Yu Gwan-sun, to honor her sacrifice and to promote public security awareness, marking the 70th anniversary of independence from Japan's colonial rule and the establishment of the Navy.\"Yu is an iconic symbol who played a major part in the so-called March 1 civil uprising in 1919 against the colonial regime. The Japanese arrested the teenager and sentenced her to seven years in prison, where she died at age 18 after being tortured. Korea was under harsh colonial rule by Japan from 1910-1945.According to the Navy, the ship is armed with indigenous ship-to-ship cruise missiles named Haeseong, or Sea Star, and torpedoes and mines for anti-vessel and anti-submarine operations.The cruise missiles with a maximum range of 1,500 kilometers are capable of carrying out precision strikes against enemies' key facilities.The sub's maximum underwater speed is 20 knots, which enables it to travel between South Korea and Hawaii without refueling.The diesel-powered submarine will be operated by Air Independent Propulsion, which bolsters the vessel's submerged endurance and allows the crew to carry out underwater missions for up to two weeks without access to atmospheric oxygen.\u00a0 Currently, the Navy operates nine 1,200-ton submarines and four 1,800-ton subs, while planning to build five more 1,800-ton submarines by 2019.

Carter also expressed gratitude for Han's \"unwavering support following the attack\" on the U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert, the department said in a statement.The planned visit by the top U.S. defense official comes at a time when Seoul is divided over whether to allow the U.S. to deploy a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense battery on its soil, while officials of the two sides have said there have been no official consultations on the matter. Supporters say the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, while opponents claim it would inflame tensions with China and Russia as they see the move as a threat to their security interests. During his confirmation hearing in February, Carter pledged to significantly beef up missile defense, including deploying more ground-based missile interceptors in California and Alaska, saying North Korean missiles could pose a \"direct threat\" to the country.In 2006, he openly called for a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean long-range missile that was being readied for a test-launch, claiming that the risk of inaction in the face of North Korea's race to threaten the U.S. would be greater than the risk associated with a pre-emptive strike.On Thursday, Gen.

FINA slapped Park, a four-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champ in freestyle, with an 18-month suspension, starting retroactively on Sept. 3, 2014, when FINA collected Park's urine samples.\\The suspension is to end in March 2016, which theoretically gives Park time to prepare for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro five months later.However, a rule instituted by the Korean Olympic Committee last summer could prevent Park from entering his fourth Summer Games.The rule states that athletes who have received a drug-related suspension of any length are ineligible to represent the country for three years, starting at the end of the suspension. In Park's case, he'd be barred from the national team until March 2019.The rule has been in place for less than a year but it has fueled debate over a potential double punishment of athletes for the same crime.While critics of the rule say Park deserves a chance for redemption because of his contribution to the sport -- he's the first and only Olympic swimming medalist from South Korea -- others says he shouldn't receive any special treatment.Lee, who is also a vice president of the KOC, tiptoed around the issue on Wednesday.\"There will be opportunities to discuss this rule,\" he said.\"But first and foremost, Park Tae-hwan should apologize to the people that he's let down and plead for their forgiveness, and take time to reflect on himself.\"Park arrived back home separately Tuesday night, and issued a brief apology through his agency, Team GMP.Lee said Park will soon have a chance to speak publicly about the issue.Park will be stripped of all medals earned on or after Sept. 3.Competing at an arena bearing his own name, Park won one silver and five bronze medals at last year's Incheon Asian Games, which took place after the samples were collected.

On the islands, South Korea has the K-9 self-propelled howitzers, but they only have a range of around 40 km.The North currently has 170 mm-caliber self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm-caliber multiple rocket launchers that have ranges of between 54 km and 65 km. The North has been developing a new 300 mm-caliber multiple launch rocket system that is thought to have a range of some 200 km.The development of the Chunmoo came amid rising concerns over the North\u2019s long-range artillery along the border. Pyongyang has recently shown off its rocket capabilities, while Seoul has largely focused on how to defend against the North\u2019s ballistic missile threats. The Chunmoo was developed to replace the Guryong, which has been deployed since the 1980s. It can fire both 130 mm-caliber rockets and 230 mm-caliber rockets. The state-run Agency for Defense Development developed the Chunmoo, which will be manufactured by Hanwha Corp.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)"},"Topic_name":{"0":"Election party
