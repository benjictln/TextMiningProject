Lee is one of three NIS directors under Park, and prosecutors requested court warrants Tuesday to arrest the other two -- Nam Jae-joon and Lee Byong-ho -- over the same charges. (Yonhap)The three are accused of providing money from the agencys coffers to close aides to Park on a monthly basis between 2013 and mid-2016 totaling about 4 billion won ($3.6 million). Prosecutors suspect the money may have been channeled into a secret fund belonging to Park.They also think that the amount of monthly payments doubled to about 100 million won when Lee Byung-kee and Lee Byong-ho headed the NIS from about 50 million won when Nam was leading the agency. The three reportedly told prosecutors the payments were made at the request of Cheong Wa Dae.Prosecutors are considering questioning the ex-president over the allegations.Park has been jailed at the Seoul Detention Center since March on bribery and other charges in a massive corruption scandal that led to her removal from office.

Korean human rightsSouth Korea on Friday hailed the latest United Nations resolution condemning North Koreas systematic and widespread violation of its peoples human rights.\"The (Seoul) government again urges all UN member nations and concerned parties to honor all recommendations on the resolution aimed at improving human rights conditions in North Korea, and for the North Korean government to immediately stop its human rights violations and take all necessary measures to implement the resolution,\" foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said in a released statement.Chos remarks came shortly after the UN Human Rights Council adopted the resolution on North Korea in a meeting in Geneva. Earlier reports said the resolution was adopted by consensus.\"The fact the latest resolution was adopted by unanimous consensus clearly shows the deep concerns the international community holds over the seriousness of North Koreas human rights conditions,\" Cho added.In a 2016 resolution, the UNHRC called for efforts to hold those responsible for North Korean human rights violations accountable.The latest resolution urges additional efforts to bring those responsible to justice, calling for the establishment of a new body to collect and preserve evidence on human rights abuses in the communist North.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worlds worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.Pyongyang, however, has periodically bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.

(Yonhap)The ethics committees deliberation on Parks membership is forecast to spur the two conservative parties moves toward the proposed merger. Senior members of the parties have been seeking to create a special panel to push for the merger, which they believe would help rein in increasingly assertive liberal rivals and cement their parliamentary foothold.The LKP hopes that the merger would take place before the minor partys leadership election slated for Nov. 13. LKP leader Hong Joo-pyo warned that after the election, conservatives division would \"ossify.\"The Bareun Party splintered off from the LKP late last year amid a factional feud over a massive corruption scandal that led to the ousting of Park in March. The merger of the parties would make the LKP the largest parliamentary force. The LKP currently has 107 legislators in the 299-seat National Assembly, while the Bareun Party has 20. The ruling Democratic Party, which has 121 legislators -- putting it far short of a parliamentary majority -- is said to be seeking an alliance with the minor opposition Peoples Party, currently at 40 seats. As the LKPs reform efforts have accelerated, speculation has risen that some Bareun Party members could defect to the LKP to push for what they call a \"grand integration\" among right-wing politicians.Any defection would cause the Bareun Party to lose its status as a parliamentary negotiating bloc, for which at least 20 legislators is required.

(Yonhap)The spokesman made the remarks in response to a question seeking comments on Japans protest against the Seoul governments push. The Japanese said that pushing for UNESCO listing of related documents might run counter to the spirit of a controversial deal reached between the two countries to address grievances on wartime atrocities committed by Japan. In December 2015, the two countries reached the deal under which they agreed to \"finally and irreversibly\" resolve the comfort women issue. Tokyo gave an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.According to historians, more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude in front-line Japanese brothels during World War II, when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony. Those sex slaves were euphemistically called \"comfort women.\" Japan has long attempted to whitewash the dark history.Saying that the deal lacks a public consensus, the Moon Jae-in government is currently reviewing the process by which it was reached under the previous administration, hinting that it could be scrapped or revised. Japan says that both countries have to faithfully enforce what was agreed upon by their governments.

As ASEAN generally suffers from a shortage and dilapidation of infrastructure, Korea\u2019s expertise in industrial and infrastructural development comes in handy, particularly in the frontier fields of smart transportation, renewable energy and information and communication technology, industry experts said at the fifth ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Wednesday.The event was jointly organized by the ASEAN-Korea Center and Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and invited many high-level government officials, financial institution and corporate executives, scholars and journalists from ASEAN and Korea.
